"06-04-2007","8816",18,"peteratwar","266580","There is on the hand a lot of racial memory in many peoples of a flood. This would point to some major catastrophe which occurred. Note major is meant in reference to the groups of people and is not meant to relat to the globe as a whole. Further, there is no real timescale in the BIble or other writings which can give an accurate time. Noah I suspect is merely a name given to the leader of a group who survvied the flood by one means or another.","lesz","266610","Granted there are always local folk tales, and these may refer to local floods. Flood catastrophes occur all the time, and Noah's tale goes back to the Epic of Gilgamesh. Still, an Ark that sheltered all the world's animals is not real, however you slice local legends. Fair enough... bible chronology is imprecise to say the least, whatever bishop Ussher's opinion. Still, even if the bible does occasionally refer to real historical events, and I grant it sometimes does, they are embroidered beyond belief. For example, I can buy that maybe the Tower of Babel was a real, historical Babylonian ziggurat, and I can buy that maybe there was a story associated with it about human hubris. Fine, ok. It's still not the source of human languages. Maybe he survived ""a"" flood. But there was not ""the Flood"", except maybe to Noah's neighbours who immortalised stories about an inundation that was most memorable. It is, however, not credible that every animal species is a descendant from the Ark, nor that every human being is a descendant of Noah. It's a story, perhaps with a kernel of historical truth, who knows. It's not actually true as written, not by a long shot.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","11:58 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","256"

"06-04-2007","8816",18,"lesz","266547","As to the topic of the board, I regret that I am unfamiliar with attempts by Creationists to provide scientific evidence for the Noachic Flood, the reason being, of course, that there wasn't one to leave any evidence for science to see. (One has to discount silly expeditions to Middle East or south west Asian mountains looking for bits of the Ark.) Scientists do know what a flood signature looks like, even vast floods such as the release of the glacial Lake Missoula that scoured the channeled scablands of Idaho, Washington and Oregon. They can even date real events such as the flooding of the Mediterranean and the Black Seas -- much, much longer ago than the Noachic flood was supposed to have happened. There is just nothing like that on a global scale dating to a single event a handful of thousand years ago. The notion of all the animals willingly boarding an Ark, being supported by a small human family for months (can you imagine!), then being released at one point to return (by wing, foot and a prayer!) to their points of origin is so absurd that it need not be taken seriously. Either the Noah myth is an embroidery of some more local event, or a complete fabrication. Or god has since lost his early taste for total miracles. In short, there is nothing in biology or geology to support the myth of Noah, so we needn't ask Creationists to find it. One might as well ask them to square a circle or find the square root of (-1).","GiantOreo","266616","I believe the whole Flood story is basically from a place where there was a large flood that wiped out an entire area - over time it was expanded and eventually became the impossible tale it is today. The actual Flood myth of the Bible was actually taken from the Epic of Gilgamesh. The writers of the OT seemed to like Epics - the whole story of Moses comes from another epic - the Epic of Sargon: Sargon was left in a reed basket by his mother in a river, and then he floated down to the Akkadian Palace, the King of Akkad took the child in, raised him as a son, gave him the position of gardener, cup-bearer etc. Sargon then rebelled against the king. He deposed the king and conquered the Sumerian city states creating the world's first empire. It gets gets better - one of Sargon's greatest victories were when he demolished the ""Legendary Walls of Uruk"" - sound like anyone we know?","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","12:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","258"

There's something in our psyche that seems to need them, so the best of them get recorded and passed down over and over. According to Karen Armstrong, folks used to understand the difference between Myths - what she called Mythos - and stories that were factually true; what she called Logos. She says modern people have lost that distinction, and so lower what were intended as Myths to the level of mere stories. She holds that as a loss all around.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","12:24 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","259"

DeMille discovered this when he found that if you filmed a ""religious epic"" you could get a lot of bare skin and hanky panky by the censors of the day. The public of course came in droves and helped make the guy a very rich man. I understand that the sets for one of his original (silent) epics is buried out in the desert. One wonders what people will think of it if its uncovered in say 10,000 years or so!","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","12:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","260"

You are also right that reducing it to a realistic description debases and emasculates its power as a myth. Now, how do you propose we persuade the biblical literalists that their interpretation is a debasement and neutering of the mythos?","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","02:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","263"

I am not at all persuaded that the prehistorical floodings of the Mediterranean and the Black Seas correspond to said myth, but I'll agree that Noah may have had a real historical core to it. So I have read. Yeah, well, I guess one people's scriptures are another people's legend. And perhaps there are facts underlying them all. I still haven't figured out how to get True Believers to tell the difference between Mythos and Logos.

Creationists argue that the large number of flood stories of the world prove the genesis flood. What they deliberately omit is just about 3 of these, The Noachic Flood, Enuma Elish and Gilgamesh share the same area, series of events and and same time period. None of the other floods share anything similar except water. This would actually question the flood. If groups of people all wrote down the flood at the same time around the world, then lots of people survived. That directly contradicts the order of the flood.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","04:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","267"
