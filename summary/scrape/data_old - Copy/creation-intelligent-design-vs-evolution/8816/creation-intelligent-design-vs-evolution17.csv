Every organism in existenstence is the result of a chemical reaction which resulted from the interaction of other organisms before it. How could someone who's religion is science not be aware of that ? Besides, every organism such as you refer to like bacteria act and exist within physical laws that they can't over rule according to their own will because they have no will or thought processes at all. They are mindless organisms. I would like to see you prove your postulate, especially if its extended (as it must be) to include all organisms across all time. I think that you will have considerable difficulty proving a negative assertion such as that. The truth is that we do not know when or how the first organisms evolved, nor do we know exactly how life arose from non-life. But its rather obvious that abiogenisis did occur - even if it was due to divine intervention (assuming GOD is not a living organism and thus had to arise somehow himself). The best odds are on ordinary chemistry having done the job. Certainly there are zip reasons to believe otherwise so far. And then there are still those troubling poilo viruses which we have made. They reproduce, vary, have genes, have enzymes, and can control metabolic machinery. I am speaking about creatures with brains and definate wills, yes; but not free will to act outside of their given natures which is why Dogs don't build homes and pigs haven't figured out how to fly yet. They are bound by their natures. . And I am speaking of things that are alive. Intelligence, creativity, brains, wills all require rather advanced nervous systems. Prokryotes do not. I will not accept your limitation since given any survivable imperfect replicatior the door is open to all of life in principle. No intelligence required (NIR). But man, even though we weren't created with wings have learned to fly, or gills yet we have conquered living under the Sea, or even though we must breathe air with lungs, we have learned to survive in the vacuum of Space. That is the definition of free will. No lesz, you have shown here you don't understand the true nature of life at all by claiming that organisms are self activating, and that they have free will to act outside of their specific design without the interaction of other organisms Man does not need free will for the simple reason that there is nothing for will to be free of. And by the way I believe LES only said organisms are self-organizing - knowing Les that is. And isn't it interesting that you choose just a couple of sentances and change the subject of such a long post that I wrote. You seem so determined to never discuss the meat of anything I write, but to focus on secondary tangents instead Yes thats most unfair, to actually break down what you said and deal with it piece by piece instead of allowing your words to escape actual analysis by someone who knows something of the subject being adderssed. Yes most unfair, unjust, unethical, probably a sin which will send poor Les to hell.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","05:15 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","241"

It could a be a fruitfly or a clergyman. I wasn't referring to origins of life, but to notions of ""free will"". First of all, life had to have a beginning somewhere, and that beginning is in prebiotic chemistry. Where else could it come from? Someone waving a magic wand? If so, where did that someone come from? Second, science isn't a religion. It's method even you could use, only you have to choose to use it rather than ignore it. Your the religion specialist here. Apparently this will come as a total shock to you, but you too are an organism acting and existing within physical laws that you can't over-rule according to your will. If you think you can, I invite to live without eating, or try stepping off a high building and floating gently to the ground without a parachute. You can use the laws of nature to accomplish takss with tools that you couldn't do otherwise, but you cannot go outside them. A number of animal species have similar tricks to extend their unaided abilities. Does this limitation mean that you are a mindless organism? Sorry, but the reason a bacterium is mindless is because it doesn't have a brain, but it can process and transduce information, and it is capable of initiating actions, though without a brain it can't be conscious of them. A clergyman, on the other hand, has a brain and therefore a mind, though often they aren't put to much use. Of course, it's much easier to demonstrate cause and effect in a bacterium than in a clergymen, for example, but still, materialism is still at the root of both their actions. If a clergyman has ""free will"", so does a bug. Of course, if you want to dispense with the notion of ""free will"", I'm ok with that, too. Of course all animals are bound by their natures, and operate within them. This is as true of humans as of dogs or fruitflies. No, Archie, that isn't a good definition of ""free will"". It's in the nature of humans to learn, to understand and use the laws of physics, and to make tools. But lots of other animals have similar faculties, only not nearly as well developed. Chimps make and use simple tools; so do some birds. It isn't a uniquely human trait, as you would know if you kept abreast of the lit. Nope. No animal can act ""outside its design"", not even humans, and I'm a lot closer to understanding the nature of life than any bibliolator who worships the bible and ignores science. So far as anyone can tell, animals have as much freedom of will as people. What they don't share to the same extent is consciousness, but even there, many are pretty self-aware. Consciousness is not the same as freedom of will. All freedom of will means, so far as I know, is that volition is internally activated, according to the laws of physics and chemistry, without an external stimulus. IOW, volition is autonomous (meaning free from external causation), and humans and certain other animals experience consciousness of this volition. That's all we know for now. We do not know for sure, for example, whether consciousness drives activity or is merely aware of it afterwards. Usually you write about religion, theology and nebulous stuff like that. I prefer discussing biology on these boards.

(One has to discount silly expeditions to Middle East or south west Asian mountains looking for bits of the Ark.) Scientists do know what a flood signature looks like, even vast floods such as the release of the glacial Lake Missoula that scoured the channeled scablands of Idaho, Washington and Oregon. They can even date real events such as the flooding of the Mediterranean and the Black Seas -- much, much longer ago than the Noachic flood was supposed to have happened. There is just nothing like that on a global scale dating to a single event a handful of thousand years ago. The notion of all the animals willingly boarding an Ark, being supported by a small human family for months (can you imagine!), then being released at one point to return (by wing, foot and a prayer!) to their points of origin is so absurd that it need not be taken seriously. Either the Noah myth is an embroidery of some more local event, or a complete fabrication. Or god has since lost his early taste for total miracles. In short, there is nothing in biology or geology to support the myth of Noah, so we needn't ask Creationists to find it. One might as well ask them to square a circle or find the square root of (-1).","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","04:11 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","254"

This would point to some major catastrophe which occurred. Note major is meant in reference to the groups of people and is not meant to relat to the globe as a whole. Further, there is no real timescale in the BIble or other writings which can give an accurate time. Noah I suspect is merely a name given to the leader of a group who survvied the flood by one means or another.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","10:36 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","255"
