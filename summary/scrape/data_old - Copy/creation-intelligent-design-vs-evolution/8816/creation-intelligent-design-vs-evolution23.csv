The earth was a flat surface in the old days with almost no bumps and it had a rim around the edge and it was very dry. To flood the entire surface GOD merely had to add the water now found in the oceans. To reverse the flood the earth was converted to a sphere and given lumps and bumps thus producing new dry land. The mystery is not the flood itself but rather the dry land afterwards and how the topology worked out.","peteratwar","284670","Shouldn't there have been a smiley after that ? There have been enough upheavals in the earth for people in an area to believe it was a worl-wide problem. Not difficult to see how the legend was born. The problem lies with people who believe tha Bible is literally true in all its historical facts (as opposes to its teachings)","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","04:51 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","331"

"09-26-2007","8816",23,"Gup20","284529","Many modern creationists would argue that the strata is a deposition order, and the fossil order is a burial order. They might say that specific places on earth where volcanoes and tectonic action were likely to occur had similar climates and therefore similar biological systems. Gen 7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. It seems to indicate that it took 40 days for the whole earth to flood. Creationists would interpret this to mean that the water levels increased for 40 days until all the earth was covered. That means there would have been opportunity for some animals (perhaps those with more stamina -- such as mamals) to find higher ground for about a month's time. The bigger, slower animals (such as dinosaurs) would not have been able to keep up. The Bible says ""the fountains of the great deep"" were broken up and water came out of the earth. Creationists would probably say that the order of sediment layers represents the order of catestrophic deposit. For example, when Mt. St. Helen blew in the 80's it laid down layers that looked very much like ""yearly"" strata layers... but thousands of them in just hours. Creationists would predict finding different layering based on the different types of catestrophic forces in that area. Was there volcanic activity in that area? Was there tectonic activity in that area? Was there earthquakes, how fast did that area flood... these would all have varying effects on the sedimentation process. Additionally, creationists would argue that water run off from the continents would have also played a significant role in sedimentation (ie Grand Canyon). Mt Everest - at its very tip - has marine fossils. Why? Well simply put, it wasn't always there. Creationist models show a much more level earth. They would argue the oceans were not as deep, and the mountains were not as high. They would argue that there isn't a place on earth you can go and NOT find marine fossils, suggesting that at some point every place on earth was covered with water. It doesn't prove that they were all covered at once, however. Creationists use an illustration. Lets say you are bending a metal bar. It's very difficult and the place where the bend occurs builds heat. However, once you reach a certain point, it becomes incredibly easy to bend, very little force is needed as long as it keeps moving. The friction is exponentially decreased. Heat remains constant, no longer building. However, if you slow down too much, your piece of metal will loose it's heat and begin to harden. Creationists would also argue that you are using a common fallacy called ""uniformitarianism"". That is to say you are taking a measured value and extrapolating it back into the past. The problem with this is there is no way to tell that the rate has remained constant throuout time. For example, if we take a look at the earth's magnetic field, we see that it is shrinking at a regular rate each year. However, if we simply extrapolated that backwards at the same rate, the field would have been too powerful for life to exist just 15,000 years ago. The same goes with the Moon's orbit. It is gettting farther and farther away from the earth at a measurable rate. If we assumed (as the uniformitarian does) that the rate never changed, the moon would be touching the earth less than 50,000 years ago. Creationists use this argument effectively against millions of years of strata deposition. Creationists would argue that for this to be measured and calculated, one would have to know how much salt was in the oceans when they were created. Perhaps they were created without any salt in them. Perhaps the salinity of the oceans is a result of the solution that would have occured at a cataclysmic global flood. Creationists would argue that rain has a super-cooling effect. You have a lot of calculations there, and the creationist would ask what assumptions you are making. For example, are you assuming - as the uniformitarian does - that the rate of compaction has always been the same as what is seen today? Are you making any assumptions as to how much material was here to start with? Are you making assumptions about the material itself? Who observed all this material falling to the earth? I would disagree with you. I would say that if any part of the Bible were untrue, that would discredit the whole.","obvious_child","285379","Except that the flood story is massively violent with a ocean covering sea. Too bad that we have absolutely no evidence of this and we have a fossil layer that in no way supports such as asinine view of the world. The burial layer alone refutes the flood. If it was true, we should see similar mass organisms in the same layer. That means all of the similar sized shell fish, primitive and complex in the same layer and we should see larger organisms at the bottom and smaller at the top. What we actually have is a completely different burial layer with large organisms spread through out the entire column and only found in specific parts. We see a burial column by complexity, not by mass. Fluid mechanics has always screwed up flood models. This alone ends life almost entirely on the planet as salts deposited would prevent plant life and the change in salinity killing off most of the algea and sea weed. You haven't done much research have you. Water from within the earth would be superheated. Releasing double to fourtimes the amount of water we have now would have killed all but the most thermophilic bacteria. No more Noah. Secondly, the whole stamina argument makes even less sense as marine organisms would have all had the same chances, and therefore should be in the same layer. Not true. Are you seriously putting that forward? The grand canyon was not flood formed. http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CH/CH581.html http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CH/CH550.html The necessary volcanic activity to produce even sediment layers on par with the Iridium would be somewhere on a super volcano which hasn't erupted in over 600,000 years. No, it but it does prove that plates move. The creationist model, primarily burmagarder's (SP?) relies on miracles. He even admitted it. To make Everest that tall in less then 5,000 years requires movement on the scale of feet per year, and I mean over 5 feet per year. The accompaying earthquakes, tidal waves, volcanic activity and general rise in heat would have been noticed by someone. Furthermore, we'd be seeing it today. There's no way it could stop so suddenly after moving so fast for thousands or so years. What are you talking about? How can heat remain constant when the rate of movement is steadily increasing? And how are you going to explain the massive slowing of plates from 6 feet a year to 1 inch? Aside from their being evidence that it did. Besides, if there was a change in rate, we'd see the evidence similar to how the magenetic field has switched every couple hundred million years or so. There's no reason to assume there was a change without evidence. You are either lying or are decieved. http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/magfields.html http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/moonrec.html Are you serious? No salt? Right because the fossils we found have structures that are designed for salt water when there was no salt. And salt found in old rocks known to have been on the ocean floor didn't exist? Are you insane? Ever try putting a fresh water fish in a salt water tank? Seriously. Creationism = retardation. Except that it doesn't http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-...ark.html#flood You're right, I'm off. it should be higher as there was more rock material in the solar system then before. Uniformitarianism is wrong here was we know there was more material. Thus the heat issue is even greater. Does the term metaphor mean anything to you?","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","11:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","335"
