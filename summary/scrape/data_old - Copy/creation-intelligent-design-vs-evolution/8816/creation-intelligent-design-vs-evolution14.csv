You reveal your lack of understanding by not knowing that.","Zardoz","260983","For clarification. Matthew 12:29 ""Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can rob his house.""

Luke 11:21-22 ""When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are safe. But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted and divides up the spoils."" The strong man is the Holy Spirit, the thief is satan/ demonic possession. All that is needed for possession to occur is for some event to happen that drives out the strong man or binds him. Since humans can still sin after receiving this holy spirit thingy, it's not an automatic protection from such. Sin invited Just as new vines are woven in and old ones removed from the grape vine, you don't have automatic and eternal protection for simply receiving the Holy Spirit. No matter how Calvinist delude themselves, once saved is not always saved. And in a moment of self rightiousness and arrogance, you too can lose your mighty magical protections and fall prey to the deceiver.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","12:41 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","196"
"04-30-2007","8816",14,"charlie horse","260984","@ Archangel - I've tried to be polite and at least try and educate you, but in this I have singularly failed. This is self-opinionated and staggering arrogance of the first order, and wouldn't be uttered by a true Christian who knew the Bible. Did you never read Matt. 24:13? He that endures to the end is the one that will be saved . You've already decided that you've got eternal standing before the end. Secondly, whilst tough debate is not for the squeamish and those of delicate sensibilities, you regularly pen spiteful comments in your replies (as evidenced to other posters in this thread.) That is not in the true spirit of debate either, even allowing some leeway. By your example it is difficult to conclude that you are an ambassador for Christ (2 Cor. 5: 20) and that a belief in God is worth pursuing. You have all the appearances of an internet troll.","ShadowPikachu","260985","And really, that's all we see from Archie on these boards - him preaching about how he's got eternal life/standing, and unless we believe the same as him, we don't. You are correct, it is self-opinionated and very arrogant (and certainly not biblical, as you pointed out), but I think Archie has a sort of God complex that makes him want to condemn and judge others all the while claiming he is saved, and yes, when people see those like him, it is no wonder that they turn from a belief in God.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","01:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","198"

Here it is in context with the verses that come before and after it. Mar 3:26 (Jesus speaking) ""And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end. Mar 3:27 ""No one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house. Mar 3:28 ""Assuredly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they may utter; Mar 3:29 ""but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation""-- The bolded is the passage you posted to imply that Christians can lose their salvation. The passage actually is about blaspheming the Holy Spirit and how that is an unforgivable sin, which a believer would never do. Now ask yourself this ! Are those people who have right here on this thread and forum, blasphemed the Holy Spirit by mocking and insulting me as an ignorant fool for claiming and insisting that God Himself indwells me by the power of His Holy Spirit ?","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","03:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","199"

You have all the appearances of an internet troll. 2Cr 5:20 Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ's behalf, be reconciled to God.","Archangel","261011","Again you pull one verse out of context in order to make a point it isn't even about. Do you realize that is exactly what the serpent did to cause the fall in the Garden ? By twisting what God said and deceiving the very innocent Eve ? Now here is the passage in context and once again you have misrepresented what it is actually saying. In fact it's speaking to a great falling away in the last days when mens hearts grow cold and hard. This sounds alot more like you and the rest of the scoffers here than me who is constantly warning everyone to receive the grace being offered before the doors finally close. Mat 24:3 Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, ""Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?"" Mat 24:4 And Jesus answered and said to them: ""Take heed that no one deceives you. Mat 24:5 ""For many will come in My name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and will deceive many. Mat 24:6 ""And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all[fn1] these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. Mat 24:7 ""For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences,[fn2] and earthquakes in various places. Mat 24:8 ""All these are the beginning of sorrows. Mat 24:9 ""Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name's sake. Mat 24:10 ""And then many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another. Mat 24:11 ""Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many. Mat 24:12 ""And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold. Mat 24:13 ""But he who endures to the end shall be saved. Mat 24:14 ""And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come. You interjected yourself by wrongly accusing me of misstating that this Age will end by fire. You implied I was in error and I defended that principle. And since then you have attempted to make me out to be some charlatan who doesn't really know what the bible say's when it is you who has misquoted and misrepresented it at every single turn. I will defend the Word of God against anyone who misrepresents it. If you don't want me to expose your lies about Gods Word then don't challenge me. The problem with this verse in using it to judge me, is that it is speaking to those who are in rebellion to God which would mean it is better directed at you rather than me. See ? So charlie, I must conclude by the numerous verses that you have posted, all of them out of context and misrepresenting their true meaning that you lied about attending a bible College and about ever being a devout Christian. You my friend are a fraud. Now I don't want to be at odds with you so I'm willing to start over if you are. Just stop using the bible as a weapon to misrepresent what God would have us believe and we'll get along just fine. Well maybe not fine, but I'll try to respect you.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","03:32 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","200"

We have already shown your error, and how you are trying to connect two different verses, and now we have even given your point to you to try to move things along, but still you moan and complain.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","03:46 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","201"

"04-30-2007","8816",14,"charlie horse","261031","@ Arch - why is Matt. 24:13 out of context? Have we reached the end, or are we still in the last days? Either way, how do you account for being eternally saved? Nope. Read 2 Cor. 5:20 again. You should be an ambassador for Christ trying to reconcile people to God. Such ambassador you are not. 2Cr 5:20 Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ's behalf, be reconciled to God.","Archangel","261049","We are in the last days. But if one truly receives the Holy Spirit, they must literally command it to leave them and it then would do it meaning they have committed the unforgivable sin and would be lost forever. But here are some verses that speak to being saved. Ask yourself if a murderer can be saved. Can He ? You tell me what you think is scriptural and then I'll tell you what I think is scriptural. Rom 5:10 For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life. Rom 8:24 For we were saved in this hope, but hope that is seen is not hope; for why does one still hope for what he sees? Rom 9:27 Isaiah also cries out concerning Israel: ""Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, The remnant will be saved. Rom 10:1 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for *Israel is that they may be saved. Rom 10:9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. Rom 10:13 For ""whoever calls on the name of the LORD shall be saved."" Rom 11:26 And so all Israel will be *saved, as it is written: ""The Deliverer will come out of Zion, And He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob; 1Cr 1:18 For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 1Cr 3:15 If anyone's work is burned, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire. 1Cr 5:5 deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. 1Cr 10:33 just as I also please all [men] in all [things], not seeking my own profit, but the [profit] of many, that they may be saved. Note the bolded. Paul is speaking to the Church at Corinth and telling them to be reconciled to God. It isn't even about reaching out to the unsaved who seek to disprove God and mock Him or the believers who follow Him. Here's verses 15-21. See if you can understand it in its proper context. 2Cr 5:15 and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again. 2Cr 5:16 Therefore, from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him thus no longer. 2Cr 5:17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new. 2Cr 5:18 Now all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation, 2Cr 5:19 that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation. 2Cr 5:20 Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading through us: we implore you on Christ's behalf, be reconciled to God. 2Cr 5:21 For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. So what does this have to do with being nice to people who distort and lie about what the bible say's ? Didn't Jesus throw the money changers out of the Temple when they were treating it like a business ? There's such a thing as righteous indignation and it isn't a sin.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","07:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","204"

Furthermore you just admitted your God is a liar. You state that you believe that the Bible was not corrupted. Your literal interpretation argues that geology is false as it contradicts the bible.

That's not the problem here. Arch argues that Genesis happened in a literal sense. The problem is that there is no evidence for Genesis in a literal sense. Therefore we have a problem. So either God did Genesis as the bible states in a literal fashion and he covered all evidence up (which makes him a deceiver), or that he created a world different from Genesis again which makes him a deceiver. God as a deceiver is heretical to Christanity. This point has been made to Arch several times. He refuses to deal with it. When he posts Fox tv props as proof of creation and uses known lies, calling him a liar is merely stating the obvious. We all know that no one is going to convince Arch of anything. The poor man can't tell the difference between a petri dish and welsh Corgi. What we can do is expose the flaws in his evidence and his beliefs. His outright hostility towards people examining his belief scares me though. Also one can be honest with believing that God is a liar. Arch has huge gapping holes in his theological beliefs in the context of reality. He has stated that sciences that deal with billion year old things are 'fairy tales.' I made several comments about geology to him the context of finding fossil fuels. He hasn't addressed a single one. For creationists, it is simply easier to do what is easy (run away) then deal with theological problems in their belief systems.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","04:14 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","210"
