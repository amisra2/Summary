"04-27-2007","8816",11,"Archangel","260530","As usual, you minimize it as if I posted about a row boat and tried to pass it off as a ship. I for one, make no apologies that it was only 180 feet long. That is thought to be the largest ship of its day, so nothing at all to scoff at.","pandion","260539","But at 180 ft. it did not exceed the structural strength of wood. That happens at about 300 ft. There were many wooden keel/hull ships that exceeded 180 ft. For example, Cutty Sark at 212.5 ft., Thermopylae at 212 ft., USS Constitution at 204 ft., HMS Victory at 227 ft. (the gun deck was 186 ft). Victory had a total of 6 decks (guns on 4 of them). And, of course, there was the Wyoming, at 329 ft., as well as her 6 sister ships - all over 300 ft. - all leakers - all foundered in rough seas when the hulls sprung and the pumps could not keep up with the water. None of them are evidence that the ark was possible. The ark was supposed to be 450 ft. long. I'm not claiming that 180 ft. wooden ships were not possible. Clearly they were. But the structural limits of wood are exceeded at about 300 ft., even if the hull is reinforced with steel cross-bracing, as was the case with the Wyoming, her sister ships, and the Great Republic. In other words, THAT BOAT DON'T FLOAT . But wait! There's more! The Bible describes the ark as a big box with no means of propulsion that was supposed to have endured a violent storm for 40 days. In Dec of 1944 the U.S. Navy lost 3 destroyers in a single day from a storm (2 Farregut class destroyers at 341', and one Fletcher class destroyer at 376'). All three of these ships had headway until their engine rooms were flooded. When that happened, the waves turned them sideways to the wave front. Since the wave height was greater than the beam of the ships (34 and 39 ft) they capsized. Only 35 of the crews survived - 775 (or more) perished. So tell me. How is a bit leaky box going to survive a 40 day storm while the waves are constantly rolling it over and over?","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","01:17 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","151"

Windjammers had to turn stern to the wave front, but no matter how bad the storm, and no matter how many sails were shredded, they still had to fly enough sail to maintain steerage. Modern ships turn bow to the wave front. The three destroyers lost power due to flooding and were unable to keep their bows into the waves. The were turned broadside and capsized. The book and movie, ""The Caine Mutiny"" eventually come down to the 1944 typhoon. The author served aboard a Navy vessel in that storm. If you haven't seen or read it, it's worth it.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","03:02 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","153"

The Ark had one feature benefit you have completely ignored. The hand of God Himself protecting, guiding and steering it throughout its journey. And you know, I never understood how incredible a miracle the ark accomplished for holding together as it did before this, because having always just taken this event on faith, I never even considered the physics that worked against it as you have pointed out. Thanks for clarifying the marvelous workings of God in impossible circumstances. Much like the parting of the Red Sea, and the destruction of the Walls of Jericho at the blowing of the horns by the People of Israel. And don't forget when Jesus calmed the stormy Sea by commanding it. Nor when He walked on Water, raised the dead by commanding them to rise, turned water into wine, or His greatest miracle, raising from the dead Himself thereby defeating death and sin by sacrificing Himself as the perfect lamb of God. So thank's for adding to Gods glory by pointing out the full extent of how scientificly impossible it was that the Ark should survive its journey. Now all it takes is the faith to believe which for you pseudo intellectuals will require the biggest miracle of them all.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","07:59 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","154"

(pun intended) You realized, and stated, that there is no point in looking at the flood, or the ark, literally, or scientifically. Acceptance of the story must be based on FAITH. I completely agree. I have no problem with your faith in this event either, you are free to believe in and have faith in whatever you choose. It's when this faith reaches into the realm of the natural and scientific in search of support and justification that I have a problem with it. It's counterproductive to those who profess faith. Whether or not there is any physical evidence of the event or even if it's physically possible should be irrelevent to your faith in the event as the work of God. Searching for this proof would seem to me to be an admission of a weakness in your faith, an need to have some form of evidence or justification for your faith beyond the words of the bible.

Or even a flood? Surely god could have managed the survival of Noah + family + breeding pairs of all animal kinds without the cheap gopher wood props? Couldn't god just have snapped its finger-substitutes and annihilated (literally) all the people and animals it didn't want, without all this 'world-wide flood' grandstanding?

Your belief requires a deceptive God. You are a Heretic. That actually ca be explained. It's called harmonics. There's some ideas as to producing weapons that produce a frequency to destroy things at their molecular levels. It takes faith for you to believe in all of that as it has no evidence. If the Ark occurred, there would be massive genetic bottlenecks in every species. Therefore God would need to increase genetic diversity and therefore HIDE the event of the Ark. Again, your belief requires God to be deceptive. Do you like believing in a Liar God?","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","03:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","161"

I can only conclude Archie is an Ed Wood fan. As I've pointed out in other posts, the ""can you prove it won't happen"" is a logical fallacy, usually referred to as ""proving a negative."" (Though I myself refer to it as the Ed Wood fallacy: ""Grave-robbers from outer space... can you prove it didn't happen??"") The possibility of something happening needs to be demonstrated concretely in order to be debated. Events which have not been demonstrated to have a possibility of happening can't be rationally considered.","MrWriteLA","260636","On another forum, to another poster... http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...&postcount=186 There, I was referring to the supposed, unspecified harm that ""might happen"" from allowing same-sex marriages, but the point applies to Archie's nonsense as well.

Unless God doesn't know everything, he foresaw all this occurring. He treated innocent children and animals as 'sinful life,' drowning them in order to cleanse the Earth. Fantastic abuse of power! Only a drama queen would have gone to all those lengths instead of conjuring up a simple cleansed Earth without ANY original inhabitants. Then no bugger would have been any the wiser and mankind could have started again. But of course God just has to prove that He's better than Satan so many times.
