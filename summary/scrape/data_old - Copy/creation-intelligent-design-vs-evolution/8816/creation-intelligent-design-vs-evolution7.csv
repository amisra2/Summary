Just by looking at the volcanic activity produced by plate movement of only a few cm/year today, we can surmise that movement of thousands of miles in a few years would turn surface of the earth molten again. Heat is a pervasive problem to the idea of a young earth and a global flood as proposed by creationists. Joe Meert, a geologist at the University of Florida, gives some numbers on the effects of cramming 4.5 billion years of radioactive decay into 6000 years if it were possible that such radio activity was faster before and during the flood. See Were Adam and Eve Toast? . Dr. Meert also briefly discusses the effects of tectonic movement in his article, Can Creationists Fit the Flood in a Geologic Framework? . And I mentioned above that the release of latent heat from the condensation of enough water to flood the earth would be enough to boil the ocean. (I suspect that Archangel is unaware the the condensation of vapor into rain produces heat). Another problem posed by the reality of tectonics to creationists is that the sea floor would all be of the same age. It isn't. Or that sea mounts produced at tectonic boundaries could not have eroded flat on top as they did when they were closer to the boundary. Older sea floors generally sink when they cool.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","11:56 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","92"

I notice that none of these wild conjectures are even remotely supported by the Bible. You'd think that earthquakes every few seconds that make the Winter 2004 quake look like a kid in comparison, along with what you mentioned would've at least gotten a few sentences of mention in the Bible - quite a bigger disaster than the flood.

All of those events crushed Natural Laws we must live by. But those things still happened because our God isn't bound by the physical laws He created in order to cause balance in his creation.
