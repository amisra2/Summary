"04-16-2007","8816",8,"Archangel","258903","Jesus walked on Water, God parted the red Sea and Jesus raised people from the dead and healed the lame. All of those events crushed Natural Laws we must live by. But those things still happened because our God isn't bound by the physical laws He created in order to cause balance in his creation. And I didn't scorn you Pandion, I simply showed remorse and sadness for the rude awakening you're in for when you realize how shallow your natural intellect is in comparison to the Spiritual laws you have no idea even exist and therefore never consider in your assumptions and equations.","pandion","258928","But those are all claims based on a book of mythology that was written for the purpose of convincing people like you of the truth of some religion in spite of reality. Now you are changing horses. Before it was I who was readily submitting to unchangeable laws. That implies that you do not readily submit to them - even that you can violate them if you wish. Now it seems that you too readily submit to natural laws - except of course, when you wish to introduce magic that violates those laws, and, in effect, make them capricious and unreliable because they can be cast aside on a whim by some magical, invisible being. There is no point in even trying to learn science since it can all be cast aside without reason. You have a weird theology. So your god is a liar is what you are saying? Your god makes natural laws and them violates them on a whim, meaning that there is no base of belief or knowledge. Anything goes at any time. You have an attitude of scorn towards everyone. You insult your betters all the time. You continually whine about how others scorn you and then you respond with hubris and scorn, laced with name calling and insult. Since it's OK with you for your god to violate natural law on any whim, it must also be OK for you to violate how Jesus told you you should act towards others. Like most christians, you're a hypocrite.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","11:41 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","106"

Apparently Archangel believes his god is a deceitful little scumbag who ""created the universe to look old"". His god seems to be a deceptive liar that can't be trusted to even tell the truth.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","11:54 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","107"

Apparently, nature doesn't reflect the glory of god as some religionists have told me. According to Archy, it reflects his deceit. Knowledge of god, a cruel and vindictive god at that, can only be gained from a book of mostly mythology.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","12:07 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","108"

Knowledge of god, a cruel and vindictive god at that, can only be gained from a book of mostly mythology.","ShadowPikachu","258938","Yep, according to Arch, it does seem to reflect deceit and lies. I find it very sad that he believes in such a god (and that there are others that follow his religion of fear).","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","12:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","109"

Guess all of that is true as well - they have just as much evidence as the stories of the Bible.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","01:34 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","110"
"04-16-2007","8816",8,"pandion","258928","Like most christians, you're a hypocrite.","obvious_child","258961","Perhaps since he believes that he can be absolved of a life of hypocracy, deciet, dishonesty and other bad traits in a second of actual repetence he feels that he has no incentive to follow anything in Christanity and thus is free to disregard all of the teachings of Jesus as he pleases.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","02:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","111"
"04-16-2007","8816",8,"Archangel","258964","To each of you I will say that I welcome the day when we will find out who among us are the hypocrites, liars and deceivers. I sincerely wish you blessings in that regard.","obvious_child","258967","Are you trying to make everyone believe that Christanity derives its beliefs from fear of Hell? I know full well that you will wake up after dying and realize you wasted your life worshipping a false God, luckily for you though, the true God is how shall I say it....absent for the time being so not believing is not going to hurt you. I, unlike you, don't rely upon it when I'm losing a argument because my belief is not fear based, but truth based.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","02:58 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","113"

You display your lack of understanding and unwillingness to learn over and over again, and you continue to be suckered in by christian frauds and hoaxes time after time, and when your errors are pointed out to you all you can do is respond by whining, ""you're gonna be sorry."" No one here has lied to you or tried to deceive you, so none are hypocrites. If anyone here were a liar or a hypocrite, you would certainly fall for what they have to say since you have demonstrated that you do so, time and time again. Tell us how bumblebees can't fly or about those Ica stones again. You are a great embarrassment to real Christianity.","literal-flood-scientifically-possible","04:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","116"
