"01-05-2009","12047",5,"CashBurnRate","335082","The coelacanth, according to fossil records, and according to evolutionists, allegedly went extinct millions and millions of years ago. Until they were found alive. As if this should be any surprise. The theory of evolution mindset once again contradicts observable science.","Ignatius","339074","Experience contradicts previously accepted experience. That's how science evolves. Science.

The fossil coelacanths are small, freshwater fish. The ones living today are large, deep ocean fish. The whole creationist position on coelacanths is based on the misconception that these fish have not evolved. But they are greatly evolved from their ancestors.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","08:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","63"

However, when you're delusional enough to deny radioactivity when you're getting your power from a nuclear reactor, you're pretty much beyond help. Or when you deny fluid dynamics yet wash your dishes in your sink, you're in an oblivion of hopelessness. I'd say most of the diehard YECs are hopeless and aren't worth talking to outside of mocking. Remember Arch said that high levels of carbon dioxide was the reason insects go so big during the carboniferous and that oxygen had no role. Really.

You constantly call everyone who disagrees with you soulless, lost, atheist who you implicitly threaten will burn in hell. And they are not misinterpretation. You clearly STILL have not rejected either of those arguments. And you called math atheism. Really. How does anyone go about fixing that kind of attitude? LOL. Few errors? You really think you made only a few errors? Care to cite how many times you have been right in anything ? Hell, you called a society with classes, a dictatorship and small scale capitalism ""Communist."" Really. Aww, you like me. Anything I pointed out, you automatically assume is a lie.

Please show me where he called math atheism Unless you can refute each and every one of his 7,000+ posts, you can't make that assertion. 5. Show me where he indicated that everything you say is a lie. 6. The thread was not about probability. Shall we go back and see where you thought that you can get only 6 five's with infinite dice? 7. Please show me where he said that. Dishonesty is what absolutely destroys societies. When people are dishonest, they destroy trust with their fellow man.

At least you're a consistent liar though. And you have spent time in my brain right? You are God who knows my inner thoughts, right? You make these absurd claims and can't even see that it only reveals your delusions. Another blatant lie which is based on not only misrepresenting what I said, but on raping it. So much so that only a mentally ill person could read that into it. So I demand that you quote the post of me saying math = Atheism of be branded the liar we all know you are anyway. Exactly, fewer than you with many more in depth and varied debates. All anyone need do is spend time going through our posts, here are mine: 4Forums.com Political Debates and Polls - Search Results And here are yours: 4Forums.com Political Debates and Polls - Search Results I welcome a comparison to your juvenile and outrageously dishonest debating style. Many more than you! Really? Quote them! Show us once again to support your libelous claim or be proven to be the liar I'm calling you. You are so twisted, you think that because you make some outrageous claim it must be true. Whether it is factual or not never enters your mind at all. That's the definition of mentally ill little child. I assume nothing child. I know it's a lie because I'm the one being misrepresented by your perversions of what was discussed. And that will be proven either way, because if you quote the posts where you have said what I meant in them, people will see clearly how twisted your reasoning is. I don't care where you go little child. You will ultimately reveal how massively dishonest your interpretation of what was said is. Again liar, prove it by quoting the post where I said anything remotely like this. I say that because this time you've even stumped me as I have no idea what you're referring to at all. So quote the post in order to prove how totally corrupted your mind is.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","06:23 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","74"
