And you wont find a political scientist alive that doesn't apply the practical, historical definition that the USSR was communist in reality and represented communism throughout its history. That is the historical reality which you aren't smart enough to grasp, or you just refuse to accept. So wallow in your denial. Don't you get it that I don't care how wrong you choose to be? Just stop claiming that this is something only I believe because I have posted links to hundreds of thousands of links, all which confirm that history has recorded that the USSR was a Communist regime which was based on the principles of Marx's communist manifesto. I never said it was based on all of them, nor did I say that it was a perfect reflection of the manifesto. But it was based on it and the USSR was a communist political system according to every historical reference available. Now you can troll and snipe like the juvenile delinquent that you are from here till doomsday. I'm through defending a long accepted and proven historical point which you're obviously too thick to comprehend.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","10:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","123"

Except that the application of Communism had relatively little similar with what Marx wrote. But it's damn clear you haven't the faintest clue of what Marx wrote. LOL. The problem with historical 'reality' is that has no meaning. In trying to argue that the so called Communist nations practiced Communism, Communism comes to mean Capitalism, Dictatorships and Class Society with collectivization, atheism yet Christanity (and Buddhism) at the same time, wishy washy free trade yet adamantly hateful to the free trade world, and unequal application of resources while praising egalitarianism. The historical application has virtually no meaning as those who claimed themselves to be Communists have tried a great many methods and ideas. The historical ""reality"" is a contradictions of nonsense. If we use what is historical we have Communism representing two sides of the spectrum. Hence why it is fundamentally useless as a term for anything more then what Jo Bennet described: a villianization of the West's enemies. Since the historical reality of Communism has included full scale democracy, capitalism and unequal application of resources as well as class societies, by your own definition, the West is Communist. There is a reason all of us have been hitting you on this asinine argument. You are attempting to use a term that has effectively no meaning. If you do not look at it through Marx, Communism can mean whatever you want it to mean. Incorrect. You have refused to state otherwise. You have refused over 20 times to simply admit that the USSR failed Marx's basic criteria. Therefore since you are so damn adamant about simply NOT answering, there's not much to conclude other then you do believe the true insane. And all you have posted is that people use the villanization term of Communism. Nothing you've posted actually shows that the USSR was Communist. Clearly, you have ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE what Communism is. How could the USSR have reflected the Manifesto when it failed virtually everything outside of collectivization that Marx wrote about in the Manifesto? How could the USSR be even a passable reflection when it had classes, communism, trade with the West, elites, unequal allocation of resources and no power in the hands of the worker? The USSR FAILED HORRIBLY to even come close to what Marx wrote. Your massive, unending ignorance to even understand the most basic parts of Communism is why you keep trying to argue the idiotic argument that a class society, run by dictators, trading with the west and practicing capitalism is Communist. You wonder why we all think you're stupid? It ain't hard to figure out. By whom? Everyone here agrees with me. And all of your posts don't use Marx's definition but the definition that means nothing.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","01:13 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","124"

The USSR never claimed to practice communism - rather the ideals of communism were always said to be an inspiration and a goal. Not even Soviet ""communists"" claimed that their nation was truly communistic. There has been at least one example of true communism. An itinerant preacher and his followers in Israel about 2000 years ago lived true communism. For a few years after his death, his followers around the Mediterranean were also communists. But after a short time, the communism faded, leaving only small communities that apply his teachings. In fact, the teachings were greatly distorted by later followers like Calvin, who concentrated on wealth rather than sacrifice and good work.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","10:15 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","125"

But here's the rub pandion, it failed miserably in practical application. If you do a study of the early church, specifically in the book of Acts, you will find that the churches around the region which didn't follow the practices of the church in Jerusalem, (and were never excoriated or criticized for that, mind you,) but they took regular offerings and sent the proceeds to support the Jerusalem church which was bankrupt and in great need of support just to keep it alive. This is why the practice was ended. It never lasted past the first 20 years of the first century apostolic church, much less having been affected or impacted by the teachings of Calvin, a 16th century lawyer/protestant reformer. But if you want to be technical regarding Calvin, one of his great desires was to get the church back to living according to the original apostolic church which was closest to Jesus prior to His crucifixion. So to imply that Calvin would have opposed early church practices and traditions isn't fair to what he represented at all.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","11:23 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","127"
