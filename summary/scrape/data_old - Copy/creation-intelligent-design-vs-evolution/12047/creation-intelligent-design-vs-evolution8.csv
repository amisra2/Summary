That was squarely refuted. You claimed that I lied about your views on Communism. The link provides otherwise and all you had to say was for people to look at it. You provided no argument as to why I was wrong. TQ busted your chops over Co2 which you have still yet to reply to. I posted numerous statements by you accusing people who disagreed with you of being souless, heathens and atheists. You still have yet to disprove that you called math atheism. Did you not call the USSR Communist? Care to show me in the Communist Manifesto where Marx said that Communism was a class society run by dictatorship with capitalism? You won't because you know that you are wrong. I've asked you that at least 15 times. You have failed every single time yet still say the USSR, a class society run by a dictatorship with capitalism was Communist. Because you do. I have gone over this several times. Furthermore TQ pointed out that when you replied to his post criticizing you on math by calling his views wrong on the basis of his atheistic world view, you called math atheism. All you have against those arguments is personal attacks. No evidence you didn't do what we accused you of. I have cited the link in previous posts and cited your direct response to criticism of your inability to do math. Simply insulting me doesn't change the fact you have no argument against my statement that you consider math to be atheism. Why is that everyone is laughing at you then? Why is that others are pointing out that you are wrong?","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","10:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","110"

Now I invite everyone to click on it and peruse the sites and see if they all don't include the USSR, the Eastern Bloc, China, Cuba and many others, but what is key is that they all attribute their political philosophies to being born out of the Marxist blueprint of communism. So maybe they don't perfectly reflect what Marx intended, which I have never denied at all because it is irrelevant to the larger reality and truth of the matter.

There is no comparison at all between these belief systems, or their practical applications. Why is that? Because one is founded by God Himself while the other was founded by a very flawed man who created just one of many political philosophies throughout history. All of which submit to and crumble under the judgement of the everlasting God of all Creation. But it should also be noted that there are many denominations which don't agree with me specifically on all scriptural doctrines which are NOT salvation issues, and they are saved none the less. Just as every communist state which has ever existed and was founded (loosely, though some may be to various degrees) upon the principles of Marx's Communist Manifesto, are still forms of communism none the less.

Incorrect usage of the term has been going on for decades despite the actual writings of Marx. Good job on stating ""born out of"" instead of saying actually. Really meaning they missed the target by several thousand miles. The only society that has come close to Communism is the pygmies in Africa. Every one of your nations cited has failed the most basic criteria to be called Communist. I still you still adamantly refuse to answer my question. You won't answer because you know you are dead XXX wrong and you never admit you ever screw up. Incorrect. You kept claiming they were Communist despite failing the most basic tests. Again, Care to show me in the Communist Manifesto where Marx said that Communism was a class society run by dictatorship with capitalism? Just because a country's regime's ideology is alleged to have come from Marx doesn't make them Communist. Xiaoping's PRC called itself Communist despite breaking directly with the very explicit statements by Marx NOT to engage in free trade with the rest of the world. Only a fool like you would call a country Communist when it ignores extremely explicit statements about what not to do by the founder of the ideology. You'd call a country capitalist even if everything was state controlled and centrally planned with no personal ownership. What facts? How about the fact that the USSR was a dictatorship, had classes and practiced Capitalism? Oh wait. You won't address that because: 1) You have absolutely no understanding of Communism 2) You rely entirely upon superficial statements 3) You've NEVER heard of Marx I'm waiting for veiled threats of Hell for merely disagreeing with you.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","04:23 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","114"

You get to called any country Communist because they say they are independent of just how well they stick to Marx. ""Loosely"" means ""anything"" and that is pretty obvious about how you define Communism. To arch, if a country calls itself Communist, it is independent of the key, core and vital criteria set forth by Marx. I guess by that logic, Arch thinks that North Korea is a democracy merely because it calls itself one.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","04:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","115"

The Collapse of Communism Editor: Lee Edwards ISBN: 978-0-8179-9812-7 Pub Date: November 10, 1999 Product Format: Paper Availability: In stock. Price: $18.95 Qty: Ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and eight years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, experts continue to debate one of the most important political questions of the twentieth centurywhy did Communism collapse so suddenly? A comprehensive and often unexpected answer is provided in this unique volume of essays by the world's leading authorities on Communism. Presidential adviser Zbignew Brzezinski discusses the critical role of policymakers like Ronald Reagan, Mikhail Gorbachev, and John Paul II in the demise of Communism. Richard Pipes and Martin Malia debate the importance of history and ideology. Robert Conquest analyzes the deleterious impact of the Stalin years, and Michael Novak delineates the missing element of faith in Communism. Andrzej Brzeski exposes the fatal flaws of Communist economics; Brian Crozier discusses why there was a cold war. Paul Hollander concludes with a consideration of who in the academy was rightand wrongabout Communism. These insightful essays suggest that a wide range of forcespolitical, economic, strategic, and religiousalong with the indispensable role of the principled statesman and the brave dissident, brought about the collapse of Communism. The Collapse of Communism I INTRODUCTION Printer-friendly version of section Collapse of Communism, the disintegration of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) between 1989 and 1991. II CAUSES OF THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNISM Printer-friendly version of section The basic causes were economic stagnation, the rise of nationalist resistance to the ideology of communism, attempts to increase democracy, and changes in the international political environment. These factors were all interlinked and the Soviet leadership failed to devise a sequence of reforms that would enable it to sustain its rule. By the 1980s the Communist regimes were all coming close to economic stagnation, in part caused by enormous defence expenditures. The Star Wars initiative proposed by the United States president Ronald Reagan in 1983 threatened to provoke an arms race that would impose even greater burdens on people who had experienced improvements in their standard of living and wanted more. There had been earlier attempts in Eastern Europe at reforming the Communist system from within (1956 in Hungary (see Hungarian Revolution) and 1968 in Czechoslovakia (see Prague Spring), but these had been repressed by Soviet leaders who feared losing the buffer zone between the Soviet Union and the West that had been established after World War II. What had changed by the mid-1980s was the emergence in 1985 of Mikhail Gorbachev, representing a new political generation, as general-secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).

The tyranny and atrocities of Nazi Germany have been justly condemned by world opinion for over 50 years. But it is only recently that Communist despotism has begun to receive remotely similar attention. It would be a great tragedy if Communism disappeared from the earth without leaving behind an indelible memory of its horrors. Communism was not essentially about espionage, or power politics, or irreligion. Rather it was a grand theoretical synthesis of totalitarianism... a theory which millions of people experienced as the practice of murder and slavery. The roots of Communism lie squarely in the works of the philosopher Karl Marx. But at the same time, as we shall see, the tradition of Czarist absolutism also became an important source of Communist inspiration. The first exhibit to open explores the Marxist and Czarist origins of the Communist movement. Museum of Communism Chew on these and if you need more of an education I'll supply it to you. In other words, spew your garbage to the world at large and stop preaching your historical lies to me.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","05:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","116"
