They're merely the same order. Scientists concluded the entire order had died out, because they only saw fossil examples from millions of years ago. They realised they were wrong when a live example of a species within that order was found.

"12-05-2008","12047",3,"Huntard","335248","At your service: Comparison I could've just circled the whole thing, but this makes it clearer. Plus it's overall body shape is ""fatter"" I don't believe that piece of text was from the National Geographic, if so, please provide the issue it was written in. Further, the Nat Geo is NOT a scientific peer-reviewed journal, it's a popular science magazine. And as I've said time and again, the Coelacanth of today IS very different from the ones in the fossil record. If not on the morphological level, then absolutely on the genetic level. What is your evidence they didn't do this? Remember, today's Coelacanth is different. Of course they didn't see it walk, it's a different genus altogether. He's not talking about the fossil Coelacanth, he's talking about the modern version of it. And you can assert all you want, without evidence, they're just that, assertions.","Archangel","335458","Your comparative link didn't work. But here is your diagram and photo together. Note the B specimen in the fossil diagram and imagine it with flesh. More obfuscation and denials of the facts. Especially since I did post the account from Fricke which the article was based upon, here: The Fish That Time Forgot - Sidebar - MSN Encarta Notice at the top of the page it say's this: In a 1988 National Geographic article, Fricke reported what they saw. And Nat Geo reports on the reported facts as considered by the source, so they are assuming nothing which hasn't been reported within the community. To disregard their version is to reject what the original purveyors of the info believed. And it is obvious that Fricke considered his ability to view the living coelacanth to be the same as looking at a hundreds of million year old living fossil. Ask yourself this simple question huntard; why would Fricke have made this statement regarding the fish he was viewing live, compared to the ancient specimen if they weren't the same fish as far as he was concerned? I confess I'm sorry we never saw a coelacanth walk on its fins. Professor Smith himself nicknamed the coelacanth Old Fourlegs in the belief that the creature actually did walk upon the seafloor like a seal on its flippers. Alas, that does not seem to be the case. For every myth we dispelled, however, I'm certain there are a dozen fascinating discoveries still to be made. In short, we have just begun to know the coelacanth. Source: Fricke, Hans. Coelacanths, The Fish That Time Forgot. National Geographic, June 1988. NO, it isn't different. Nor was it considered to be different when the original discovery was made. That is my point. Evos are now trying to claim a difference where none was seen or claimed originally. Wrong again. Fricke was specifically comparing the new fish to the alleged habits and capabilities of the fossilized assumptions because that was what he wanted to confirm. That it had intermediary traits as claimed by Professor Smith himself who nicknamed the coelacanth Old Fourlegs in the belief that the creature actually did walk upon the seafloor like a seal on its flippers. But I have posted evidence. And even your evidence which I reposted proves I am right. And if you can read the link from Encarta, or this link: The Fossil Record and not see the obvious belief and understanding ""at the time"" by the involved scientists then it is you who is denying the facts. The ancient coelacanths, from the first time they appeared in the fossil record were virtually identical to the living ones we find at the present day, extending all the way back through the geologic record past the Paleogene age of the mammals (63 million years), before the Cretaceous and Jurassic age of the dinosaurs (100 million through 225 million years ago), before the Triassic age of early mammals (200 million through 250 million years ago), before the Permian age of early reptiles (250 million through 300 million years ago), before the Carboniferous age (300 million through 370 million years ago), all the way back to the Devonian era, 400 million years ago in the fossil record, according to the time scale of the evolutionists. And this: Just how different is this fish from the ancient coelacanth? On pp.832 of the National Geographic article of 1988, there is a study of the comparative anatomy between the living and ancient coelacanth with this caption next to pictures of each one. They state: ""LIKE CARBON COPIES, the tail of a live coelacanth and a 140-million year-old fossil virtually match."" They go on to report: ""Few creatures have endured such an immense span of time with so little change as the coelacanth. The cut-away drawing of a present-day specimen seems almost identical with the 140-million year-old fossil found in a quarry in southern West Germany. It is that extraordinary lack of change that enabled Professor J.L.B. Smith in Grahamstown to identify the coelacanth caught in South Africa in 1938 from a rough sketch, although he had never seen a live specimen.""(30)","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","10:31 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","33"

But it's not. What are you talking about? Just a little knowledge makes that quite clear. Huntards link was to P.Z. Myers' blog. P.Z. is an associate professor of biology at the University of Minnesota. He used that particular illustration to point out how different fossil coelacanths were from modern species. And yet, you think that they are identical if we only imagine image B) with flesh. The image actually comes from a book by Jenny Clack, and her point is the same as that of P.Z. Myers. Fossil coelacanths are significantly different from modern species. I would recommend Jenny Clack's book (Clack, Jennifer A. 2002. Gaining Ground: The Origin and Evolution of Tetrapods . Indiana University Press, Bloomington. 369 p.) except that it is quite technical. It requires an in depth knowledge of the physiology and anatomy of fish and early tetrapods, as well as knowledge of vertebrate anatomy and physiology, genetics, paleontology, and geology. I must admit that it was a difficult read for me (bones, bones, so many bones), and I am an evolutionary biologist (genetics, ecology, and wild life biology). I suspect that it may be a bit over your head, since you lack the education to understand. I don't. His point was that fossil species were not identical to modern species. You disagree. I don't. Should that have been a question? Was Peeling specifically referring to Rhabdoderma elegans ? I gave you the link that specified the length of R. elegans as 3.7 inches long. Did I screw up the arithmetic? I can't find where Peeling said that the ""original"" was 15 inches long. What original? Was he discussing an average coelacanth rather than Rhabdoderma elegans ? Actually, only creationists claim that it was ""almost identical"" to any fossil species. The intent of that quote is to dupe the ignorant. Only creationists would equate ""so little change"" with ""identical."" There are obvious and significant differences between any example of a fossil species of coelacanth and either of the two extant species. That is not to say that the modern species are not recognizable as coelacanths. But, in spite of the fact that J.L.B. Smith didn't mention size, modern species are much larger than any fossil species. They are also deep water fish. All fossil coelacanths (without exception) were shallow water fish. So please explain what you point is. Why is it so important to you that fossil coelacanths are the distant offspring of much larger offspring? How is it meaningful? How does your argument that modern coelacanths evolved from much smaller and significantly different ancestors somehow an argument against evolution and actually an argument in favor of the magical version proffered by muslim and christian creationists?","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","01:35 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","41"

What's Old Is New: 12 Living Fossils | Wired Science from Wired.com Here is how the article describes these creatures. ""Known as living fossils, they lasted for millions of years with barely a change, even as their relatives went extinct or took different paths across the tree of life."" And further down it refers to the coelacanth which is describes this way: ""Coelacanth vanished from the fossil record 410 million years ago and then one was caught in 1938 off the coast of South Africa. A second species was discovered in Indonesian waters in 1999."" Now notice that according to ACTUAL SCIENTISTS AND EXPERTS, they clarify, after referring to the it vanishing from the fossil record 410 million years ago, that ONE WAS FOUND, AND THEN A SECOND SPECIES ALSO WAS DISCOVERED IN 1999. Unlike you, they make no attempt to separate the modern coelacanth from the fossil, which is kind of obvious I guess since they are referring to it and the others as living fossils. I will accept the opinions of scientists over apologists. Here's a video of it: YouTube - Indonesian coelacanth And just 2 questions for Pandion, how can you prove that the 400 million year old coelacanths were shallow water fish? And are they born fully grown, or come in one size only? If not, then why do you assume that the fossil record is of a fully grown mature fish and not of a newly born fish?
