Until they were found alive. left an abundant fossil record from the Devonian to the end of the Cretaceous period, at which point they apparently suffered a nearly complete extinction. Coelacanth - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia As if this should be any surprise. The theory of evolution mindset once again contradicts observable science. left an abundant fossil record from the Devonian to the end of the Cretaceous period, at which point they apparently suffered a nearly complete extinction.","Huntard","335086","There is just one thing however. The coelacanths found are different from those in the fossil record. Further, ALL evidence pointed to them being extinct, until we found other evidence, and we changed it. And, to top it off, the article says NEARLY extinct, not COMPLETELY. Although, this article was of course written after the coelocanths were re-discovered. Of course, this has absolutely nothing to do with the theory of evolution, which explains the mechanisms responsible for the change of allele frequencies in populations over time.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","05:26 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","101"

The living species today closely resemble the fossils. The prediction was made based on the mindset that everything evolved from a common ancestor over billions of years. Furthermore, it was based upon the fossil record, which is supposedly shows how everything evolved.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","05:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","56"

Fossil Coelocanth: Fossil Coelocanth No, it was based upon the fact we hadn't seen one, yet there were fossils of them. Then when we did see the descendants of the fossils and it got changed, that's how science works, when better data is found, the theories are changed.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","05:42 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","69"

There was a gap in the fossil record, scientists looked it at it, and using the theory of evolution mindset, automatically assumed that it went extinct millions and millions of years ago. But of course, it was absolutely wrong. A prediction was made based on the theory of evolution and it was absolutely wrong. Simple.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","05:46 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","84"

No. They looked at the fossil records, and found fossils up until a certain point in time. After that no fossils were found, and nobody had seen the thing. Now, what conclusion can we draw from this? Or are you suggesting dinosaurs are also still alive, even though nobody's seen them? It has nothing to do with the mindset, and everything to do with the available data. Once better data became available, it was changed. Yes, but we had no way to tell until we found them again, now had we? The prediction was NOT made based on the theory of evolution, but on the fact that there were fossils up until a certain time, then there were no more fossils and nobody had seen the thing. What's so hard to understand here?","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","05:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","164"

I know animals evolve, and this leads to morphological change.
