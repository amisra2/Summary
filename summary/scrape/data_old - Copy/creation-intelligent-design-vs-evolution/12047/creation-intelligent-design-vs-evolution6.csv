You are God who knows my inner thoughts, right? You make these absurd claims and can't even see that it only reveals your delusions. Another blatant lie which is based on not only misrepresenting what I said, but on raping it. So much so that only a mentally ill person could read that into it. So I demand that you quote the post of me saying math = Atheism of be branded the liar we all know you are anyway. Exactly, fewer than you with many more in depth and varied debates. Many more than you! Really? Quote them! Show us once again to support your libelous claim or be proven to be the liar I'm calling you. You are so twisted, you think that because you make some outrageous claim it must be true. Whether it is factual or not never enters your mind at all. That's the definition of mentally ill little child. I assume nothing child. I know it's a lie because I'm the one being misrepresented by your perversions of what was discussed. And that will be proven either way, because if you quote the posts where you have said what I meant in them, people will see clearly how twisted your reasoning is. Again liar, prove it by quoting the post where I said anything remotely like this. I say that because this time you've even stumped me as I have no idea what you're referring to at all. So quote the post in order to prove how totally corrupted your mind is.","obvious_child","339240","While I realize you're just going to abandon this thread after I post the links showing you are in fact guilty (and a liar) http://www.4forums.com/political/rel...ist#post328768 http://www.4forums.com/political/edu...ist#post328983 http://www.4forums.com/political/rel...ist#post329002 http://www.4forums.com/political/cur...ist#post329605 http://www.4forums.com/political/ele...ist#post330255 http://www.4forums.com/political/cre...ist#post333678 http://www.4forums.com/political/lia...ist#post314819 http://www.4forums.com/political/ent...ist#post314355 http://www.4forums.com/political/rel...tml#post312039 That's just a sample of your 7,000 posts. Virtually any time you start losing, you throw out the insults and veiled threats of hell. Cite the link where you retracted your claims about gigantism in the Carboniferous era. Oh wait. You can't, because you never did so . Thus I am correct (as usual). I did. And then you made a huge scene and made the admin delete it. You said that TQ and I had a false atheist world view in replies to why we think you're an ##### based on your inability to do math. We criticized you DIRECTLY on your inability to do basic addition and subtraction. Directly responding to those criticism by calling our world views atheistic classifies math, which we criticized you on, as atheist in your mind. All you did in response was just flame me rather then deal with the logic. TQ and I say you're dumb because you can't do math. You respond saying we're wrong because of our misguided atheist world view. Huh. Explain to me how you did not call math part of the atheist world view when you called us wrong in response to criticism on your inability to do math. Try again.

Too bad Marx, who founded the notion thinks you are dead wrong. Pray tell, can you point out where Marx in any of his writing said class societies with dictatorships running capitalism were Communist? Lol. You really didn't think I'd go and post search findings did you? You rejected radioactive dating as invalid, inaccurate and useless. The problems it that modern radioactivity is the foundation for nuclear energy.

You don't think anything you say is a lie, despite you being factually wrong on just about everything. To lie requires one to know what they say is false. You don't know better. And you don't want to. Thus it's a waste of time to actually try to hold intelligent discussions with you.

Here's the shocker for you, those are the quotes she's pointing to in order to support her claims against me. So when you click on any link and it comes up with anything said by me, no matter how far away from the point child is asserting it's supposed to make, rest assured, that is childs attempt to prove that what she say's about me is true. Now you see why I have correctly said she is irrational and delusional and why debating with someone like her is truly a waste of time since she doesn't read what someone actually say's; she reads into the posts to get what she wants to think that person say's. And this is the definition of irrational and delusional. So read from her original post http://www.4forums.com/political/report.php?p=339187 where she makes these accusations about me, then scroll down to the links and click on those links, and the posts which come up are her evidence against me, here's the accusation post: http://www.4forums.com/political/cre...tml#post339240 . I realize there is a huge disconnect regarding what she said and the evidence of what she posted regarding what I said, but don't think that's a problem seeing the correct post. It just reveals absolutely how twisted and disturbed little childs perspective is in her accusations against me. So don't feel guilty for missing the evidence she posted. Because you're seeing the evidence she posted. Thus, her disconnect with reality which she has proven with her own evidence, which I have been saying is obvious for a long time now. But thankfully and finally, the obvious child herself posted all the info needed to prove it.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","08:50 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","81"

These links don't support your claims at all, but all expose you for the liar and delusional misinterpreter of what I and others say in most all of your debates, because when you're losing you lash out like a child and attack the person rather than debate the issues. Here is your claim above which I challenged you to prove. Really? And these are the links you quoted in order to prove your point? Now show me specifically where I was condemning people to hell in one of these links? Because I didn't. And point out where I said they were soulless, lost, or called anyone an atheist who isn't actually an atheist? There's another lie and you just proved it yourself with the links you posted. You also proved that you are deranged and delusional to read that into those responses which were made in the heat of debate. Also, if what you say is true, why didn't you post any links showing that at all? Could it be because you're delusional, irrational and are imagining things in your head that aren't real? Then why didn't you post the link to that post? So what are you correct about other than making a stupid claim that you can't support? You're asking me why I never retracted a statement you never showed I even said. Is that a rational thought process child? Yet you didn't post any links to my inability to do math, and neither did you post the link of me calling math atheistic. WHY NOT LIAR? Here's your chance to support your claims yet all you do is post links that are irrelevant to your slanderous claims while posting nothing to support your lies!!! And only in your twisted mind are you proving something. I stand by these responses regarding communism in these debates and challenge any rational observers to disagree with my take on what Soviet Communism represented in reality, rather than little childs rewritten history of what he thinks it represented. AS DID THE COMPLETE WORLD THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE 70 YEARS THAT THE COLD WAR EXISTED. SORRY YOU'RE NOT SMART ENOUGH TO GRASP THAT HISTORICAL FACT. I actually logged off tonight and prayed you would, just to reveal and prove how full of it you are. And you came through with flying colors. As usual you have corrupted the simplest statement. I challenged, NOW READ SLOWLY LITTLE CHILD, RADIOMETRIC DATING AS VALID. And the question I would ask a rational person is, what does rejecting radiometric dating and all of its problems with interpretation have to do with rejecting Nuclear Energy? The answer from a rational and sane person would be ""none"", yet you link them together as if I've argued against radioactivity existing. Only a delusional person would jump off the cliff as you have and expose their mental instability as you have with this line of attack. ou made against me and the evidence you supported which don't prove your allegations at all, in even the slightest way. This post has proven who is factually wrong between us little child, and in your case, completely irrational and mentally unbalanced also, for you to post the links you posted in order to support the claims you made proves that you and simone suffer from the same malady.

Only fools consider class societies run by dictatorships with capitalism to be Communism. Communism =/= Totalitarianism. The USSR was Totalitarian with some ideas of collectivization of the masses. The lack of worker democracy, classless society and total communal ownership without a material reward system removes it from being validly considered Communist. The Communist Manifesto says you're wrong. What do you have to say? Heaven forbid actually looking at what Marx said! No, we just called it that was easier. Proper usage of political science terms are rarely used in US politics. And you are again redefining words to suit your argument. Actual Communists didn't call the USSR Communist. Explain to me ( you won't because you can't and you don't understand ), how class societies ruled by a few people with small scale capitalism is Communist. LOL. Only you would think that. Everything?

Your rejection of radiometric dating rejects radioactivity. The issue is either you are too stupid or too ignorant to realize how if you reject radiometric dating, you pull the foundation out from nuclear power. Again, this is why we think you're an #####. You fail to understand the most basics relationships between sciences that support evolution and every day life. Read above. Those links deal with radioactivity and nuclear power.

As both rely upon the study of radioactivity and radiometric dating makes very few assumptions that fall outside of radioactivity, you are rejecting radioactivity. As you reject that, you reject atomic power which entirely relies upon the same assumptions.
