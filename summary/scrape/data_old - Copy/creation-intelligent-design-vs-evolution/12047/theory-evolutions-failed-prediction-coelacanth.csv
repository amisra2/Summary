You know, the same reason we say the dodo is extinct, or the mammoth, or the sabre-tooth tiger, or... you get the idea. The real question is: since they aren't extinct, why did the fossil record end so many millions of years ago? To which the answer is beautifully straightforward: the coelacanths in the fossil record were shallow water fish, and thus their remains are relatively prolific and accessible. The ones that survive today are deep-sea dwellers, from whence we are rarely afforded the opportunity to recover fossils. Don't forget, coelacanth is an order in taxonomic terms, not a species.

Then when we did see the descendants of the fossils and it got changed, that's how science works, when better data is found, the theories are changed.","Archangel","335238","First of all, let's compare the ""B"" specimen in this fossil link to the modern specimen and point out any significant difference to me. Secondly, shortly after the discovery was made of the living fish, but before the fix was in to excuse the massive assumptions evolutionists previously made regarding what the fossil represented, Nat Geo reported the truth about the claims evolutions had made prior to finding this fish alive and well and basically unchanged after an alleged hundreds of millions of years. One example that amply demonstrates the accuracy of evolutionary dating and sequencing of fossil fish, or any fossil for that matter, would be the story of the coelacanth. This is a genuine fish story. For many years evolutionists had assured us that the coelacanth, a member of the crossopterygian family and a supposed link to amphibians, had most definitely been extinct for at least sixty million years, at least according to their precise methods of dating and their exact analysis of the indisputable evidence of the fossil record. No doubt about it, the coelacanth died out millennia ago along with the dinosaurs, at least until a living coelacanth was dredged up off the coast of Africa in 1938. Since then hundreds of live coelacanths have been found. In the June, 1988 National Geographic Magazine they featured numerous pictures of the coelacanth swimming around in the ocean depths, where they differ very little from the ones found entombed in the fossil layers, thus providing no evidence of any kind of evolution occurring for the coelacanth, despite the fact that the evolutionists say these fish have been swimming around for at least four hundred million years. The ancient coelacanths, from the first time they appeared in the fossil record were virtually identical to the living ones we find at the present day, extending all the way back through the geologic record past the Paleogene age of the mammals (63 million years), before the Cretaceous and Jurassic age of the dinosaurs (100 million through 225 million years ago), before the Triassic age of early mammals (200 million through 250 million years ago), before the Permian age of early reptiles (250 million through 300 million years ago), before the Carboniferous age (300 million through 370 million years ago), all the way back to the Devonian era, 400 million years ago in the fossil record, according to the time scale of the evolutionists. Initially it couldn't be admitted that a living coelacanth had appeared that was identical to a species that evolutionists had calmly assured us was extinct for so many millions of years. Thus when a live example of this extinct fish had been found, J.L.B. Smith, a chemist and ichthyologist at Rhodes University in Grahamstown University, South Africa, pronounced it an entirely new genus and species, differentfrom any coelacanth previously recorded as fossils. Smith gave the living coelacanth a very scientific name, Latimeria chalumnae, after Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer who discovered the fish, and the mouth of the Chalumna River where it was captured. Just how different is this fish from the ancient coelacanth? On pp.832 of the National Geographic article of 1988, there is a study of the comparative anatomy between the living and ancient coelacanth with this caption next to pictures of each one. They state: ""LIKE CARBON COPIES, the tail of a live coelacanth and a 140-million year-old fossil virtually match."" They go on to report: ""Few creatures have endured such an immense span of time with so little change as the coelacanth. The cut-away drawing of a present-day specimen seems almost identical with the 140-million year-old fossil found in a quarry in southern West Germany. It is that extraordinary lack of change that enabled Professor J.L.B. Smith in Grahamstown to identify the coelacanth caught in South Africa in 1938 from a rough sketch, although he had never seen a live specimen.""(30) Throughout the entire history of vertebrate animals the coelacanth appears, differing very little in structure, showing absolutely no signs of evolving from one species and/or changing into any other kind of species through the supposed millions of years of it's existence. It would seem that giving the newly discovered living coelacanth the status of an entirely new species and genus was simply to hide their embarrassment while they were scrambling to come up with some kind of an explanation as to why they had been so sure that it had been extinct for sixty million years. I think there's something fishy here in what the evolutionists have been trying to tell us. This is true of virtually all fossils found, whether sharks or sand-dollars, they show no signs of evolutionary change to or from another distinct species. Evolutionists had long speculated that the crossopterygians (the class of fish including the coelacanth), because they had bony elements in their fins, may have had the ability to walk while in the water on the floor of the sea, which somehow led to the development of legs to walk on the land. This scenario was put to rest when the authors wrote in the National Geographic article: ""Our films settled another question that has intrigued scientists: whether the coelacanth can walk on its lobed fins. Though we observed several individuals resting with their fins braced against the sea bottom, we never saw any of them walk, and it appears the fish is unable to do so.""(31) It should be noted that the coelacanth does not lay eggs like most fish, amphibians and reptiles do, but gives live birth. Thus as evolutionists had tried to connect the coelacanth with some unknown link between amphibians and fish, this would put it in a rather dubious position as an intermediary candidate. The red-tailed sun perch off the northwest coast of the United States also gives live birth after nine months, two thirds of all existing sharks give birth to live, wriggling, little, sharks, some lizards give live birth, so a supposed evolutionary sequence demonstrating how fish, amphibians and reptiles lay eggs while only mammals and marsupials give live birth would be in serious trouble. The Fossil Record Here's the relevant point of exposing how evolutionists dealt with defining the Coelacanth. Before evolutionists knew that living examples of this fish existed, they never even hesitated in taking the observable physical features it exhibited and thought nothing of creating a completely inaccurate and totally fictional biography of that fish's evolutionary journey. They not only claimed that it crawled on the Sea bottom which proved it was an intermediary fish, but they made assumptions based on the fact that it birthed its young live rather than being an egg layer. Here is Hans Fricke's own story regarding the investigation into the coelacanths natural habitat which Nat Geo's story is based upon. And notice the last paragraph in the story.

Note the B specimen in the fossil diagram and imagine it with flesh. More obfuscation and denials of the facts. Especially since I did post the account from Fricke which the article was based upon, here: The Fish That Time Forgot - Sidebar - MSN Encarta Notice at the top of the page it say's this: In a 1988 National Geographic article, Fricke reported what they saw. And Nat Geo reports on the reported facts as considered by the source, so they are assuming nothing which hasn't been reported within the community. To disregard their version is to reject what the original purveyors of the info believed. And it is obvious that Fricke considered his ability to view the living coelacanth to be the same as looking at a hundreds of million year old living fossil. Ask yourself this simple question huntard; why would Fricke have made this statement regarding the fish he was viewing live, compared to the ancient specimen if they weren't the same fish as far as he was concerned? I confess I'm sorry we never saw a coelacanth walk on its fins. Professor Smith himself nicknamed the coelacanth Old Fourlegs in the belief that the creature actually did walk upon the seafloor like a seal on its flippers. Alas, that does not seem to be the case. For every myth we dispelled, however, I'm certain there are a dozen fascinating discoveries still to be made. In short, we have just begun to know the coelacanth. Source: Fricke, Hans. Coelacanths, The Fish That Time Forgot. National Geographic, June 1988. NO, it isn't different. Nor was it considered to be different when the original discovery was made. That is my point. Evos are now trying to claim a difference where none was seen or claimed originally. Wrong again. Fricke was specifically comparing the new fish to the alleged habits and capabilities of the fossilized assumptions because that was what he wanted to confirm. That it had intermediary traits as claimed by Professor Smith himself who nicknamed the coelacanth Old Fourlegs in the belief that the creature actually did walk upon the seafloor like a seal on its flippers. But I have posted evidence. And even your evidence which I reposted proves I am right. And if you can read the link from Encarta, or this link: The Fossil Record and not see the obvious belief and understanding ""at the time"" by the involved scientists then it is you who is denying the facts. The ancient coelacanths, from the first time they appeared in the fossil record were virtually identical to the living ones we find at the present day, extending all the way back through the geologic record past the Paleogene age of the mammals (63 million years), before the Cretaceous and Jurassic age of the dinosaurs (100 million through 225 million years ago), before the Triassic age of early mammals (200 million through 250 million years ago), before the Permian age of early reptiles (250 million through 300 million years ago), before the Carboniferous age (300 million through 370 million years ago), all the way back to the Devonian era, 400 million years ago in the fossil record, according to the time scale of the evolutionists. And this: Just how different is this fish from the ancient coelacanth? On pp.832 of the National Geographic article of 1988, there is a study of the comparative anatomy between the living and ancient coelacanth with this caption next to pictures of each one. They state: ""LIKE CARBON COPIES, the tail of a live coelacanth and a 140-million year-old fossil virtually match."" They go on to report: ""Few creatures have endured such an immense span of time with so little change as the coelacanth. The cut-away drawing of a present-day specimen seems almost identical with the 140-million year-old fossil found in a quarry in southern West Germany. It is that extraordinary lack of change that enabled Professor J.L.B.

But it's not. What are you talking about? Just a little knowledge makes that quite clear. Huntards link was to P.Z. Myers' blog. P.Z. is an associate professor of biology at the University of Minnesota. He used that particular illustration to point out how different fossil coelacanths were from modern species. And yet, you think that they are identical if we only imagine image B) with flesh. The image actually comes from a book by Jenny Clack, and her point is the same as that of P.Z. Myers. Fossil coelacanths are significantly different from modern species. I would recommend Jenny Clack's book (Clack, Jennifer A. 2002. Gaining Ground: The Origin and Evolution of Tetrapods . Indiana University Press, Bloomington. 369 p.) except that it is quite technical. It requires an in depth knowledge of the physiology and anatomy of fish and early tetrapods, as well as knowledge of vertebrate anatomy and physiology, genetics, paleontology, and geology. I must admit that it was a difficult read for me (bones, bones, so many bones), and I am an evolutionary biologist (genetics, ecology, and wild life biology). I suspect that it may be a bit over your head, since you lack the education to understand. I don't. His point was that fossil species were not identical to modern species. You disagree. I don't. Should that have been a question? Was Peeling specifically referring to Rhabdoderma elegans ? I gave you the link that specified the length of R. elegans as 3.7 inches long. Did I screw up the arithmetic? I can't find where Peeling said that the ""original"" was 15 inches long. What original? Was he discussing an average coelacanth rather than Rhabdoderma elegans ? Actually, only creationists claim that it was ""almost identical"" to any fossil species. The intent of that quote is to dupe the ignorant. Only creationists would equate ""so little change"" with ""identical."" There are obvious and significant differences between any example of a fossil species of coelacanth and either of the two extant species. That is not to say that the modern species are not recognizable as coelacanths. But, in spite of the fact that J.L.B. Smith didn't mention size, modern species are much larger than any fossil species. They are also deep water fish. All fossil coelacanths (without exception) were shallow water fish. So please explain what you point is. Why is it so important to you that fossil coelacanths are the distant offspring of much larger offspring? How is it meaningful?

What is incredible is that you are so deluded that you think I'm willfully ignorant because I have the good sense not to blindly follow a man made science which is based on absolutely flawed and fictitious info, conclusions and assumptions. It is beyond you, one who thinks I am willfully ignorant, that if the numbers used that make up the equation are wrong to begin with, then you have NO HOPE AT ALL OF EVER COMING UP WITH THE RIGHT SOLUTION!!! This is a principle I learned in the first grade. That the outcome of any problem is only as good as the info it is based upon. Yet you allegedly intelligent evo mooks just merrily go along never asking truly valid questions or question the contradictions as you blindly follow this pseudo science like a religion. And then you attempt to condemn and ridicule anyone who rejects it because its defenders responds to their questions just as you have attacked my intelligence since they can't answer the questions forwarded. I mean, the lunacy of you and pandion calling me too ignorant to understand your answers when I obviously have a sufficient grasp of the subject to see the holes and ask the questions which you are unable to answer. Yet in your small mind, it is I who am ignorant. Here's the bottom line tq; these two belief systems are at total and complete odds with each other. They can't both be partially right. So one of us is being completely snowed in having faith in what we believe. My faith is in the Creator of all that is, and your faith lies in the creature, that his humanist interpretation is right which means that we came about randomly through various mutations which occurred by chance with no intelligent design at all. Those are the only two possible outcomes when all is said and done. So speak of arrogance and willful ignorance, it is you who is when you, as just a matter of fact, declare the other side wrong without ever seeing through our eyes as we have surely seen through yours before deciding that evolution is not only seriously flawed science, but false at every assumption and conclusion it is based upon. As I said above, if you must preface each and every conclusion with excuses and justifications in order to explain why the info you input to come to those conclusions doesn't quite add up as you intended them to, then your so called science is nothing more than junk science, and you are the ignorant one for believing it based on such flawed outcomes. Here's why you are as willfully ignorant as you accuse me of being. You insist that the fossil layers found within thousands of feet of diverse strata were laid gradually over hundreds of millions of years. All of your evo conclusions are based on that premise. But if as I say, the great deluge of Noah's flood happened as the bible states, then that accounts for the world wide layers of strata in which fish, mammals, birds and every other type of creatures are found side by side and on top of each other in only a 40 DAY period. You ignore that little fact as you attempt to categorize these deposits by time since one creature was found 6 inches or a foot below or above the one preceding it. It is beyond you to consider that IF THE FLOOD OCCURRED, due to the massive event which was taking place, that the bottom creature died just days before the one we found above it. That possibility would never enter your mind since you consider that possibility a myth. And what do you base that on??? You assume Radiometric Dating methods rely on assuming the rates of Decay has been a constant, that they start with no, or known daughter components, or was it an Isolated system with no external loss/addition of parent or daughter components?

"12-07-2008","12047",4,"Archangel","335666","And tell me this tq! of what value in the end is the word of an actual scientist of a false and pseudo science? The answer is NONE AT ALL. So when truth is the ultimate goal, we are all on equal footing you sanctimonious putz. And how am I running away when I have responded to all the tripe you have posted? What is incredible is that you are so deluded that you think I'm willfully ignorant because I have the good sense not to blindly follow a man made science which is based on absolutely flawed and fictitious info, conclusions and assumptions. It is beyond you, one who thinks I am willfully ignorant, that if the numbers used that make up the equation are wrong to begin with, then you have NO HOPE AT ALL OF EVER COMING UP WITH THE RIGHT SOLUTION!!! This is a principle I learned in the first grade. That the outcome of any problem is only as good as the info it is based upon. Yet you allegedly intelligent evo mooks just merrily go along never asking truly valid questions or question the contradictions as you blindly follow this pseudo science like a religion. And then you attempt to condemn and ridicule anyone who rejects it because its defenders responds to their questions just as you have attacked my intelligence since they can't answer the questions forwarded. I mean, the lunacy of you and pandion calling me too ignorant to understand your answers when I obviously have a sufficient grasp of the subject to see the holes and ask the questions which you are unable to answer. Yet in your small mind, it is I who am ignorant. Here's the bottom line tq; these two belief systems are at total and complete odds with each other. They can't both be partially right. So one of us is being completely snowed in having faith in what we believe. My faith is in the Creator of all that is, and your faith lies in the creature, that his humanist interpretation is right which means that we came about randomly through various mutations which occurred by chance with no intelligent design at all. Those are the only two possible outcomes when all is said and done. So speak of arrogance and willful ignorance, it is you who is when you, as just a matter of fact, declare the other side wrong without ever seeing through our eyes as we have surely seen through yours before deciding that evolution is not only seriously flawed science, but false at every assumption and conclusion it is based upon. As I said above, if you must preface each and every conclusion with excuses and justifications in order to explain why the info you input to come to those conclusions doesn't quite add up as you intended them to, then your so called science is nothing more than junk science, and you are the ignorant one for believing it based on such flawed outcomes. Here's why you are as willfully ignorant as you accuse me of being. You insist that the fossil layers found within thousands of feet of diverse strata were laid gradually over hundreds of millions of years. All of your evo conclusions are based on that premise. But if as I say, the great deluge of Noah's flood happened as the bible states, then that accounts for the world wide layers of strata in which fish, mammals, birds and every other type of creatures are found side by side and on top of each other in only a 40 DAY period. You ignore that little fact as you attempt to categorize these deposits by time since one creature was found 6 inches or a foot below or above the one preceding it. It is beyond you to consider that IF THE FLOOD OCCURRED, due to the massive event which was taking place, that the bottom creature died just days before the one we found above it. That possibility would never enter your mind since you consider that possibility a myth. And what do you base that on??? You assume Radiometric Dating methods rely on assuming the rates of Decay has been a constant, that they start with no, or known daughter components, or was it an Isolated system with no external loss/addition of parent or daughter components? This is very unlikely over millions of years. Yet geologists use a standardized formula's for dating in which it is impossible to treat each rock or fossil as an individual based on its actual time, depth and location it was found in. Do you think it's smart to have a one size fits all formula for each element as they apply to different objects from different times, depths and conditions they are found at and within? Really tq? And you're calling me too ignorant to comprehend the issues for asking these questions? I submit that it is you arm chair scientists who are the ignorant ones for not asking them. So my friend,(figuratively speaking of course) it appears we are at a stand off in how we interpret the same available evidence. Do you see now why I'm not impressed with any of you evos since none of you have the where with all to even question the problems within your so called science/religion?","Huntard","335687","Exactly, which is why we don't listen to creationists. Perhaps you answered all of T.Q.'s posts, you didn't answer alot of others refuting your claims, or, if you did respond, did so by basically just saying ""nuh-uh"" and then went about your business. You just showed yourself to be willfully ignorant, because, in fact, the theory of evolution is supported by ALL the evidence. Fortunately for us, the number ARE correct. Yes, and since the data being fed here is empirical evidence, the outcome must also be accurate, and guess what, it is. Actyally, any good scientists questions everything all the time. I certainly don't, I just tell you where you went wrong, in the hopes you will actually look into it more, and learn the truth. Further, we answered your questions. You haven't asked any question we are unable to answer. And, sorry to say this, but you don't know enough of this. How long have you studied coelacanths? Why the do you think you know more about them then the people who actually did study them extensively? See above. Now, there's nothing wrong with being ignorant, I'm ignorant on a lot of things, but I don't go around saying my solutions to those problems are better then the solutions given by those who do know about these things. True. They aren't. Only one is right, the one supported by all the evidencde. True again. Wrong. First of all, his is not faith, as it is based on evidence, faith being a believe in spite of evidence. Second, it didn't happen with jst random mutations, natural selection is a very important part of it as well. And Humanists have nothing to do with this. Wrong, there are more then two possibilities. But all except one are not supported by the evidencde. Wrong. Evolution is supported by ALL the evidence. Again you show you are ignorant on the subject, please learn about it. And it is arrogant to claim you know better then people who have studied all this for their entire lives when you know nothing of it whatsoever. Well, since we don't have to do that, it seems the problem is solved. Wrong, there have been numerous experiments, all of which point to evolution happening. The fact it is ignored is because there is so much evidence suggesting the flood never happened, it would be foolish to include it in any theory. Here are 100 categories of evidence against the flood: EvC Forum: 100 Categories of Evidence Against Noah?s Flood All of these need to be accounted for to be able to allow the flood to have happened. And just to address the point ou made here, if the flood caused the fossils, they are absolutely sorted wrong, they would have to be mixed in with eachother, instead they are sorted exactly as evolutionary theory predicted, simpler life forms at the bottom, more complex life forms at the top. That's because there is so much evidencde against the flood, it would be foolish to consider it. On the massive amount of evidencde that points to it never having happened. In fact, all radiometric dating methods agree with eachother with such accuracy, that they can't be anything but right. Here's an article on radiometric dating, I suggest you read it and learn from it. Radiometric Dating and the Geological Time Scale No. which is why that isn't done. Well, since you are wrong about that formula thingy, I'd say yes, you are ignorant of it. We did ask them, and it turns out our questions were based on false assumptions, so we now know, and don't ask them anymore. No. you fit the evidence to your conclusion, we fit the conclusion to the evidence. We allready asked, them, they were based on false assumptions, we learned from our mistakes, and now understand why they were false.

Here's the shocker for you, those are the quotes she's pointing to in order to support her claims against me. So when you click on any link and it comes up with anything said by me, no matter how far away from the point child is asserting it's supposed to make, rest assured, that is childs attempt to prove that what she say's about me is true. Now you see why I have correctly said she is irrational and delusional and why debating with someone like her is truly a waste of time since she doesn't read what someone actually say's; she reads into the posts to get what she wants to think that person say's. And this is the definition of irrational and delusional. So read from her original post http://www.4forums.com/political/report.php?p=339187 where she makes these accusations about me, then scroll down to the links and click on those links, and the posts which come up are her evidence against me, here's the accusation post: http://www.4forums.com/political/cre...tml#post339240 . I realize there is a huge disconnect regarding what she said and the evidence of what she posted regarding what I said, but don't think that's a problem seeing the correct post. It just reveals absolutely how twisted and disturbed little childs perspective is in her accusations against me. So don't feel guilty for missing the evidence she posted.

"01-08-2009","12047",7,"Archangel","339431","Here are two links which truly expose your demented character child. Remember yesterday when I said I'm obviously not perfect and have made mistakes on this forum? This is one of those true examples of that in the first link. And notice how in post #24 I admitted it openly, here: http://www.4forums.com/political/cre...tml#post308961 And I invite all observers to follow the thread to see how I am attacked and excoriated by multiple posters even though I did the only right thing and admitted my error. And even now, almost a year later this philosophical coward continues to use this against me as a weapon to attack me rather than to have graciously accepted my confession of making a mistake by misinterpreting what type of creatures we were discussing. Actually, it's you and tq who are still lying about me in order to condemn what I represent. To imply that anything I said equates math to equaling atheism is just so infantile and irrational as to belie reason which once again confirms that you are truly delusional in your hatred for anything I say which opposes your shallow world view. And here is where tq piped in to support your irrational delusions. Here's what he contributed yesterday: Here's the rub which both of fail to acknowledge or appreciate. Archie isn't alone in rejecting the accuracy or the reliability of radiometric dating methods which it is accurately referred to. Only people who have no concept of what the science is refers to it as radioactive dating. That's point# 1. #2, to reject sciences ability to interpret the results of radiometric dating methods in no way reflects on ones ability to trust or rely on the quality of the science which makes Nuclear power a safe and efficient form of energy. I have debated in favor of Nuclear energy on this forum as fervently as I have debated against the reliability of radiometric dating like millions of others do and I've posted numerous links to evidence which opposes it. So to make this disagreement just about me as if I alone reject this unreliable process for dating objects is to once again show how dishonest you both are to use tunnel vision in categorizing me as a sole arbiter of these opinions. Not at all. I reject the interpretations made based on rates of decay which are impossible to absolutely verify regarding the actual conditions of whatever is being tested which may very well vary due to when and in what conditions they were originally deposited. No absolute variables have been determined by science which can verify. Even the proponents use that fact as an explanation when they get unrealistic results. They also have preconceived notions before any testing is ever done as to what the outcome should be and they continue to run tests until they reflect the desired outcome. This doesn't describe science so much as attempting to create a scenario to confirm their preconceived notions, no matter how shoddy the science is. This statement perfectly defines the irrationality of your attempts to equate a widely held rejection of radiometric dating with not appreciating the value of and safety which Nuclear Energy represents today, or the principles upon which it is based. The bolded statement reflects you ignorance because the application of the two processes seek totally different results for the same radioactive material. One uses fissionable material to create energy while the other attempts to apply rates of decay in order to date objects. For you to claim they are comparable processes just reveals your ignorance, not mine.","T.Q","339443","You did no such thing! If you're going to lie, at least don't point out the evidence which shows you lied!

And in the post you just linked, you tried to cover up your ignorance by saying ""oh, I thought we were talking about giant dinosaurs, not giant arthropods, because O_C spelt is as ""athropods"""". You then follow it up with a link to a flickr page which shows pictures of arthropods! So, in that thread you: 1) went off on a rant against O_C without reading or understanding the opening post (this is what you're claiming above); and 2) Argued that CO2 is an oxidizer (which you have yet to address or recant, despite what you said above) Jesus Archie, get real.

Nothing here deserves a response as I proved you wrong above. You can repeat your drivel for ever but that wont change the fact that even the USSR never denied that the Communist Party was the ruling party for 70 years, and that according to every Country and pundit on Earth the USSR was a Communist Country. This is where it gets really funny folks: You're right, it's radiometric dating. I've worked 60 hours so far since Sunday and I'd had about 5 hours sleep when I wrote that. The correct term was eluding me. As for ""not being alone"", no, you have the full backing of other people who have no idea what they're talking about. Or, as stated above, people who are working long hours on little sleep. Yes, it does, as they are based on the same scientific principles. If one doesn't work, neither does the other. Which matters how? Millions? No, you've posted numerous links to twaddle which have been explained to you numerous times. Who says you're the only one? You are the most vocal on this board however. This has been explained to you numerous times. Huh? Mind typing that again in English? No, that would be you. And do you have proof to support your accusation that all scientists, researchers and lab techs are liars? No, they continue to run tests if they determine it wasn't done right the first time. Much the same thing you would do I imagine. That's a concise enough definition of creation ""science"" I suppose. You do realize that no one is saying you oppose nuclear energy, right? Nope, he's just not getting it folks... Fun as this is (it's not...), I think I'll step out here on Archie as well.

In the first post you showed that your representations of what I represent is delusional, and now you want to affirm it with additional evidence. That is the definition of being dense. Here is what her original slanderous accusation against me was yesterday: Point made! You even admit that I never directly condemn anyone, yet you insist on accusing me of condemning people. To a rational mind it will explain my position perfectly and will also show why I'm condemned for sharing my faith by this hypocrite. And I invite all observers to follow the thread to see how I am attacked and excoriated by multiple posters even though I did the only right thing and admitted my error. And even now, almost a year later this philosophical coward continues to use this against me as a weapon to attack me rather than to have graciously accepted my confession of making a mistake by misinterpreting what type of creatures we were discussing. Actually, it's you and tq who are still lying about me in order to condemn what I represent. To imply that anything I said equates math to equaling atheism is just so infantile and irrational as to belie reason which once again confirms that you are truly delusional in your hatred for anything I say which opposes your shallow world view. Nothing here deserves a response as I proved you wrong above. You can repeat your drivel for ever but that wont change the fact that even the USSR never denied that the Communist Party was the ruling party for 70 years, and that according to every Country and pundit on Earth the USSR was a Communist Country. I have debated in favor of Nuclear energy on this forum as fervently as I have debated against the reliability of radiometric dating like millions of others do, and I've posted numerous links to evidence which opposes it. So to make this disagreement just about me as if I alone reject this unreliable process for dating objects is to once again show how dishonest you both are to use tunnel vision in categorizing me as a sole arbiter of these opinions. Not at all. I reject the interpretations made based on rates of decay which are impossible to absolutely verify regarding the actual conditions of whatever is being tested which may very well vary due to when and in what conditions they were originally deposited. They also have preconceived notions before any testing is ever done as to what the outcome should be and they continue to run tests until they reflect the desired outcome. This doesn't describe science so much as attempting to create a scenario to confirm their preconceived notions, no matter how shoddy the science is This statement perfectly defines the irrationality of your attempts to equate a widely held rejection of radiometric dating with not appreciating the value of and safety which Nuclear Energy represents today, or the principles upon which it is based. I did, with your help by showing how you misrepresent everything I say in the very quotes you posted.","obvious_child","339481","Wow. You are dense. You called me a girl. I then called you dense.

You do in fact call everyone who disagrees with you soulless, lost, atheist who you implicitly threaten will burn in hell. Incorrect. You never explicit do so. You have many examples however of threats of implicit hell. ""You'll learn how wrong you are at the end and you'll regret it"" is a threat of Hell whether you want to admit it or not. in fact I'm just one of the few people who have pointed out that you rely or used to rely heavily upon threats. One of the quotes I provided has you futily trying to argue that you weren't making a threat but a promise (as if you understand the difference). You mean us, who think you use threats like you change underwear? You are not rational. See T.Q's post for why you are, as always wrong. You never retracted your statement. Never. Which proves your statement about me being a liar to be false, which would make you wrong. But your constantly wrongness is not news to anyone. Let's see. I gave a through logical explanation for why you argued that math = atheism [b]and all you can respond to is with flaming. No response to the logic. No response to what you actually said. You just flame. Sad. Personal attacks are all you have. You responded to a post criticizing you for your inability to do math. You then attack back by citing an atheist world view. Like I said, you won't respond, you can't respond and you don't have the brains to respond. We're lying, but you can't refute anything we say? lol. Care to cite these pundits explaining what Communism is? You really have no idea who Marx was do you? And your entire argument is appeal to authority. Fallacies and lies. All you have. Explain to me how a class society run by dictators with capitalism is Communism. lol. That's again due to your massive ignorance in understanding how radioactivity actually works. You reject the dating based on the same principles yet use the power based on the same principles. It makes no sense, but no one ever said your belief systems were consistent or even sensical. You don't understand the most basics of relationships. The same principles that underly nuclear power. Oh wait. You're not going to deal with that because 1) you don't understand the principles and 2) you have no idea what you are talking about. If only you had proof of this. And your arguments against dating are often reliant upon non-cogentic samples, more proof you have absolutely no understanding of the topics. Lol. HOW?

Price: $18.95 Qty: Ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and eight years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, experts continue to debate one of the most important political questions of the twentieth centurywhy did Communism collapse so suddenly? A comprehensive and often unexpected answer is provided in this unique volume of essays by the world's leading authorities on Communism. Presidential adviser Zbignew Brzezinski discusses the critical role of policymakers like Ronald Reagan, Mikhail Gorbachev, and John Paul II in the demise of Communism. Richard Pipes and Martin Malia debate the importance of history and ideology. Robert Conquest analyzes the deleterious impact of the Stalin years, and Michael Novak delineates the missing element of faith in Communism. Andrzej Brzeski exposes the fatal flaws of Communist economics; Brian Crozier discusses why there was a cold war. Paul Hollander concludes with a consideration of who in the academy was rightand wrongabout Communism. These insightful essays suggest that a wide range of forcespolitical, economic, strategic, and religiousalong with the indispensable role of the principled statesman and the brave dissident, brought about the collapse of Communism. The Collapse of Communism I INTRODUCTION Printer-friendly version of section Collapse of Communism, the disintegration of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) between 1989 and 1991. II CAUSES OF THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNISM Printer-friendly version of section The basic causes were economic stagnation, the rise of nationalist resistance to the ideology of communism, attempts to increase democracy, and changes in the international political environment. These factors were all interlinked and the Soviet leadership failed to devise a sequence of reforms that would enable it to sustain its rule. By the 1980s the Communist regimes were all coming close to economic stagnation, in part caused by enormous defence expenditures. The Star Wars initiative proposed by the United States president Ronald Reagan in 1983 threatened to provoke an arms race that would impose even greater burdens on people who had experienced improvements in their standard of living and wanted more. There had been earlier attempts in Eastern Europe at reforming the Communist system from within (1956 in Hungary (see Hungarian Revolution) and 1968 in Czechoslovakia (see Prague Spring), but these had been repressed by Soviet leaders who feared losing the buffer zone between the Soviet Union and the West that had been established after World War II. What had changed by the mid-1980s was the emergence in 1985 of Mikhail Gorbachev, representing a new political generation, as general-secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).

The tyranny and atrocities of Nazi Germany have been justly condemned by world opinion for over 50 years. But it is only recently that Communist despotism has begun to receive remotely similar attention. It would be a great tragedy if Communism disappeared from the earth without leaving behind an indelible memory of its horrors. Communism was not essentially about espionage, or power politics, or irreligion. Rather it was a grand theoretical synthesis of totalitarianism... a theory which millions of people experienced as the practice of murder and slavery. The roots of Communism lie squarely in the works of the philosopher Karl Marx. But at the same time, as we shall see, the tradition of Czarist absolutism also became an important source of Communist inspiration. The first exhibit to open explores the Marxist and Czarist origins of the Communist movement. Museum of Communism Chew on these and if you need more of an education I'll supply it to you.

Except that the application of Communism had relatively little similar with what Marx wrote. But it's damn clear you haven't the faintest clue of what Marx wrote. LOL. The problem with historical 'reality' is that has no meaning. In trying to argue that the so called Communist nations practiced Communism, Communism comes to mean Capitalism, Dictatorships and Class Society with collectivization, atheism yet Christanity (and Buddhism) at the same time, wishy washy free trade yet adamantly hateful to the free trade world, and unequal application of resources while praising egalitarianism. The historical application has virtually no meaning as those who claimed themselves to be Communists have tried a great many methods and ideas. The historical ""reality"" is a contradictions of nonsense. If we use what is historical we have Communism representing two sides of the spectrum. Hence why it is fundamentally useless as a term for anything more then what Jo Bennet described: a villianization of the West's enemies. Since the historical reality of Communism has included full scale democracy, capitalism and unequal application of resources as well as class societies, by your own definition, the West is Communist. There is a reason all of us have been hitting you on this asinine argument. You are attempting to use a term that has effectively no meaning. If you do not look at it through Marx, Communism can mean whatever you want it to mean. Incorrect. You have refused to state otherwise. You have refused over 20 times to simply admit that the USSR failed Marx's basic criteria. Therefore since you are so damn adamant about simply NOT answering, there's not much to conclude other then you do believe the true insane. And all you have posted is that people use the villanization term of Communism. Nothing you've posted actually shows that the USSR was Communist. Clearly, you have ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE what Communism is. How could the USSR have reflected the Manifesto when it failed virtually everything outside of collectivization that Marx wrote about in the Manifesto? How could the USSR be even a passable reflection when it had classes, communism, trade with the West, elites, unequal allocation of resources and no power in the hands of the worker? The USSR FAILED HORRIBLY to even come close to what Marx wrote. Your massive, unending ignorance to even understand the most basic parts of Communism is why you keep trying to argue the idiotic argument that a class society, run by dictators, trading with the west and practicing capitalism is Communist. You wonder why we all think you're stupid? It ain't hard to figure out. By whom? Everyone here agrees with me. And all of your posts don't use Marx's definition but the definition that means nothing.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","01:13 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","124"

The USSR never claimed to practice communism - rather the ideals of communism were always said to be an inspiration and a goal. Not even Soviet ""communists"" claimed that their nation was truly communistic. There has been at least one example of true communism. An itinerant preacher and his followers in Israel about 2000 years ago lived true communism. For a few years after his death, his followers around the Mediterranean were also communists. But after a short time, the communism faded, leaving only small communities that apply his teachings.

But here's the rub pandion, it failed miserably in practical application. If you do a study of the early church, specifically in the book of Acts, you will find that the churches around the region which didn't follow the practices of the church in Jerusalem, (and were never excoriated or criticized for that, mind you,) but they took regular offerings and sent the proceeds to support the Jerusalem church which was bankrupt and in great need of support just to keep it alive. This is why the practice was ended. It never lasted past the first 20 years of the first century apostolic church, much less having been affected or impacted by the teachings of Calvin, a 16th century lawyer/protestant reformer. But if you want to be technical regarding Calvin, one of his great desires was to get the church back to living according to the original apostolic church which was closest to Jesus prior to His crucifixion. So to imply that Calvin would have opposed early church practices and traditions isn't fair to what he represented at all.","theory-evolutions-failed-prediction-coelacanth","11:23 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","127"
