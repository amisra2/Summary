"10-10-2011","15750",1,"None","None","None","AMD4EVER","440497","I have come across several different types of creationist debates in the past as it pertains to how we can explain the fossils and other evidence that many different types of creatures existed prior to humans. Explanation #1: The argument that I think makes the most sense is that God created the heavens, galaxy, earth, and some life. This life evolved and eventually became everything that we see around us today with the exception of humans which the Bible clearly stated God created man. I don't really believe this is how things went but I don't see a lot of fault in it either. Explanation #2: Nothing existed before man. Dinosaur bones have never been found. We either just think we found them because we don't understand what we are looking at or there is some worldwide conspiracy trying to make us think things used to live before man and the devil is laughing at all of us for being such fools. This argument is so idiotic that I just brush anyone who thinks like this off as incapable of reason. Explanation #3: This is a new one to me. One of my co-workers said he believes that God created all plants and animals to exist at the exact same time. He says that if we try to use carbon dating to disprove this that carbon dating has been proven to be flawed. He says that if we try to base the age of certain species on the depth of their remains location in the earth's crust he debated that we're just looking at a small fraction of the earth's crust and will surely find dino bones somewhere that will show the existed as recently as a few thousand years ago and human bones somewhere to show they existed hundreds of millions of years ago. I find debating #3 to be difficult because he is actually correct in both of his statements. Carbon dating isn't a 100% slam dunk and we have only looked through so much of the crust and are basing our conclusions on just a small piece of the puzzle. I'm certain that his idea is completely flawed but am trying to figure out how to prove it. Anyone care to offer up some ideas?","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","04:09 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1"

This sounds like an amazing book except for one part. I don't consider evolution or creationism to have all the answers. Evolution's biggest blank spot is the missing link. We don't get to see macro evolution and have trouble finding evidence of it. In the video for the book the author says something along the lines of, ""See everything that changed in the past millennia and imagine what could happen over a million years."" What happened in the past millennia is that we've seen a great deal of micro evolution but no macro evolution. We can imagine what it would be like if macro evolution occurred but we can't prove that it occurs. This is one of the trouble spots I run into with evolution. The other trouble spot is that we know it takes a certain amount of a species in order to maintain it's existence. So how does a species exist after macro evolution occurs and there is just 1 or maybe a handful of them? They would be forced to interbreed for many generations to get their population up which genetically doesn't seem to work out so well. Maybe I'm showing my own ignorance here as this may all have been answered in this book but just by the video I get the sense that we are left with good evidence that macro evolution happens but need to leave it at that. Is this the case?","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","04:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","3"

Not 100% accurate could mean many things, it could mean you don't know the exact second or nano second that some event occurred, because there are geological shifts and geology itself is an improving science you cannot be 100% sure how and when something was deposited; but they both work. Further I don't believe carbon dating can work for most fossils, it's more of an archeology thing due to how fast C14 decays. It's like saying a driver can't stay perfectly in the middle of the lane nor know exactly when the light turns red or green so we can't really drive... yes we can, within acceptable tolerances. Now the primary problem, lack of disproof is not proof; it's an argument from ignorance to say otherwise. i.e. even if we were in the 12th century our inability to prove that plants existed independently of animals at one point does not mean they never did and it certainly does not mean they were both created at the same instant by a mystical being.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","11:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","5"

Is this the case?","pandion","440528","At least you looked. While the science of biological evolution does not claim to have all of the answers, the mythology of creationism does. You see, evolutionary biology is science by which people attempt to explain natural events with natural explanations. This is a process wherein unexplained observations are made. Data is then gathered and an hypothesis the may explain the observations is formulated. Then a prediction that must necessarily follow from the hypothesis, if it is correct, is made. An experiment if designed to test the prediction. If the experiment supports the hypothesis, then it may, depending on how stringent the experiment was, be considered a scientific theory. Evolution is a scientific theory that has been test to the extent that no educated or intelligent person doubts that it is correct. Modern debates about evolution are not about whether it happens, but about the mechanisms that cause it to happen. On the other hand, the mythology of creationism is the equivalent of throwing ones hands in the air and giving up. In this case, we attribute what we do not know and do not understand to super-naturalism. It has been that way since people invented gods to explain the unknown. Unfortunately, there are many books of writing that are believed to be written by a magical being. Of course, they were not directly written by this magical being. They were ""inspired"". And even though they all contain errors of fact and history, they are still accepted as without error. One of these books, the mythology of bronze age, nomadic herdsmen has become the basis of western religion (Judaism and christianity). Many people believe that this mythology is the literal truth as a mater of blind faith. As a result, they reject observations of reality that are in conflict with their belief in mythology. Actually, that's your problem since that the ""missing link"" is an archaic, religious idea that has no meaning in evolutionary biology. What are you talking about? Nonsense. Then you can explain 36 species of felidae (cat) and 42 species of canidae (dog) that ""micro-evolved"" in a few years after the flood and somehow spread themselves around the world. And then there are the birds -- there are 731 species in 311 genera in 74 families in North America, all in the class aves. At what point do you postulate a ""pair"" on the ark and the hyper-evolution of everything in a lower classification. But the numbers of bird species in North America are paltry when compared to those in South America and Africa. Unique species on those continents number in the thousands. Then consider Europe (comparable to NA) and Asia. How may thousands of birds were on the ark and how were their varied diets supplied (seed eaters, insect eaters, fruit eaters, nectar eaters, and carnivores and scavengers)? But science doesn't prove anything. Can you prove that the earth orbits the sun or does the sun orbit the earth? The tested theory is that the earth orbits the sun. And the observed data, the hypothesis, and the experiments are beyond the understanding of most people. Most people just accept the science - the earth orbits the sun. It isn't proven. It's a scientific theory. Then you haven't bothered to educate yourself. You are ignorant of the science and are willing to believe the mythology without evidence. Right. That's a problem if you reduce every species to two breeding individuals. They go extinct. In the case of Whooping Cranes, they were protected and their breeding grounds were protected when it was recognized that they were in danger of going extinct. And yet, their numbers continued to fall in spite of all efforts to preserve them. The breeding population fell to about 150 individuals before it began to climb again. No one knows why it continued to fall or why it began to grow again. We do know that Whooping Cranes were very close to the minimum viable population.

Evolution happens in populations. The most common cause of speciation is the isolation of two groups of a single population. The isolated populations continue to change until they become separate species. Try to educate yourself, please. In fact, you are showing your own ignorance.

Fossils are of course mineralised and thus we use different dating techniques such as stratigraphy. Creationism is divided into various groups; YECs who believe the world (Universe) was formed exactly as described in the bible about 7000 years ago. OECs who believe the Earth and Universe are billions of years old, but humans have been around from the start. IDers who believe that ""microevolution"" has occurred under the direction of their deity of choice. (Micro and Macro evolution are more red herrings and don't have any actual meaning, and have changed in usage in the last couple of years).

"10-11-2011","15750",1,"None","None","None","Bennedict","440587","Ah, the argument. Yes. If your co-worker is skeptical of carbon dating, so be it, but let it be known that carbon dating is not the only way of measuring the age of something. There are many independent ways to tell the age of something, and when they all point to approximately the same age for a given artifact, that can be quite convincing. If another method of dating supports carbon dating independently, that can be used as evidence for the accuracy of C14. On the point of finding dinosaur bones where we would not normally expect them to be, or finding human remains hundreds of millions of years old, as Sir Richard Dawkins himself would say, this is the single most convincing piece of evidence for evolution; of the millions (maybe billions?) of fossils ever found in the Earth's crust, not a single one was found in a place in a time period that it shouldn't be. Sure, we may only have found a certain amount of fossils buried, but when the figures are so overwhelmingly so, there's no way to doubt geographical distribution as evidence for evolution. Finding just one rabbit fossil (or any modern animal fossil) that predates modern times would certainly be something, but the fact that unsurprisingly, it hasn't happened yet, is reason to be sure of evolutionary theory. Both pieces of the argument are very easily refuted. In the case of ID, the argument breaks the scientific theory rule of falsifiability.
