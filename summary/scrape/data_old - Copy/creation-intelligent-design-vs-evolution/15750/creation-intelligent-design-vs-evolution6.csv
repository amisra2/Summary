We've already discussed the energy released by the annihilation of virtual particles. We have measured the Energy output of the Big Bang via the CMB. Given that time is quantised at the Planck level the event described must have occurred prior to the first quanta of time. You have shown that you can read, I have answered the question, if you want to read further you can try Google or buy a book.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","06:11 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","76"

"10-22-2011","15750",6,"None","None","None","Ripskar","441323","I have obviously pushed you as far as you are willing to go at this point. Going back to where we were talking about the emergence of virtual particles from the quantum foam; The universe is like a soap bubble, the quantum foam (space-time) forms the bubble wall. We've already stated that virtual particles are independent of space-time though due to the fact that we are part of this universe we are forced to view them through the medium of this universe. it may be that they emerge from the quantum foam in a similar manner as a dolphin emerges from the surface of the sea, and then disappears again. However that is speculation and cannot be inferred from observed data as far as I am aware. So long and thanks for all the fish!","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","07:22 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","78"

Still outstanding for you to support: Ripskar said the question 'what came before time' could easily be countered with QM. Ripskar said that quantum fluctuations come from nothing. Ripskar said that Freedom is a ID advocate.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","10:34 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","79"

"10-23-2011","15750",6,"None","None","None","Ripskar","441429","As stated before you're looking at a quantum fluctuation, which calculated from the energy release of the Big Bang had an equivalent duration of 1x10-160 seconds which means it couldn't have occurred within Space-Time which quantised at 1x10-43 seconds. As such your medium is so far as anyone is aware - nothing. Personal incredulity is not an argument (Unless you're an ID advocate).","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","01:24 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","82"

Arguments from ignorance can be identified by observing the 'missing' dichotomy premise. /A quantum fluctuation such as one that hypothetically created all known non-exotic matter could not exist within the quantum states allowed by observable space-time. //Therefore the big bang quantum fluctuation arose from nothing Is demonstrably invalid, note the single premise. The 'missing' premise is shown in the following: /A quantum fluctuation such as one that hypothetically created all known non-exotic matter could not exist within the quantum states allowed by observable space-time. /If the big bang quantum fluctuation did not occur in observable space time it arose from nothing. //Therefore the big bang quantum fluctuation arose from nothing The second premise if false, making the whole argument unsound, specifically the fallacy of a false dichotomy.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","03:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","83"
