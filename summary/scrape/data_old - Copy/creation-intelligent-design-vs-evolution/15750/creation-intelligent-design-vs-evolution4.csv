Ill try again.It is a hypothesis or is it proven? Let me help you.If I asked if Einsteins general theory of relativity was proven you may say that at least part of it was confirmed by Eddington thus satisfying my curiosity without having to educate me enough to understand the maths behind it.","Ripskar","440846","In which case the Casimir effect of Quantum Fluctuation as stated in my link is one such demonstration. link","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","10:57 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","46"

Do you need a reading comprehension degree or were you searching so long you didn't look at the context? I expect you to drone on with no greater argument than blind assertions and appeals to authority which you assure everyone cannot be understood like all the pseudo-scientific new age cosmic mystics do. I'll give your god no more credence than that of any other religion.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","08:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","51"

However it is the limits of the Relativistic Universe. That means we must abandon that line and move to Quantum Mechanics. As the Creationists can't grasp the concepts involved in the the collapse of Space-Time they are incapable of response in the field of Quantum Mechanics.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","02:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","52"

Ripskar did indeed offer up a counter argument for the argument ""you can't create something from nothing"", issuing the links he posted. The explanation for how QM relates to and counters the argument is within the links themselves. One link even addressed the initial argument directly. On you and ID; it's clear from that link that you were arguing in defense of ID. Whether that's indicative of you being a supporter of ID is negligable. If I may chime in; everyone on this forum knows that you argue for some altered view of IC, and every source available will tell you that IC is an ID argument - the argument was conceived by a proponent of ID; IC is clearly used as an argument to support ID... Again, your view doesn't necessarily plop you into ID territory. You've rather convolutedly explained it to me once before, and I accept that if you say you aren't a supporter of ID, then fine, you aren't.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","02:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","55"

I didn't read them, I know the statement cannot be countered rationally and would just as well see ripskar attempt to do so for it was he who's claim sparked my indignance. Pointing out false arguments is something I do all the time. I have done it to local creationist, to pretty much everyone. I am not an advocate of everything.

You do not ""know"" it can't be countered, as had you bothered to to read the links you (or at any rate someone who has a passing familiarity with science) would have seen it that it has been. You assume that it can't be countered out of ignorance, and to some extent arrogance, which is the principle weakness of the Creationist case as stated at the start of the thread.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","10:29 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","57"

Thus far, I have not seen you apply any method other than attempted invalidation. This is a perfect example, in that one argument was pitched (you can't get something from nothing) and Ripskar countered that argument with the links he used that you neglected to read, referencing QM as a source of acquiring something from ""nothing"". This is a perfectly valid argument, one in which you attempt to invalidate by claiming that he doesn't have an argument in the first place - something I've seen you do many times. See, using invalidation against a valid argument is not only ineffective, but it makes you look really silly. Ripskar referenced a number of links; if anything, you are the one who has not developed a counter argument to QM in response to ""the fallacy of something out of nothing""; you've just not bothered to read his argument and then claimed he doesn't have one. Do you see how silly this looks??","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","12:24 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","58"
"10-20-2011","15750",4,"Freedom","441128","No, attempting one of those are the only two ways to attack an opponents argument, the rest are informal fallacies. I've said my opponent has no argument many times because many times they do not. Most of the time they blather for a bit with informal fallacies and emotional appeals and then quit. Lol, interesting way you phrased that. Try to invalidate a valid argument, yes that won't work. There are only two possible natures of his links, a description of QM which is in no way applicable to the logic of the original statements; or some mystical rhetorical maze such as the one displayed recently with databed and the 1 - 1 = 0 equivocation to NULL = ~NULL","Bennedict","441145","Oh yea, cause opinion based arguments don't exist, to name one. This is the problem with your arguments. You think invalidating someone's argument is the only way to provide one of your own. However, you can only invalidate someone's argument if that argument is... invalid, in the same way you can only falsify someone's argument if it is false and you can show that it is false. I actually read the links Ripskar posted, and not only did they address the issue (falsifying your first assertive claim), but it made complete sense to me, knowing nothing about QM to start with; all was logical and almost based off of fundamental principles of QM (and falsifying your second assertive claim). You're still trying to invalidate Ripskar's argument by saying he doesn't have one when you haven't even read his argument.","creationists-argument-all-plants-animals-existed-same-time","02:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","60"
