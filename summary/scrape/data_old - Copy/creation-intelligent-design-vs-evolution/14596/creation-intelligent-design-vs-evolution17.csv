Also, there is no need to state exactly what you are responding to - just make your point or rebuttal, back it up with supporting statements and close it up. We are grown ups and can piece together an argument without a 'paint by numbers' style of argument.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","01:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","241"

ID is creationism with pseudo-scientific skin, thats a given. IC is an argument used by ID advocates to support the claims made by ID. so, we can conclude that IC is a pseudo-scientific creationist argument, if thats what you want me to say, but all this is ridiculous. if you dont want me to call you a creationist, substantiate your claim that IC has nothing to do with ID. so far, you have not.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","04:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","252"

In case you forgot, 'this all' started when it was claimed that I must be a creationist because espouse IC. 'this all' is about whether or not that is the case. The only way that could be the case is if IC forced via logic any who accept it to the conclusion of creationism. Which means the crucial premise that will decide 'all this' is whether or not one can support ID with IC. and my claim was that it cannot be. lol","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","05:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","253"

"12-21-2010","14596",17,"Freedom","419588","and my claim was that it cannot be. After a searching review of the record and applicable caselaw, we find that while ID arguments may be true, a proposition on which the Court takes no position, ID is not science. We find that ID fails on three different levels, any one of which is sufficient to preclude a determination that ID is science. They are: (1) ID violates the centuries-old ground rules of science by invoking and permitting supernatural causation; (2) the argument of irreducible complexity, central to ID, employs the same flawed and illogical contrived dualism that doomed creation science in the 1980s; and (3) ID's negative attacks on evolution have been refuted by the scientific community.","Xcaliber","419590","So what you're saying is that Behe, as well as all the others who use IC to support ID got it wrong?.. I found this interesting.. Even the Courts disagree with you..lol.. Note the part where he says that IC is CENTRAL to ID... Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District I personally don't know, I don't care...the Term IC refers to Creationism whether it can proven or not, the leading ID'ers consistently try to use IC to support their position. If you disagree I suggest you take it up with the ones who came up with the term to begin with.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","05:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","255"
