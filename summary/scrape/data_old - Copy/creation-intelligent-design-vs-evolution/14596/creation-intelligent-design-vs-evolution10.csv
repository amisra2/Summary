So when you say under no circumstances, do you mean you are so well versed in all evidence and minute theoretical explaination that I could find no possible loophole... or do you mean that you wouldn't understand any of it anyway and in your ignorance would simply assume I was wrong? That statement reveals a sad but destructive belief in you.","Xcaliber","419144","No. I could easily find enough Information to sustain a debate if I thought it would be worth the time and effort , however after witnessing this topic and your conceived notion of debating I find it not worth the time and effort to prove you wrong again. Look.. For me, and this is ME, I'm not speaking for anyone else, There is NO GOD. In order for Human kind to have been Created there would have to be a God, deity, Ghost, Supernatural Something or another in order to Theorize the illogical Idea of Creation. So what I'm saying is that it would be completely pointless for me to enter into a one sided debate. If I don't believe in creation then for me that leaves only Evolution. I make no claim to know all the ins and outs of the Theory because to me Science has carried Evolution well past the Theory stage and is more fact than not. I don't want to understand anything about your Creation because for me personally it doesn't exist and isn't worth the effort . Now.. Your original Position was that IC is not needed to support ID. You are Claiming that IC is a stand alone Theory independent of ID . You have been PROVEN wrong on that whether you choose to believe it or not. That's not me "" Judging "" a debate. No, that's fact vs. fiction proven in writing that you simply refuse to admit. I may not be as well versed on the subject as some would be but I'm not stupid by any means and can see the evidence before me. You present your own theory/ position yet you can't back it up. even your own sources and evidence has proven your position wrong and yet you still continue. I don't think you are qualified to Judge me or my beliefs.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","10:05 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","137"
"12-15-2010","14596",10,"Freedom","419113","Can one support ID with IC? I would not go to nazi headquarters to define jew, just as I would not go to the discovery institute to define evolution. I will however allow them to define what they are claiming they are for. Anything else would be perpetrating a strawman fallacy. So I will get the definition of IC from Michael Behe and I will get the definition of ID from those who support it. By irreducibly complex I mean a single system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning. (Darwin's Black Box [1996], p. 39) where a key piece of a particular scientific puzzle was beyond the understanding of the age. In science there is even a whimsical term for a machine or structure or process that does something, but the actual mechanism by which it accomplishes its task is unknown: it is called a 'black box.' In Darwin's time all of biology was a black box: not only the cell, or the eye, or digestion, or immunity, but every biological structure and function because, ultimately, no one could explain how biological processes occurred. In concluding, it is important to realize that we are not inferring design from what we do not know, but from what we do know. We are not inferring design to account for a black box, but to account for an open box. A man from a primitive culture who sees an automobile might guess that it was powered by the wind or by an antelope hidden under the car, but when he opens up the hood and sees the engine he immediately realizes that it was designed. In the same way biochemistry has opened up the cell to examine what makes it run and we see that it, too, was designed.","Ripskar","419153","ID proponents try to and fail. The fact that IC is simply wrong makes it difficult to give an unambiguous answer. Fairy snuff. From Behe's homepage it is then: Michael J.

"12-15-2010","14596",10,"None","None","None","Bennedict","419197","three people who died long before the foundation of ID, and long before DBB was even written, support the separation of ID and IC. well done. support from people who never even knew the arguments for ID and IC. no. those who support ID support IC as well, and use it as their main argument. prove me wrong! show me a testimony from one of the ID big shots; Behe, Johnson, Dembski... that says otherwise. if you dont, my argument stands and yours falls. again. so, you reject the wikipedia definition of IC for being too evolution based, and you reject the creationwiki definition for being too creationist based. SHOW ME something that says otherwise. not skewed, word-twisted conclusions you came up with, show me Behe or another ID supporter that says straight up, ""ID has no affiliation with the IC argument.""","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","07:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","141"

"12-15-2010","14596",10,"Freedom","419203","Can IC support ID?","trebor","419204","No. It can not. What could support ID is it making predictions and tests that distinguish it from Variation followed by natural selection. IC has been falsified as evidence for ID. What ID fails to do is make predictions and be able to be tested. Until it does that, it is nothing but woo.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","09:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","144"
"12-16-2010","14596",10,"None","None","None","Databed","419221","I think the only way to support ID with any kind of concrete evidence would be to find a signature of some sort in the DNA - to find a bit of code that says ""God was here."" Or maybe if God himself came down and said he was behind it and demonstrated that he could do it again. Since that has not been done, there is no support for ID. IC can't do it because you will never find enough information to support even IC. Even if a structure was IC you still couldn't show it to be in any definitive way. If IC could be proven, then that would be evidence in favor of ID. Isn't this a pointless argument though?","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","12:11 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","145"
"12-16-2010","14596",10,"daewoo","419091","So, what you are saying is that there probably are not going to be any pictures of dirty, satanic sex? Why do I keep coming back here????? On a completely unrelated and off topic note.... The problem you state above is a problem inherent with arguing religion with true believers. They are arguing from a purely illogical position. I hardly think it is surprising that the conversations get ""out there"" a ways. I can hardly see how they could fail to. The other problem seem to be that most of the true believers actually pride themselves on taking things on faith. It literally seems like the less evidence there is to support something, the harder they work to convince themselves it is true. It leads to a situation where the utter lunatics are the most holy. Disturbing indeed.","Accipiter","419229","Something about faith in god makes people believe that they understand everything. What we end up with is a bunch of religious people with strong opinions on a bunch of different issues that they clearly do not understand who end up doing nothing but waste time and money.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","05:10 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","146"
"12-16-2010","14596",10,"Justice","419093","He simply blasts evolution to bits, and leaves a yearning desire for answers in its place. Its not a new desire, everyone's in the history of mankind has has it. Deal with it. Sir, you are a through and through sod.
