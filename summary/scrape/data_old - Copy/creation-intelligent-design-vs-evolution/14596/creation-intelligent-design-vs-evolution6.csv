EvC Forum: Intelligent Design You also indicated that you wish to participate in a more formal debate and CVE is as formal as they come. I see no reason that you wouldn't find CVE delightful unless you are afraid of something. Why don't you think you are a creationist? What else do you call someone who believes that we were created?","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","11:41 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","78"

So will the evolutionist there have more patience and thereby have a greater ability to withstand my repeated freedumb fallacies or should I be afraid because they may actually have a sound rebuttal? Define creationist and I will tell you. Well creationist would be the accurate term but sense it has extra baggage these days I guess you could call one an id advocate.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","12:24 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","79"

I responded in the same form indicating that this is not true, that IC has nothing at all to do with any theory of ID and is in fact totally limited by it's own terms and subject to evolution. Desire at least.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","10:23 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","89"
