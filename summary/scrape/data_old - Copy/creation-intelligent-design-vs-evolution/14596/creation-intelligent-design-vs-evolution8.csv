"12-14-2010","14596",8,"Freedom","419027","Yes but asking your opponent for a definition usually reduces confusion. Even so, thanks I will attempt to use these in the event that databed accepts them. First let me categorize them. Young Earth creationism Humans Directly created by God. Plants/animals directly created by God. Macroevolution does not occur. Earth less than 10,000 years old. Reshaped by global flood. Universe Less than 10,000 years old. Belongs to the category 'God created life and this creation is it's explaination'. Gap creationism Humans Directly created by God. Plants/animals Directly created by God. Macroevolution does not occur. Earth scientifically accepted age. Reshaped by global flood. Universe scientifically accepted age. Belongs to the category 'God created life and this creation is it's explaination'. Progressive creationism Humans directly created by God (based on primate anatomy). Plans/animals direct creation + evolution. No single common ancestor. Earth scientifically accepted age. No global flood. Universe scientifically accepted age. Belongs to the category 'God created life and this creation is it's explaination'. Intelligent Design Proponents hold various beliefs. e.g. Behe accepts evolution from primates Divine intervention at some point in the past, as evidenced by what intelligent-design creationists call ""irreducible complexity"" Some adherents claim the existence of Earth is the result of divine intervention - Scientifically accepted age Belongs to the category 'God created life and this creation is it's explaination' albeit indirectly. Theistic evolution Humans evolved from primates. Evolution from single common ancestor. Earth scientifically accepted age. No global flood. Universe scientifically accepted age. Belongs to the category 'God created life and this creation is it's explaination' (the theistic part being that god designed the universe such that evolution of us had to happen). Given that every definition of creationism falls into that category I declare the key tenet of creationism is the belief that life is explained by God creating it. Since creationism can be said to be the belief that life is explained by god creating it, it as a whole falls under the category of 'explanations for life'. Since databed claims in this paragraph that 'Freedom has been very careful not to assert any explanation for life and its complexity', that universal must include the explaination of 'god created it'. Therefore this states at least ""Freedom has been very careful not to assert that life is explained by God creating it"". Since that belief is necessary and sufficient condition to be defined as a creationist the statement ""Freedom has never asserted (supported in the sense of argument) creationism"" can be deduced. The 'leap' from ""Obviously Freedom is some form of a creationist, but he will not admit this."" to ""He is obviously a creationist"" is one of simple rearranging.","Ripskar","419065","In its broadest sense Creationist simply means believing that a deity created the universe. Within that there is obviously a range of beliefs. Theistic Evolution supporters have no conflict with scientific findings. Young Earthers reject science completely. Gap and Progressive Creationists find some sort of compromise position depending on their own emotions. IDers purposely set out to undermine scientific progress via legalistic means. They were defeated (or defeated themselves) and have fallen from their previously high profile, though some residual effects remain such as IC.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","08:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","110"
"12-14-2010","14596",8,"Bennedict","419066","where the hell does it say that??? what is the time stamp on those frames? ill transcribe the conclusion: still havent found anything that disconnects IC from ID. IC is not helping evolution in any way, in fact that video which you posted to support your argument contains the two bits which disprove your argument entirely. and to be honest, you couldnt have chosen a better video to disprove your argument.","Freedom","419067","It is the statement before these two that allowed their deduction. Unless the concept of a category escapes you, you are simply wasting time because you do not want to admit the truth. If you do not find the conclusion of the video to be: It is a fallacy to support ID/creation by finding problems with evolution, you have serious comprehension problems and I would be willing to put it to a vote. Neither of these things disprove anything I have said in this thread. Then no video exists which disproves my argument.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","09:10 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","112"

I am particularly interested in the satanists involved. Are these the freaky, deformed, axe wielding ""kill the stranded traveler"" satanists, or are these the hot, orgy holding satanists (9th gate types)? If they are the second type, do the scientists get to participate in the orgies? Are there pictures we could review?

"12-14-2010","14596",8,"Bennedict","419071","i think the false connection you are making is that IC is pointing out a flaw in evolution, helping it develop, and should thus be treated as separate from ID. the two points within the video DO actually disprove what you said. you said that IC cannot be used to support ID. when in fact, the video states very clearly that ID/creationists use the argument of IC to support their ""theory."" i do recognize that this is the point of the video however this statement, along with the rest of the video fails to state what you claim it does, which is separate the connection between IC and ID. why is it that you cant admit that youve been proven wrong?","Freedom","419082","I never said anything along those lines. ID and IC are separate, I do not need to demonstrate that everyone believes it to say this. Very good, now you need to think about this paragraph that you have written. The answer is contained within, if you are having a hard time figuring it out; you could present it to a logic student who do hundreds of such operations as I now expect from you. Once you think you have the answer, you should be able to answer this question: Can you support ID with IC and if so how? Then redirect your attention to post 109, specifically to my response to 'well done freedom, posting a video which supports my argument and does nothing for your argument except prove it wrong.' and find a problem with the line of reasoning following the point of the video. Define the connection and you will discover you have been riling on against a strawman. I can lie I just don't.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","10:51 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","115"

Why do I keep coming back here????? On a completely unrelated and off topic note.... The problem you state above is a problem inherent with arguing religion with true believers. They are arguing from a purely illogical position. I hardly think it is surprising that the conversations get ""out there"" a ways. I can hardly see how they could fail to. The other problem seem to be that most of the true believers actually pride themselves on taking things on faith. It literally seems like the less evidence there is to support something, the harder they work to convince themselves it is true. It leads to a situation where the utter lunatics are the most holy. Disturbing indeed.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","11:35 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","120"
