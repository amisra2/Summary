"12-17-2010","14596",12,"None","None","None","Freedom","419340","Depends on how you define 'win', nothing I asserted was refuted if that qualifies as 'won'; but no real attempt was made either. It's like someone saying ""the sky is blue"" and then claiming he won an argument when no one contradicted his statement. I can promise you that anyone reasonably proficient in logic could review this thread and have some serious criticisms on what you think is an argument. I invite any of you (one at a time of course) who believe I have said something incorrect that has been refuted on this thread to a formal debate where I take the resolution that I did not. You can't imagine how sure I am that would someone you disagreed with behave as you are now you would attribute it to their inability to think logically or ignorance.. for I have seen it. When it became clear fartigle could not support anything he said to you, he resorted to name calling; various informal fallacies and eventually quit. Did you 'beat' his arguments? How do you know you weren't a floor?","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","06:28 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","169"

"12-17-2010","14596",12,"Freedom","419344","I updated my post after you responded, if you truly wish to test what you seem to think was an argument in this thread PM me and I will start a post in the formal debate area. It hasn't, not even in the slightest. If you aren't lying through your teeth you will be willing to put that statement to the test minus the rhetoric in formal debate.","Bennedict","419345","i really would not like to... but if you can find a proper moderator that we can both agree would be good, ill consider it.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","07:03 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","173"

It's obvious that here you've been reduced to nothing but a source of condescendinging amusement. Am I right, or am I right? The horse you're flogging is beyond dead, it's friggin decayed. Hey, it's the nature of the beast, forums like this. Look at Easyrider, who's become the religious joke everyone--quite rightly, too--heaps scorn upon . You bucking for his spot... the religious loon every one takes potshots at? Didn't think so. If you really, sincerely, truly believe what you've been posting here, go to a moderated site like EvC Forum , and show us all up by engaging THEM in a ""formal"" debate."" They'll be more than happy to oblige you. And after you've displayed your mettle with the big boys, you can come back here with a plethora of triumphant links under your arm and make us eat our atheistic, rational humanistic words, whereby we'll all bow down to the superiority of your fallacious, irrational ""arguments.""","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","10:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","177"
