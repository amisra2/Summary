"12-20-2010","14596",15,"Freedom","419492","Yea you said that already, you just can't back it up with a simple thing like a quote from me and a quote from anyone that provides any sound||cogent contradictory reasoning to my quote. Yes, that is exactly what I was thinking; I don't even believe it's useful for learning biology. you I am not a creationist, you Furthermore you cannot support ID with IC. you Well creationist would be the accurate term but sense it has extra baggage these days I guess you could call one an id advocate. you You were attempting to indicate that IC is integral to any comprehensive theory of intelligent design. you I responded in the same form indicating that this is not true, that IC has nothing at all to do with any theory of ID and is in fact totally limited by it's own terms and subject to evolution. quote from Behe article 'He finds that direct evolution of IC is logically impossible, and indirect evolution of IC is too improbable."" your response As do I. You would too if you would think about it with an open mind.","Xcaliber","419500","Ok, let me see if I can put an end to this, even if for my own sanity.Below is a series of Quotes made by you throughout this thread. The First Quote is YOU telling me that you do not believe that Evolution is Useful. Other Quotes in the thread lead one to the conclusion that you do NOT believe in Evolution as an explanation of Life. The Second Quote is YOU saying you are not a Creationist. Ok.. I get it now. You are one of those Creationists who is ashamed of being a Creationist. You use terms like Irreducible Complexity and Intelligent Design to Mask the fact that you are a creationist. You call these things SCIENCE, when in fact they have nothing to do with REAL science they are bogus theories implemented by desperate CREATIONISTS to attempt to add credibility to the entire Premise of Creation. Whether you believe that Life was created by an Alien being or some Invisible Higher Power matters not, You believe that there is something other than Evolution to explain Life and thus the Bottom Line is that you ARE A CREATIONISTS. Now the next series of Quotes deals with the IC vs ID. You stated several times that IC could not be used to Support ID. OK.. I'm going to give you the benefit of doubt and assume that the Idea of Irreducible Complexity hold any validity whatsoever. The Answer to your original Question would then be YES, IC can be used to support Intelligent Design . I didn't quote any of the evidence because frankly it would take up several pages to do so, But not only myself, Bennidict, and several others answered your Question we have Shown you Where Behe actually came up with the theory of IC to support intelligent Design. IC could not exist if not for ID. On the other hand.. YOU have posted not one shred of legitimate Evidence to support your position. All you have done is lead everyone in a circle trying to explain to you that which cannot be explained. Like I said before.. You believe in the Theory of IC, that's your Choice. Stop hiding behind your Bogus Theories and just Admit to yourself that You are a Creationist, then go to the EvC forum and let them try to explain to you. My Money is on them... Because you simply won't accept the truth .","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","02:09 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","213"
"12-20-2010","14596",15,"None","None","None","Bennedict","419501","from an ID perspective, IC does support ID. from my own perspective, i am in no position to make such a claim - i associate with neither the IC argument nor ID. i can only speak from testimonies of ID advocates, and the testimonies are clear - IC not only can be used to support ID, but it is the ID proponent's main argument. IC is the only thing supporting ID. again, if freedom still holds the previous claim that IC has no connection with ID, a counter-testimony from a respected (in the ID community) ID advocate, outlining the separation of the two, will be appreciated. also, freedom. how's the moderator search coming along? im out of school now so i have lots of time to debate you.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","02:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","214"
"12-20-2010","14596",15,"None","None","None","Xcaliber","419502","Same here, I don't support IC or ID or any type of Creation theory. But Re-searching the subject of Intelligent Design for the purpose of This thread I have not found ONE SINGLE source which does not use IC to support their intelligent Design Theory. I have found NOT ONE source where Irreducible Complexity is used as a Stand alone Theory.. So Freedom if you have such a source other than your own belief I would be happy to check it out myself. My Bet is that you won't find such a source.....","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","02:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","215"

Yes Yes Indicating you did not get it before, I would agree with that I just made one of those seinfeld 'oh really' faces. Shall we have another thread called 'is there a conspiracy to cover up freedoms beliefs?' Come one, wheres the quotes? Your sanity is at stake here! Premise - /You do not believe evolution explains life Conclusion - //You believe life was designed is an invalid argument, any logician can tell you that. If they do not their bias is to thick to ever be circumvented by argument. I will state it again if you wish. kk The argument is several pages! wow, I would still need to see it before I could ever agree it is sound though. Incorrectly, simply asserting a false hood does not make it true. I have issue with that statement but for the sake of argument I grant it, so put that in an argument to contradict any of my statements. The burden of proof is on he who claims that something exists, you and bennedict have claimed that an argument exists and is valid which uses IC as a premise and concludes ID. I have already identified the only such argument I could think of as a fallacy, I did not need to identify that argument to 'win' but I did for the sake of clarity. The video I posted confirmed that the argument I had in mind was a fallacy, it is not my failure if what I guessed bennedict was talking about was not what he was thinking. It was up to him to state what he was talking about. That which cannot be explained? Do I need to accept 'that' on faith? Like I said before IC is not a theory. As it is your choice to now realize that you have not met the challenge I set for you. You found many of my quotes but have not contradicted any of them with an argument. because that would make it easy on you huh? What are you going to do if I keep claiming that what I believe is what I believe? Say my arguments were whipped again? I would never bet that anyone could convince anyone that they do not know what they believe. I am not saying that can't happen but it is the most absurd of arguments, identical to a strawman in so many ways that 99% of people will just equivocate the two.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","04:45 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","217"

Or a better one. If evolution is correct there should be testimonies from creationist saying so. Why? You tell me. I made the claim that one cannot support ID with IC, I supported that claim by arguing that it's terms limit it to the subject of evolution. You counter claimed that one could support with IC, you never substantiated that. You going to try again?","Bennedict","419514","i did substantiate my claim with testimonies from Behe, Johnson and Dembski. since the general belief is that IC was conceived in the ID realm to be a tool used to enforce ID, if you claim that is not the case, you should be able to find something... anything to support that claim. it is not equivalent to evolution and cream cheese... dont be ridiculous. ive shown multiple quotes by ID advocates outlining that they themselves associate with the IC argument and use it to support ID. if you are claiming that what they are doing does not work, i agree. however, that is my own opinion - for the ID supporters, they do use it. i dont care about ""limiting to the terms of evolution"", the argument amongst ID advocates is the ""random mutation"" bit, which they claim was done by an intelligent agent.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","06:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","223"
