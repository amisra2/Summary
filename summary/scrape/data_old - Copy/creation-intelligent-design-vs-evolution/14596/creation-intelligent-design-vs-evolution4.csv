"12-06-2010","14596",4,"None","None","None","Bennedict","418601","funny how everything in the essay by Amitakh Stanford, posted by Tusa here is wrong, ignorant, unsubstantiated and dishonest. interesting how someone could spent what must have been a painfully long five minutes doing answers in genesis and discovery institute searches to write one of the weakest arguments ive ever read on something that is fundamentally wrong and dishonest. anyways Tusa, enjoy having smallpox, as you surely refuse to be vaccinated due to it being scientific technology.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","07:46 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","47"

On the topic I would like to say that science is not the core issue here, the issue is critical thinking. Critical thinking is the foundation on which all of science is based. Talking about evolution or any other branch of science as a conspiracy to suppress the truth is problematic. What we should be talking about is whether or not critical thinking is a conspiracy to suppress the truth.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","07:46 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","48"
"12-07-2010","14596",4,"Larni","411589","I have heard and read of secularists and scientists and Satanists conspiring to use science to undermine the validity of biblical creation. We see on the net multiple examples of protests that ID should be recognised as a real science and how people who espouse ID sympathies get blackballed and the like. Is this really happening?","Freedom","418680","There is no conspiracy, no scientist is intentionally trying to hide the truth (and when I say no I mean the vast majority are not). but are people who mention ID and question evolution being ostracized for no other purpose; of course. Assigning nefarious motives is just another piece of insanity from creationists, it is quite obvious scientists and academics are trying to remove ID'ers and anti-evolutionists because they are sure they are the ones who have nefarious motives and want to subvert the truth. So in a way there is a conspiracy but an unspoken one. They do not do this for alien hunters or people who believe in jedi; they strive not to take creationism seriously but their responses to anything that hints evolution might be wrong is conclusive proof that they do see it as a danger. Most of what people would classify as persecution from the catholic church had no central authority and was not organized; all it took was a large enough group of people to feel that something should be stomped out.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","10:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","49"

"12-08-2010","14596",4,"Matthew","418698","Only because the arguments for ID stink.","Accipiter","418703","The real problem with ID is that it is a worthless theory. It can not be used to explain anything while evolution is a tool that explains many of the things we observe in nature. If you think about it in that light you will soon realize that it really can't be used in any way and that the entire debate about ID is moot as a result. Could you really see biological science abandoning evolution and putting ID in it's place? They wouldn't know what to do because you can't do anything with it.","there-really-scientific-conspiracy-suppress-trvth","09:03 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","51"

He'll write a bunch of one-sentence paragraphs that will just make you scratch your head and go, ""huh?"" But then he will insist that it makes perfect sense. When you give up because it's long been obvious that you are going nowhere since you can't get past the first premise of his logic, he will claim victory and never talk about it again, instead saying, ""Look back a few posts for a perfectly structured, sound reasoning as to why what you claim is true can't be. Don't you know I have already won this discussion? Why are you bringing it up again?"" I'm going to coin a term: Freedom-logic .

I was simply pointing out that there are indeed practical applications for evolution , I copied what I posted from the Scientific American Magazine January 2009 edition that I have on my bookshelf. I'm not a scientist myself so I won't try to Explain how these things work, but you are free to pick up a copy of the Magazine or Google it if you like, it's some interesting reading to say the least. Point is Now that Practical Application for Evolution has been established , whether you believe it is up to you, I now ask ...
