I find myself loving when you go on and on so that I can continue to wail on you with the Truth Stick of No Mercy. It's usually you who is responsible for shutting yourself up. No, you're branded as a religious zealot when you make arguments that people who don't share your exact beliefs should have their rights taken away. Liberals were responsible for things like abolition of slavery and women's suffrage that overturned the oh-so-traditional status quo. Now we're working toward death with dignity for the terminally ill, reasonable gun control, access to abortion and contraception (without sparking the ire of fundy parents and community members)... are these things that are despised by the rest of the world? No, but things like slavery, sexism, rampant crime, and politicization of private issues are. The main cause of so much hate and disrespect is the phony war we're fighting and our tactics in violation of international law, our attitude of superiority in the world, and our outright bullying of others, all of which are being pushed the most by -- you guessed it -- not liberals. No, Archie, you and your boys can take the blame for that one. Archie's projection complex strikes again! Pretty much, we can take whatever Archie says and know that the truth is the precise opposite.","freedom-speach","04:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","6"

I can see why some reviews have called it ""important"" and ""powerful"". It was very good, not a comedy as some may attempt to describe it. It had a little of Ben Stein's mysteriousness and humor to it, but it was generally serious, and some may say, depressing. It was nice to see the people whose writings I had seen on the net, but had never seen speak before or even a picture of - Myers, Ruse, Berlinski, etc. I'll address the six points from your first link, that's all I have time for tonight. 1) Nitpicking. The movie wasn't attempting to link euginics and the holocaust to Darwin himself nearly as much as it was showing its relationship with Darwinism in general. I don't think linking Darwinism and societal atrocities are an unprovoked first assertion. It's a response to atheists/evolutionists who constantly link religion with societal atrocities. 2) Informed viewers of Expelled might NOT think Stein was giving speeches on college campuses, if they had any knowledge of ""speech codes"" and other games played in todays universities to keep conservatives out. When I saw that scene, I sure didn't think it was a college campus. I didn't give much thought to where it was, but it was no crime to stage it. It is a movie, after all. 3) Crying that they didn't know what they were being interviewed for? If they'd have known, would they have refused to participate, or lied about something? 4) Yes, there are all kinds of long winded rants about all the details of how the ID proponents were being treated perfectly fair. It's up to anyone who actually watched the movie to decide if these people just weren't intelligent enough to make the grade, while ALL the Ward Churchill's of the academic world seldom seem to have any problems. 5) HELLO!! THAT'S WHY!! Then we see the standard dance of how innocent and objective science really is. 6) And the standard ""theistic evolution"" dance. Atheistic evolutionists can't get along without it! I wonder if Kenneth Miller will see the movie, and comment on it. I wonder if he'd have refused to be a part of it.","freedom-speach","08:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","9"

It takes a few minutes to read those posts, but it takes an hour and a half to watch Expelled ; does that mean that IDers are having the mother of all panic attacks? Your logic can't even be described as ""tortured,"" marc, because it's completely nonexistent. See Collin's response below. Irrelevant. Even if we assume that accusations of religion's negative influence are misplaced, two wrongs don't make a right. Either Darwinism and social atrocities are related, or they are not. Frankly whether they are has nothing to do with whether evolutionary theory is true or whether science expels dissenting opinion. The topic is completely tangential to the alleged point of the movie, which is because the movie is pure propaganda intended to dupe people like marc into thinking that these issues are topical. The classic example is: gravity makes countless people fall to their deaths every year. This isn't an example of one Holocaust-like instance of mass death; no, this is continual, yet nobody has made a fuss about it in the scientific community. This is because scientists are evil and out to destroy dissenters by letting gravity do the dirty work. We must dispel this mythical gravity idea as pseudoscience and replace it in schools with Intelligent Falling theory. 1) You think that most viewers of the movie will be informed? You sure as hell weren't until you came back and read a link that you wouldn't have read on your own. 2) Presenting the scenario as if Stein were addressing an actual audience when the ""audience"" is composed of virtually nothing but stand-ins is dishonest no matter which way you slice it. To say that it's okay to be misleading because it's a movie just backs up the point that we've been making all along. These people aren't interested in presenting truth; it's all about propagandism. Some of them know (from experience, because many nutjob anti-evolutionists are positively dishonest -- like Mathis & Co.) that statements have to be phrased carefully for at least one of (at least) two reasons: First, these people know a sh*tload less about the technicalities than the interviewers do; second, words may be chosen more carefully to try to prevent snippets being used out of context. You can see both in this instance, with the explanation of one postulation involving crystals and Dawkins referring to the ultimate Darwinian development of any theoretical panspermia initiators (which got cut off to be spun into a ridiculous quote mine). Notice that nowhere here do you address the claims and evidence -- which the movie apparently lacks -- about the assertions of ""the expelled."" Trying to deflect attention from your inability to respond substantively won't fly with us; these guys are fudging the stories and sharing only selected pieces in a specific attempt to hide what really happened. For what it's worth, I feel a hell of a lot more vulnerable as an atheist in my profession and location than IDers should feel in research and teaching academia. HOLY SH*T, marc. You're doing EXACTLY WHAT THE REVIEW SAYS YOU PEOPLE DO . You're making the claim without giving any explanation. ""OMG TEH SCEINCES IS ATHIESTIC BECUZ THEY JUST AER!!"" Thanks for making it extremely clear. Refuting a point by demonstrating it isn't very effective. Seriously, how disconnected from reality does one have to be in order to do something like this? Believe me, marc, we certainly can. The fact that it damns your argument is no skin off our backs. In fact, it damns your argument so much that the producers know it. See below. He didn't refuse because the filmmakers specifically avoided having him a part of it. (Why, because it would ""confuse"" the viewers. Of course it would confuse the viewers: Miller is disproof of the entire concept of atheistic bias in science!) If they approached him with the lie that the project was for ""Crossroads,"" I bet he'd have agreed. If they'd been honest and told him that it was a smearing propaganda piece... well, what do you think, oh-so-informed-viewer? You must never get tired of making stupid arguments and having your points eviscerated, marc. See you tomorrow.","freedom-speach","12:29 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","13"
"04-21-2008","11164",1,"None","None","None","Iuris","309292","Um, for some reason, I keep thinking the OP is actually a bot. One word answers, usually not showing much of a connection to the topic, hardly legible... Or maybe it's just me. Anyway, there's quite enough freedom of speech going on around. The problem is people will often hide the true reasons they lost their jobs. Like a ""Santa"" actor, who claimed that he was fired because the ""Ho ho ho"" was insulting to women, while in truth, he disregarded a series of rules about how to behave while being Santa (the booming laugh was found to sometimes scare the children, so it was to be avoided and similar). With religion, it's similar. Believing in ID is one thing. But then ignoring things that are vital to the job because they conflict with ID is a different thing. Imagine taking your pet to a vet and finding out that the doctor didn't believe in the bacterial theory of infection and instead started performing an exorcism ritual on it...","freedom-speach","06:05 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","14"
