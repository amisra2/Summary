This is particularly true when you start bringing in the strawman of 'sub atomic' when it comes to the TOE. When someone is getting so many very basic things wrong, it shows that they are not educated in the subject matter. The fact you are pretending to be , yet are coming out with this garbage, and getting defensive about it can lead people to a large number of other conclusions.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","03:13 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","362"

Apparently you have the grade school education if you can't understand what he is saying about the claims made by ToE. It says that from a single celled organism all life evolved via random mutations. That means that at some point in the alleged history of this theory called evolution, either dogs evolved into cats or vice/versa.

"02-14-2010","12023",25,"Esdraelon","390444","No, I am not confusing the two, I understand both quite well. Think again: According to evolutionists at the moment life occurred from inanimate matter, it began evolving , thus evolutionists have a greater quandary than you infer since there is an almost nonexistent line where abiogenesis ended and evolution began. LOL, think again: We are NOT speaking of astrologers today but those back in biblical times. That is in the context of what I said. If you objective is to play upon what you claim is my 'confusion', then you get a failing grade. My inference was that 'religion', ie belief in a Diety(s), came before science, thus science was introduced.","Larni","390455","There is no quandary. At one point there was no life, then there were replicating molecules (whether it would fit what we call life today, is unclear). Abiogenesis (of some form) took place in the past. Then there was information transmission via error and natural selection of the first replicating molecules. I fail to see the quandary. You implied 'scientists' were once little more than astrologers. Astrology cannot be considered science in what ever era simply because science is that which follows the scientific method: astrology never did this so Astrologers did not become scientists. But this makes no sense. You are implying that religion coming before science actually begat science (your 'thus science' clause).","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","04:26 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","364"
"02-14-2010","12023",25,"Esdraelon","390440","The laws of nature govern that processes such as the creation of snowflakes, sic, are endlessly repeated whenever the natural processes are conductive to such creation. 'Life' however, is a paradox, and if you presume to use the snowflake analogy you fall into error as common descent infers that all life came from one single cell, in which life happened by the merest chance.","Larni","390457","So you say a snow flake can form naturally but life can't? Show me how life cannot form naturally. Or show me an example of designed life by a non human hand. The bottom line is that there is no reason to believe that life needs anything other than nature for it to exist. I'll ask this for the second time: Please explain the reason for life requiring design (aside from personal incredulity).","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","04:32 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","366"
"02-14-2010","12023",25,"Archangel","390443","Look at the elegance and uniqueness of snowflakes. Is this an example of randomness or individualism by an organized system of creation?[/CENTER]","Larni","390458","So the designer creates every single snow flake?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","04:34 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","367"

The first replicating molecules were not modern cells. You also forgot to mention natural selection goes hand in hand with mutation; greatly increasing the speed of evolution. As for the dogs and cats they evolved from miacids in the Eocene so when you imply that ToE stipulates that 'either dogs evolved into cats or vice versa' you are wrong. Why would you expect the organism on one planet not to be genetically connected through a common ancestor?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","04:46 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","369"

But it is not up to me to show you. Only in your opinion, and in the opinions of those resistant to any other alternative, I presume? But again, the question is not to be laid at my doorstep, it is upon yours. I have not suggested that life requires ID, only that the mechanics and complexity appear to point in that direction.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:32 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","371"
"02-14-2010","12023",25,"Freedom","390459","By using pre-existing functionality you are not defeating that observation you are side stepping it. you cannot say that an irreducible complex system can be reduced by reducing components with different purposes when it is the function of the system that would allow it to be selected for. You are moving the ""chance"" factor from the mutation to the chance that existing elements will form the system, natural selection can still not select for what does not function so you are still talking about extreme improbability WITHOUT gradual selection. For instance if I said cell structure A was irreducibly complex you could say ""well it could have formed in one shot as a massive lucky mutation"" or ""it could have formed from several pre-existing systems that were being selected for"" Exactly, so what happens when there is nothing to modify? evolution can't reach beyond natural selection and selection works only on what is functional. Therefore functionality is a pre-requisite to evolution. The first life form had to have DNA and had to reproduce itself by copying that DNA, if it did not it could not evolve. Think about what you are saying, if it isn't a cell it can't reproduce with mutation, no modification with decent which means no evolution, which means it was the random result of atoms and molecules bonding. That regression does not exist if there is a design, and it seems to be taken for granted that there is design. Note how even the most blind evolutionary scientist speaks of how evolution produced ""this design."" It is the combination of order, complexity, and energy that is specific to life. The number of components is always directly proportional to the chaos except in life. The most orderly crystals have the most homogenous particles (the least different components), the most complex systems appear to be the most disordered (weather), and the most energetic systems are the most chaotic (stars). It appears to be a design by as sound thinking as a car appears to be a design. Consider for a moment that you did not know that someone designed a car, what would lead you to believe that it was designed if anything? Please explain the reason for life being a consequence of the laws of physics? Or is that the same question? Your error is to say that no scientific explanation can equal a scientific theory. The people who formed ideas based on a book called ""the origin of species"" and called it science. They have taken the non-existence of a supernatural or ultra-natural entity as a granted and used that to conclude that the origin of species must have been unintentional. I will apply the scientific method to all knowledge including the hypothesis of ID. They are backed up against the wall if they are claiming they know something that they don't, not before. You can attempt the separate the origin of life from the theory of evolution but I will not accept the claim without some reason. The method of evolution is not yet known, it must be a method capable of forming useful functionality without existing functionality. It is extremely cogent thinking to believe that that mechanism would be the same one that formed life, as it is the same outcome (functionality formed), the same subject material (chemicals).","Larni","390463","I don't see what observation is being side stepped. Please explain what observation is being side stepped. This can be resolved by scaffolding. A system with function A becomes redundant and then looses components to become useful in a different domain. The point is that function of a system can change from the original function. No I'm not. That's not what I'm doing. Please show me where I have done this. I would say nothing of the sort. I would say that structure A has lost systems that acted as a scaffold and so it only looks IC. Bottom line is that IC is an argument from incredulity. I hope you can see that in neither case is structure A being selected for. There is no evolution. You need something replicating imperfectly for evolution. Yes, natural selection needs something to work on but mutations always occur and it is only a matter of time till NS 'detects' it and selects for it. More likely it was RNA. You don't need a cell to have RNA (or DNA). I'd like to draw your attention to the RNA world. RNA world hypothesis - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia So you say that there must be a designer if there is a design? Circular logic. When scientist talks about a 'design' they do not mean 'made by a designer'. It is a figure of speech. Ask yourself why an 'evolutionist' so intent on evolution would actual mean such a thing literally. Substantiate or withdraw your assertion. A car shows evidence of design such as serial numbers. Life does not. Please show evidence of design in something not made by humans. You are the one adding the extraneous variable into the equation. You are the one claiming that a designer must be there for life to work. I say life works without one. We already know that life functions; you have to substantiate your claim that it requires a designer. You are in a sense asking me to prove a negative. This cannot be done. I'm asking you to substantiate a positive. You should be able to do that. Please do. No idea what you mean by this. Have you read it? I can't believe someone who has would make such an assertion. Darwin's book deals with evolution not abiogenesis. The existence of the supernatural is not taken into consideration, either for or against as to science it is not relevant. Even the Pope believes in evolution. Very noble. If you do some research you would be definitely breaking new ground as there's bugger all out there today. What are these scientist claiming? I'm still in the dark. They are two different areas of study. A scientist studying abiogenesis is not using the ToE. Yes it is. Imperfect replication and natural selection.[/QUOTE] This is not what ToE predicts. You are imagining hopeful monsters. No. Again you are conflating ToE with abiodenesis.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:42 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","372"
