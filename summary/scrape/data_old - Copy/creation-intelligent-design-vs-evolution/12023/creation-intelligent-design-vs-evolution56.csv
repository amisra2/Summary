The production of uniqueness in final genetic material is due to recombination. So given that I could only have had some mix of four sets of chromosomes, are you really maintaining that there was as many significant possibilities as there were gametes? It is not an novel function as I explained before. That is why it is important to expose them with IC.","Stonewall","432899","On average, siblings only share 50% of their genes with each other. That's significant. Those combinations of 'sets' of chromosomes can number into the billions, though. Whole chromosomes don't stick together and recombine with each other... they split up into many, many bits when they recombine. You either don't know what you are talking about or you're just arguing nonsense for the sake of arguing. And since a mother doesn't release many eggs during her lifetime, yeah, I would say that there are far more possible genetic combos than there are gametes. derp","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:48 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","826"
"06-22-2011","12023",56,"Freedom","432865","If they are using rational evolution as their model they cannot claim to have demonstrated a process that creates novel functions. Anyone who has argued against IC eventually implies one or the other as they must (unless they give up). kenneth miller. More importantly though the term 'could' is quite useless in the context of probabilities. Anything can happen because there is no limitation on what mutations can happen. IC proves that selection has nothing to do with it... It is the case, as I said by miller; and others. Certainly those who have argued against IC on this forum. If they would admit that natural selection cannot mitigate the odds of forming a novel system then your claim would have merit... but they won't. The reason they won't is because then people like behe will bring them a flagellum and a simple odds calculation which they refuse to deal with. The reason I asked about the books you referenced was because I am interested in an analysis of the odds, but not more denial founded in ignorance intentional or otherwise. Right, the key word is 'process'. Just because there is no process does not mean something cannot happen, it just means you can't have a theory which predicts the outcome. Could a mutation that created a flagellum have happened? Technically yes, but that is hardly an explaination and every time you insist evolution can't be 'just' mutation you back me up. IC helps explain evolution in a more precise way than the descriptions which inevitably intentionally ignore any kind of temporal analysis of selection. He's [Behe is] making the same mistake they are and you know I've said it. Adaptive evolution vs ? If a system can be modified to work better in different conditions it can happen by rational evolution and it is adaptation. There is nothing wrong with that model. Further IC is not restricted to bio-chemestry but is less intuitive at larger levels because by definition larger levels are abstract derivations of smaller patterns. The functions on the macroscopic level far fewer than they are made out to be hence the massive number of strawmen against IC. For instance wings, legs, and flukes are all quite diverse in their application but the function is the same, a limb held rigid by bones and motivated by contracting muscles tied to central control system. It's not confusing unless you assume the same dichotomy that behe does, and that implicitly atheist do. IC isn't a theory of life, it doesn't explain how RM and NS jointly produce anything, it identifies the possible interactions of NS and RM which indicates what they will produce and why (or why not). None of those selections do anymore to explain the system or reduce the odds of it's formation than random mutation does because with respect to the system they are just as random.","Matthew","432919","Sure they can. It's called mutation. If you don't think that mutations can create novel functions, then I really don't what to say. They can cause enzymes to change their shapes in such a way that the cleave molecules they couldn't do anything with before. They can cause pigments to become sensitive to light wavelengths they couldn't detect before. (See Carroll's discussion of birds and ultraviolet vision, of which more later. Again, sorry I can't provide the page number, since I lost the book.) And more and more. Unfortunately, mutations can also cause novel failures of function, often with lethal results. If a mutation enables an enzyme to cleave something it couldn't before, but disables it from doing something absolutely vital to the organism, then this is a problem. But that, of course, is where natural selection kicks in. To say that mutation can produce a novel function (or failure of function) for a single individual is not to say that the function has ""evolved."" For that, we need to show that random mutation plus natural selection made the function common amongst an entire population (or made it uncommon, or even drove the population extinct). (And let me just reiterate that I believe there is a great deal of vagueness surrounding the use of terms like ""novel function"" and ""creates."") And by way of clarification and segue: while random mutation can produce novel functions, random mutation by itself is not evolution. This is just false. No one says that random mutation is evolution, or that it can produce complex structures at a single stroke. No one says that natural selection even has anything to work on without variations ultimately derived from mutation, and it certainly doesn't call forth mutations of either a helpful or hurtful kind. If you think that there are people who say these things, then provide your evidence. You won't find them in the literature, even the popular literature, and you won't even find them on this board. As for giving up, well, people often opt out of arguments when, no matter how many times they say x, they are chastised for not saying x. Only random mutation plus natural selection qualifies as adaptive evolution (more on the qualifier in a moment, since it was evidently confusing). Only random mutation plus natural selection can produce complex features, and it needs a lot of time (generation time, not necessarily a fixed measure) to do so. I know of no evolutionary biologist who claims otherwise. It's time for you to put up or shut up on this score. Meanwhile, on the matter of arguing that something could happen according to a given sequence, therefore it did happen according to a given sequence, you offer the following individual as an exemplar: I presume that you are referring to his suggestion of an evolutionary relationship between the flagellum and the type III secretory system, or TTSS. I would suggest that you don't understand his argument. Why would I suggest this? In part, because he explicitly states that he is not arguing that because one of these structures could have evolved from the other, it did. On page 58 of Only a Theory , he notes that some proponents of intelligent design have pointed to speculation that the TTSS evolved from the flagellum as proving that the smaller system couldn't be the actual ancestor of the flagellum. That might be so, but other scientists have suggested quite the opposite, and in any case, it actually doesn't matter if today's TTSS is the ancestor of anything. It is absolutely correct to argue to that the existence of the TTSS today doesn't answer the question of how the flagellum actually evolved. But that overlooks why the ID camp believed that irreducible complexity was so critical in the first place: They thought it proved that the flagellum couldn't have evolved. It doesn't. [boldface added] He is not trying to argue that the flagellum evolved from the TTSS, and he certainly isn't claiming so on the basis of the fact that it could have. Nor is he arguing the opposite on the same absurd basis. He is arguing that it is in fact possible for a part of the flagellum to have had a different but selectively advantageous function, such that a subsequent mutation could alter the structure and hence its function -- and therefore the claim that this could not happen is false. First, is the phrase ""could not"" similarly useless? Because that's what Behe is saying about evolution: evolution could not produce the structures that he calls ""irreducibly complex."" Since that's what he claims for IC, why is it useless to consider what ""could"" happen? Second, it is not the case that ""there is no limitation on what mutations can happen."" There are only 20 amino acids to code for. There are only 4 DNA bases to arrange into the triplets that will do the coding, and the code is degenerate. Some mutations are even functionally invisible. All in all, there are only so many ways for a mutation to happen, given the genes that are already present . It is not the case that mutation means just anything can happen. And in any event, without natural selection, whatever does happen thanks to mutation wouldn't lead to the evolution of a population. Wait a minute, selection has nothing to do with what , exactly? I thought that ""rational evolution"" meant random mutation, plus natural selection? A rather confusing way of putting it. What does that even mean? Natural selection does not ""form novel systems?"" Blech. Just more vagary. And yes, I know you've tried to explain it before, I just don't think you've succeeded. Random mutation in genes can lead to the development, in an individual, of a simple feature that is new. If it's a helpful feature, natural selection will cause that individual's advantage-conferring genes to spread through the population, at a rate and to a degree depending upon how great the advantage. If it's hurtful, natural selection will purge those genes from the population in the same way -- perhaps even by purging the population itself. This -- random mutation plus natural selection -- is evolution. Now, of course, nature isn't static, so what's advantageous or disadvantageous can vary. Still, that's the basic model, as I understand it. For complexity, all that's needed is whole series of mutations and their selection events. That's what needs to be reconstructed. They won't deal with that odds calculation because it's a straw man. The odds are insurmountable, if and only if one presumes that one goes from not even one component of what is now the flagellum to the flagellum. But since no one makes this presumption, that odds calculation is irrelevant. I wold highly recommend them, especially Carroll's The Making of the Fittest , especially his discussion of the evolution of ultraviolet vision in birds. I'd also recommend Dawkins' discussion of the Lenski experiment in The Greatest Show on Earth , noting particularly that one strain of the bacteria developed the ability to feed on citrate while the others did not. UV vision in birds and citrate-feeding: novel functions that initially occurred in an individual via random mutation and subsequently spread through whole populations via natural selection. Novel functions, in short, that evolved, by our very definition of evolution in terms of the combination of random mutation and natural selection. But don't take my word for it. Read the books. I'm not sure what you mean by ""prediction"" in the context of reconstructing past events. Beyond that, all I can say is, we are clearly in agreement that a single random mutation cannot create something as complex as a flagellum. All I'm trying to argue, and all that evolutionary theorists argue too, is that an entire series of random mutations, each of which is subject to natural selection, can eventually produce a complex feature like a flagellum as a feature of a whole species of organisms. What Behe claims is that such a sequence of mutational and selective events can not bring about a flagellum. Unfortunately for his argument, ""irreducible complexity"" fails to prove anything of the kind. And this is one of those moments where I just have no idea what you're even talking about. By trying to understand whole series of mutations and selective conditions, evolution is always a temporal analysis. Mutations are events in time; just look at how the Lenski experiment figured out when not one but two mutations occurred to enable citrate consumption. Selective conditions change over time; just look at how paleontologists try to explain why legs would be advantageous for early tetrapods before they even left the water. It's always a matter of temporal analysis. If anything is non -temporal, it's IC. This is exactly why Behe uses it to support the intervention of an intelligent designer. It's not a process occurring over time. Poof! The designer produces instantaneously the complexity that random-mutation-plus-natural-selection cannot. Except that you're using exactly Behe's conceptual weapon. In his hands, it is a weapon to argue that random-mutation-plus-natural-selection cannot produce complex biological phenomena from simpler precursors over time. In your hands, I can't see it working any differently. I realize that you say ""rational"" evolution is RM+NS. What's consistent with this is denying IC, not defending it. So, I don't think you're being consistent. Vs. non-adaptive evolution. Genetic drift, which isn't a matter of natural selection at all, but has nothing to do with adaptations to an environment, is a real feature of evolution. Particularly in small populations, it is very important. Agreed. I wouldn't call it ""rational"" evolution. All that evolution means is genetic change within a population over time. This doesn't have to involve adaptation, as in genetic drift. But RM+NS is indeed a fully adequate model for explaining how organisms come to be adapted to their environments. So wings, legs, and flukes are also irreducibly complex? Come on, Freedom. Adopt a !@#% consistent position. Is it possible for a wing to come about through an entire sequence of random mutations, subject to natural selection? If so, then IC is baloney, because it says such things are too complex to have evolved. You can't say ""RM+NS produces IC systems."" That makes a mockery of the whole argument. I'm not even raising Behe's false dichotomy of evolution and design. I'm raising the logical dichotomy of RM+NS being sufficient to account for complex biological phenomena or not being sufficient to account for them. What you seem to be saying is, RM+NS are sufficient, and that IC proves it -- which is confusing insofar as the entire point of IC is to show that RM+NS are not sufficient. So your IC means something completely different than what Behe's IC means? Beyond that, I just don't understand what you're driving at here. Selection isn't supposed to reduce the odds of a system's formation. It's supposed to take the genes that formed a system and promote them through or purge them from a gene pool. Moreover, it isn't random with respect to the system, insofar as whether the system gets promoted or eliminated is determined by the system itself at work under the selective conditions. The appearance of the system in the first individual is random; whether it spreads through or disappears from the population is not. How does any of this have anything to do with IC?!? -sigh- This is why I quit with you before, Freedom. I can't see how you're being consistent. I cant even see what your point is anymore. What's wrong with evolutionary theory?

"06-23-2011","12023",56,"Freedom","432949","All the examples that have ever been brought to my attention (and I think I know what enzyme you are talking about) have been vastly hopeful in their proposed implications. For instance if we are talking about the same enzyme it function was to cut the types of molecules it did, all the excitement was over a adaptation to a new variant of chemical. It's like saying a human can eat a dish he never has before has just evolved a novel function. I do not claim that the fact that benefit becomes prominent is unexplained. As I explained in my posts on guided genetic change/ guided mutation natural selection post production is useless to explain production, and thus no single mutation can be produced by evolution even if it was selected. The only other alternative is that no one has argued against IC, which you might be able to convince me of given the right definition of argue ... No. I am owed much explanation on this subject, far too many have quit and never retracted their assertions. I maintain that those things have been implied to me several times in an attempt to defend against IC, if you want to argue about IC you can but if you just want to argue about who said what you can go find one of the half a dozen threads in which I have said the exact same thing consistently in as many ways as I could think of. If you think you can argue against IC without implying one of those fallacies then it wouldn't matter if anyone else said them would it, that would just mean they were wrong if they did. Hey thanks for finding that, databed didn't believe me when I told him some thought the ancestry was the reverse. Good, then tell that to all those who brought his dialog to me to to answer 'how'. If he was not claiming that a flagellum could have evolved the way he described... ...then I have no problem with him but that would mean those who posted his dialog as support were mistaken about what he was saying (as well as I). I know that, but it betrayed a misunderstanding of that which he was arguing against. IC doesn't say that co-option or mutation could not happen they are just saying they are random and useless to explain the system any more than random mutation alone would. That's because evolution isn't ""anything that produces A"" it's an explainable process which produces viable biological structures. You can make a dent in a car by hitting it with a rock or by smashing it with feathers. If someone says smashing it with feathers won't do it; and in response someone tells him 'but you admitted a rock could do it!' I repeat there is no limitation on what mutations can happen. I have also had this discussion on what evolution means a half dozen times, wrote paragraphs on why 'a change in allele frequencies' is a double standard definition... ...and even more on why no single mutation selection pair is explained by the process (i.e. the odds have to be considered). [Quoting me:] They won't deal with that odds calculation because it's a straw man. The odds are insurmountable, if and only if one presumes that one goes from not even one component of what is now the flagellum to the flagellum. But since no one makes this presumption, that odds calculation is irrelevant. As far as I am concerned you just implied (b). They won't deal with that odds calculation because it's a straw man. The odds are insurmountable, if and only if one presumes that one goes from not even one component of what is now the flagellum to the flagellum. But since no one makes this presumption, that odds calculation is irrelevant. Doesn't sound worth it. For one your sad attempt to label them novel functions is a count against them, and I suspect they do the same. I am only going to say this once in this string: A modification of a function which allows another application is not a novel function. If you think it is I point you to the immune system and bacteria which constantly change, mutations which allow the bacteria to infect new hosts and the immune systems to fight new contagions. Novel application? Yes, Novel function? No. That's the easy part. Now you have to realize that co-option does not alter the odds. And a whole series of random mutations each, which didn't really have any selection could do it too with the exact same probability. Why? because any selections that happened to occur before the system existed were, what did you like to say? 'indifferent' to the non-existent (system to be explained).[boldface added] I see no purpose in separating a string of unselected mutations, it simply doesn't matter if 25 mutations ended up in some sequence or 10 slightly larger ones. I refer to them collectively as a mutation. No he argues, as I argue; that the selection events are irrelevant... ...and anyone who comes up with any explaination is claiming the exact same thing as someone who omitted the meaningless selection events. (spontaneous generation) All IC does is prevent someone from contradicting this premise. Ah, the old change in allele frequencies definition No, muscles, bones, and nervous systems are. Nothing, the problem is what people claim it explains.","Matthew","432994","Which just goes to show how vague and arbitrary the delimitation of ""novel function"" is. First, the analogy. If someone has never eaten blueberries or bok choy before, and then he does, I can see no reason to call this a ""novel function"" in evolutionary terms; these are perfectly normal foods for a human being, regardless of whether this or that individual happens to eat them. If, however, no one has ever eaten nightshade berries or rhubarb leaves without lethal consequences before, and then someone does, it seems to me that this is a ""novel function"": a function that is new to any member of the species. If it provides a fitness benefit, then it will spread, and the species has evolved. Now similarly, if a microbe develops the capacity to subsist on citrate rather than just glucose thanks to an enzymatic mutation, why shouldn't this be thought of as a ""novel function?"" Yes, it had the capacity to eat already, in an entirely general sense of ""eat."" But it could not eat citrate -- note: it's not merely the case that this microbe did not eat citrate, but that no microbes of its kind could eat citrate. We are talking not about a mere incidental change in the details of an individual's life history, but of a change in capacities for any member of that species. Seems novel to me. And similarly again, if a bird develops the capacity to see ultraviolet light because one of its opsin proteins has mutated, why shouldn't this too be thought of as a ""novel function?"" Yes, the bird could ""see,"" speaking generally. But it could not see in the ultraviolet spectrum at all, and now it can. This is not just a change in what the bird does see, as a matter of fact, but a change in what it can see, as a matter of capabilities. Quite novel. (And again: I highly recommend Carroll's book. This discussion is quite, ahem, illuminating, if you'll pardon the pun. All that has to happen for a bird to see ultraviolet light is a single change in a single protein, and there are multiple ways that the relevant gene can mutate in order to code for that change in the protein. Factor in generation time and fecundity, and it's pretty clear how random mutation will provide the change eventually. -- Which is probably why the evolution of ultraviolet vision appears to have happened independently in a dozen or so separate lineages of birds.) In short, I think the distinction of what is and what isn't a ""novel function"" is being made arbitrarily. And here I think we're back to my ongoing complaint about the vagueness of ""production."" For starters, no one claims that evolution ""produces"" mutations. That's actually backwards: mutations, when they are selected, produce evolution. As for the beneficial feature itself, it is ""produced"" in an initial individual by mutation, as I already noted. (""Sure they can. It's called mutation."") The enzyme necessary for an E. coli to eat citrate is produced by a mutation. The opsin necessary for a bird to see ultraviolet light is produced by a mutation. Further, the beneficial feature is ""produced"" as a feature of the species by subjecting that initial mutation to natural selection. Since eating citrate and seeing ultraviolet evidently enable the organisms with such capacities to survive and reproduce more effectively than those without them, the features spread through the population. If what you're concerned about is explaining why a given mutation itself occurs, in a given individual, well, this is not what evolution even attempts to explain. Molecular genetics is working on it, though. If what you're concerned about is why a beneficial mutation is in fact beneficial, evolution can seek to explain this. It can attempt to show how a given feature affects fitness, given the actual environmental conditions in which that feature occurs. I guess I don't see why any of this presents some grand problem for evolution, such that it doesn't explain how features get ""produced."" In individuals, explaining how mutations occur is a task for genetics. In populations, explaining how an initially aberrant feature becomes a normal feature of the species is a task for evolution. Where's the problem? Ultimately, it seems like a semantic point, concerning ""produce."" Evolution -- random mutation plus natural selection -- ""produces"" the features of species. It does not ""produce"" the features of individuals, save insofar as they are typical members of their species. Actually, there is at least one other alternative: Perhaps you haven't understood what others are saying as well as you think you do. Perhaps?... Perhaps they never retracted their assertions, because they felt no need to, insofar as they did not say what you thought they said. Perhaps?... Actually, I'll provide as much evidence for my claim as you just did for yours by saying that I don't think other people -- not you, but other people -- were saying what you thought. And they've done so at least half a dozen times. Moreover, I would really appreciate it if you would provide me some direct quotations of published authors in the field to give me an idea of what experts you're talking about. People on this board are one thing. Professional biologists (some on this board are, I gather, but the great majority are not) are another. Show me what experts in the field say what you charge them with saying. Indeed. But the fact is, I don't think you have shown that anyone is guilty of such fallacious reasoning in criticizing IC. Not even once. In fact, your use of Ken Miller as an example of it was entirely erroneous, for example. I think the passage I quoted amply demonstrates your mistake. Confronted with it, you respond: Well, great, databed made a mistake about the ancestry -- maybe. But the plain fact is, you've misunderstood Miller's argument. And still do (which is why I'm loathe to attribute an error to databed): Actually, he was claiming that it could have evolved that way! Or that it could have evolved in a similar way, maybe even in the reverse sequence. Regardless of which sequence is right, he is arguing that the flagellum could have evolved via such a sequence, against someone, namely Behe, who claims that it could not have evolved according to any such sequence. But he still isn't arguing that the hypothetical sequence he offers is the way the flagellum did evolve, just because it's a way the flagellum could have evolved. Meanwhile... It is great that you admit being mistaken about Miller here. But you're actually mistaken about the nature of your mistake, as indicated in my preceding paragraph. So I actually think that those who've been posting about Miller on this thread in the past -- including databed, for example -- probably understand his argument better than you do. And that's an utterly preposterous claim. Dawkins defeated it in advance 25 years ago with with his discussion of the ""methinks it is like a weasel"" program in The Blind Watchmaker . At every single step, any beneficial random mutation will be preserved and/or promoted by non-random natural selection. The final outcome -- which can only be described as ""final"" with hindsight -- is the result of a whole sequence of mutations and selections occurring over vast stretches of time with huge numbers of generations. Ah, so evolution does ""produce"" after all!... And indeed it does, with precision. It isn't just ""anything,"" as you note. Behe, however, is claiming that evolution cannot be productive, at least at the level of biochemical pathways and cellular ultrastructure. And I repeat that this is not true. Mutations are always constrained by real circumstances. If you want to claim that there is no limitation, fine, in an abstract logical sense, there is none. But I'm not talking about speculative metaphysics. I'm talking about real material genes, subject to real material conditions around them. There are only so many ways a given gene can actually mutate. Sorry, but it's not. Evolution in general just means change in allele frequencies in a population over time. Many such changes are adaptive, in that they have a bearing on the fitness of the members of the population; these changes are where natural selection is relevant. But not all changes in allele frequency are adaptive. They're evolution, just not adaptive evolution. If you have a problem with calling genetic drift ""evolution""... well, this does seem to be about semantics, at times.... What does this even mean? That evolution is somehow supposed to explain why a mutation occurred as it did, and was subject to the selective conditions that it was? I'm sorry, Freedom, but I just don't see what you're even demanding of evolution. What should it explain that it fails to explain? As I've already said, explaining mutations is a task for genetics. Explaining how selective conditions affect mutations is a task for evolution. Not sure what the problem is. And as far as I am concerned you completely misunderstand how natural selection works. There is no claim at any point in what I wrote that natural selection is working on anything that does not yet exist. Mutation A occurs, and natural selection can act on its product(s). If it gets preserved, for whatever reason, then when mutation B occurs, natural selection can act on its product(s), too -- and on the combination of its product(s) and A's. And when mutation C occurs... and so on and so on. The odds against mutations A, and B, and C, and D, E, F, ..., Z all occurring in one fell swoop are astronomically high, especially if the idea is that their end result is selectively beneficial. The odds of A occurring at one time and being beneficial, however, are much better. Still small, but over enough generations, quite likely. If it occurs, then natural selection kicks in, preserving and spreading it through the population over time, if it's beneficial. And once that happens, A is no long merely a possibility whose odds of occurring are relevant any longer: it's a fact with probability 1/1. It is against this backdrop that we must then consider the odds of B occurring. This is again going to be a small probability, but as with A, over enough generations, the odds are surprisingly good. If B occurs, then natural selection again kicks in, preserving and spreading it if beneficial. Odds now no longer relevant: it's a fact with probability 1/1. Consider this against C. It is always possible for a further mutation to come along and undo A and its benefit. If such a mutation occurs, however, natural selection once again kicks in. If A is indeed beneficial, then there will be selection against mutations that undo it, and they'll get purged from the gene pool, often quite hastily. This is just the standard evolutionary account of how random mutation and natural selection work together over time to produce complex adaptations in whole species of organisms. It does not presume (b), i.e., that natural selection can operate on something that doesn't even exist yet. In each case, the mutation must happen first in order for natural selection to begin. To say otherwise is a patently absurd misrepresentation of the entire model. I repeat that I think your characterizations of what does or doesn't qualify as a ""novel function"" are completely arbitrary. You provide no rationale, just a declaration that my characterization is sad. And I am going to say this as many times as necessary in this string: Your use of ""novel function"" is totally arbitrary. This just recapitulates the problem in terms of a distinction between function and application. Are herbivory and carnivory functions, or just applications of the function of heterotrophy? Are heterotrophy and autotrophy functions, or just applications of the function of producing organic compounds? I don't think this distinction, as you've drawn it, holds up to an ounce of scrutiny. I would say that if the members of species can't do x, but then some individual member of the species gains the ability to do x, then x represents a quite ""novel function"" with respect to that species. Natural selection alters the odds, according to exactly the model laid out a few paragraphs above. You don't just multiply all these improbabilities against each other and wind up with an impossibly improbable event. You take an improbable event, select for it once it occurs so that it goes from improbable to normal, and then repeat. The odds calculations don't work anything like you seem to think they do. Not true, for exactly the reasons outline above. The mutations do get selected, just not according to what their ""final"" product will be. To wit: Suppose, for simplicity, that a flagellum needs mutations A, B, and C to occur. Until A, B, and C have all occurred, there is indeed no selection on a flagellum. But if mutation A occurs, while B and C have not yet, there can certainly be selection for whatever A's own benefits are. Then, if and when B occurs, there can be selection for B's benefits, as well as for any benefits that might accrue to A+B. And if and when C occurs, there can be selection for C's benefits, as well as for any benefits from A+C, from B+C, or from A+B+C. It is certainly possible that, prior to A+B+C's existence, there is already a selective condition that would make having a flagellum an advantage. But to say that a selective condition already obtains is not the same as saying that natural selection is already operating. If the relevant mutations don't occur, then whatever the conditions, there's nothing for them to work on. I repeat: I do not know of any evolutionary biologist who has said otherwise. I do not even know of any anti-IC poster on this board who has said otherwise. In my view, the fact that you think people are saying otherwise indicates a serious misunderstanding on your part. It in no way indicates a problem with evolutionary theory or the critique of IC. But Freedom, each mutation in the string is selected!!! Please note: they are only selected after they occur, not before. This is why it is illegitimate to lump them as simply "" a mutation."" You can't collapse time like that! Each mutation in the string must be selected on its own merits or on the merits of how it works in combination with previously selected mutations. Sorry, but again, the selection events are not irrelevant. They have a huge effect on how the probabilities work, whether you and Behe like it or not. Meaningless? Pshaw. The sequences of random mutations and non-random selection events is precisely what renders evolution meaningful. You are the one ignoring the selection events as irrelevant and then collapsing whole sequences of mutations into ""a mutation."" If anything qualifies as ""spontaneous generation,"" that's it. Ridiculous. All you've done above is taken an entire sequence, cut out the half that is selection, and then condensed it into ""a mutation."" IC is completely atemporal. Your own unwillingness to consider sequences of mutations as sequences, as you did above, is a perfect demonstration. Like it or not, that's the general definition. Some of those changes are adaptive, and some aren't. Both are evolution. If you think genetic drift is a crock, then I welcome your careful analysis of why. Really?

Once the spiral arms formed gravity would stabilize their shapes by pulling odd stars back. At the edges where the gravitational pull of the center is much weaker the pull of nearby stars could well be more massive than that of the galaxy center, meaning the stars there are more like the end of a rope. Stars in the center are more dominated by central gravity. Also remember the scale of the objects, even if our galaxy was for sure 20billion years old that would only mean 80 revolutions, which means you can't really claim end state behavior. 1. All that has exploded has not been observed 2. Super novas as the brilliant structures of hot gas don't stay that way forever, they cool and turn into dust clouds, dust clouds which we see everywhere. Perhaps that was because of it's position relative to earth. If a predominantly red gas was inbetween us and the white light... Apparently the moons of jupiter are sacrificing orbital potential energy to heat energy in a system of tidal gravitational cycles which keep the moons hot. I would have to see the data. Why are we assuming the rate of change is constant? Because there are still comet producing events. The life expectancy of a comet is not a hard number like that it depends on how big it is and where it's been, stars are what cause the tails. So I guess gods going to kill us in a 100 years by radiation?

Freedom, yes every supernova has not been observed and supernova explosions don't stay that way forever, but the amount of observable supernova should be far, far greater than it is. 3. Your link's only plausible explanation is that everyone saw it on the horizon and made it look red ,and that is a huge assumption. And what about the ones that did see it red? Where they all wrong? It would not prove that God made everything, but it would prove that it does not take 100,000 years for stars to evolve. Freedom, if their was a red star in between it, where did it go? 4. Because Stonewall, according to the laws of Thermodynamics objects lose energy. By now the Earth's molten core should be cool by now (and Ganymede' should too even with the sacrificing of orbital potential energy ) if the solar system is billions of years old. 5.

Yes Freedom I was assuming the rate was constant, and I gave you the max distance from the Earth with it, but if you don't want to to assume the rate was constant the according to the laws of Thermodynamics objects lose energy, so the moon would have been traveling even faster away from the Earth, meaning that it would be in the Earth at the minimum distanced. 7.

You need to show that supernova's occur (within detectable distance) at a known rate. This is important because the bright flashes which indicate a super-nova anywhere, even in other galaxies do not necessarily constitute the gas clouds we can see; the stellar clusters in other regions of space in other galaxies and even our own could be much more prone to super nova due to their age or composition. Then you need to establish how fast they cool, which again is not necessarily constant; the famous supernova they show you at the observatory could be young or they could be from very large heavy super nova with lots of thermal inertia. Only with both the local(observation range for the gas clouds) explosion rate and cooling time could you predict how many clouds would still be glowing at any given time. Since you say this number is greater than expected I suppose you have the data I have mentioned. Our system is moving and so are other objects in our galaxy. Such an alignment is no more permanent than mars and Jupiter appearing in the same sky. I hope you realize it was just a hypothesis. I did not say red star I said red gas, an object the size of a star would have the most appalling odds of ever eclipsing another star much less for any significant time. I heard that there was excessive nuclear decay in earths core, and again you will have to demonstrate that gravitational tides aren't 'good enough' for Ganymede. Wait, so you are saying that if the rate isn't constant it's increasing? If that is the cause then it follows it could have a root or a constant asymptote much later than 1.3 billion years ago. I don't want to go down that road however because I still have not heard your explaination for this effect, what does the loss of energy have to do with anything? It also states that object may gain energy if another object transfers it. You are not applying the laws correctly if you think it means every phenomenon slowly decays to zero. You can have two completly dead hulks orbiting each other forever in space without ever losing any of the potential energy between them. Why can't it be both? A trend of longer days is not inconsistent because 24 hours is greater than both those points. Why don't you pick a patch of windy ground, and dump 10 tons of dry sand on it. I assure you that if it wasn't desert it won't become desert just because you did that. A desert isn't defined by sand or wind but a lack of moisture. No moisture leads to no or few plants, no or few plants means no top soil which means dust and sand due to wind. You are basically identifying a result of a desert as it's cause. Now in the Sahara there is too much sand to shake a stick at and you do see it burying previously 'nice' places, but they are equivalent to a square mm in the example above, if a bad sandstorm hit the Nile the Nile would simply wash the sand out to sea and if you look at the size of the underwater sand back in the mediterranean you might suspect that has happened.
