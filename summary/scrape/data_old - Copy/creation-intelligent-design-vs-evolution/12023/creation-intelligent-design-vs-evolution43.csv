You by this admission have excommunicated your beliefs from reason and science and that is as it should be. Whether you admit it or not any attempt at rational defense of creationism must be made on a different premise, namely that it can be explained and you are explaining it. It is precisely because God is an explanation to existance that so many believe in him. To say he is inexplicable is the fundamental contradiction which necessitates faith and establishes faith as a virtue for all following elements.","fartingle","412590","No. My believe has an explanation. God created the earth, He created life, and He continues to have a relationship with those who believe in Him.

Mysticism is the belief system that knowledge can be gained by non-rational means. It may be a contradiction in terms but it is a belief that too many people have and are having. I am not kidding, one must believe something is true in order to carry out a method which is fundamentally dependant on that thing. I find this debate quite pointless even by online forum standards, it is however a good an example of prejudice, several evolutionist took the opposing side to me for no apparent reason. There is no way in hell anyone sane could actually oppose my statement if they knew what it meant. I did not say of I said in. In because rationality is a type of epistemological belief. and that is not what it says in 'simple English'. epistemology - a branch of philosophy that investigates the origin, nature, methods, and limits of human knowledge. rationality - 1. the state or quality of being rational. 2. the possession of reason. 3. agreeableness to reason; reasonableness. 4. the exercise of reason. 5. a reasonable view, practice, etc. reason, philosophy - a. the faculty or power of acquiring intellectual knowledge, either by direct understanding of first principles or by argument. b. the power of intelligent and dispassionate thought, or of conduct influenced by such thought. Believing in rationality in epistemology means: Believing that in the origin, nature, methods, and limits of human knowledge ; only the exercise of the faculty or power of acquiring intellectual knowledge, either by direct understanding of first principles or by argument /||/ the power of intelligent and dispassionate thought, or of conduct influenced by such thought. Since science at a fundamental level is based on the fact that true knowledge is logically obtained science is rational. One must believe that rationality can produce knowledge therefore in order to even consider science as a valid method. Believing anything is a path or source of knowledge is a philosophical belief of the branch epistemology . I agree only to the last. I do not, I have seen what happens to a debate when debaters use the same word with different definitions in their mind. It is as close to utter chaos as any communication can get. I avoid this by stating the definition I am using when I feel there is more than one way to interpret the meaning given the context. This is not inferior to doing the same minus the clarification. I do not pull definitions out of the hat unless I am creating a new phrase to represent a new concept. Yes, I am unrelenting. When I do relent it happens so quickly that no one notices or cares. Well I can't say the same about you, I have no idea what you have been reading but I can understand your posts. He is a relief because he fits your thought pattern about who and what you are arguing against. That you find me hard to understand but not him when he maintains young earth creationism and I do not is solid evidence that a great deal of your interpretation of my posts and others is due to the biases you have established. You look for patterns in other posters and try to categorize them so you know what you are to say to win a debate. It works most of the time because most of the opponents you are likely to encounter are doing much the same thing except on a different side. Once they categorize you and you categorize them you are then free to repeat the same 'party line' that is carried out in a thousand other debates to no avail. This has been in great evidence by the way on several occasions you responded to me assuming things that I did not say (I will find the examples if you request it). I don't believe in irrational evolution which makes me a creationist to you and I don't believe in a mystical God so that makes me an evolutionist and an atheist to fartingle. You have both said things to me that imply a position I do not hold. You seem to have taken the gloves off at this point but I never put them on. Since you are now on the subject of what one thinks of opponent debaters I will tell you that I think you need to be more concerned with understanding the posts you respond to and less concerned about what you can classify your opponent as. It has certainly happened to me that I simply cannot understand what someone else has posted, there are a myriad of possible reasons not the least of which is that people often have unspoken (or typed) thoughts that complete the context of a sentence or phrase. In this case I say something radical like 'I do not understand'. You have correctly noted that I believe that I know what I'm talking about, I know what science is, I know what I am saying, and most unusually I am certain enough about many things to say it to others without fear. You can repeat for eternity that I am ignorant of something, but I will simply ignore you; Just as I would expect to be ignored if I asserted you were incapable of thinking at my level so you cannot understand my posts.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:36 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","642"

Archie and I think EZ take the view that the Universe is about 10000 years old. The discrepancy with the biblical dates are usually fudged with a ""not all generations are listed"" argument. IDers are more rare than YECs though usually drop into the OEC category. I suspect that that's partly due to the churches being more interested in discrediting each other than actually cooperating on anything.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","11:41 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","645"
