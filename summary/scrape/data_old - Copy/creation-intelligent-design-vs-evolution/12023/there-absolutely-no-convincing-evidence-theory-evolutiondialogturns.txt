http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species you can't just do anything your out of control imagination wants, i don't think it's unreasonable to assume that there are limits here in the real world. As for the development of lungs into gills i don't know if it is imposable but does not seam likely. Further their are no examples living or dead of lungs evolving into gills but plenty of examples living and dead of gills becoming lungs.

Oh, yes I forgot if you actually answered my question that would mean you were explaining and we can't let that happen can we. What are you talking about out of control imagination? We don't know what causes advancement so how can we know what it's limits are? What of having lungs and gills? That is because there is more oxygen in the atmosphere than dissolved in water. Aerobic life would have no selection pressure to abandon such a rich source of oxygen that doesn't mean it wouldn't be beneficial to also have access to dissolved oxygen.

If you ask me the definition of a word I would post a link to the word in a dictionary, what's wrong with that? I agree their are factors in the environment which put limits on which way things can go.

I did not ask for the definition I asked about two specific cases. Wikipedia is not a dictionary. You sound like genesis, it doesn't matter what you think 'is needed' natural selection is not an intelligent force prompted out of slumber by the dire upcoming fate of necessity like it is painted. Fish are totally viable, and were totally viable; but that doesn't mean there was not a better form of life that would out compete other fish. Births would be less risky; they could stay underwater longer, which means deeper dives, longer hunts, and better ability to hide if needed. Now when certain amino acids are selected among others for lower nutritional cost this would be a mountain. It is not happening because the system does not exist, not because it would not be advantageous.

Do birds need jet engines? No they don't, but boy it would sure be a tremendous advantage! Evolution is driven by the environment, if a species can reproduce and maintained great enough numbers their would be no pressure from the environment to change. Lots of organisms have not changed since their arrival, what requires them to increase their "performance"?
Turn No:7
Freedom:
Evolution as we know it is driven by benefit that allows for greater reproductive success and that encompasses everything. There is always pressure where there is reproduction and death. Whether anything changes depends not on whether something else would be better but on whether a change was beneficial. So no, you are dead wrong. It doesn't matter how many of a species is flying or running about, if a change is beneficial; say a jet engine. It will be selected.

So you have said. In essence that is IC. If you can give reason why this is an example of ignorance I will take no offense. I have explained to you already that this level of final purpose is not what i mean when I say function. All limbs and digits are merely different shaped versions of each other. The key to recognizing a functional domain is to avoid claiming that function that can be performed inefficiently does not accomplish the function. I can climb a tree now, if was truly a different function I would not be able to. I simply cannot do it better than a chimp. Chimps have refined climbing limbs and I have refined walking limbs. I am sorry it appears I used the '40 of 50' as a reference between eukaryotic rudimentary flagellum and this bacterial syringe. "certain eukariotic flagellum are a more rudimentary version of the bacterial kind. they are missing sometimes up to 40 of the 50 parts of their flagellum and they are still perfectly functional." <-> "this is the one example i gave that is missing 40 of its 50 parts. its missing the hook, tip, junction, filament, and the parts that makes it rotate. it doesnt function the same say as a flagellum does" It is coincidence that the number of missing parts are the same, and when you said you gave the example you meant before this thread? I am still interested in the rudimentary flagellum though. I don't actually see an argument against IC in this post. I reread it and realize I became confused. You equated skin with a membrane but then you stopped talking about the euglena and started on the macro-scopic eye right? "to continue with the eye as you asked, this 'complex of proteins on the cell membrane' ie patch of light sensative skin... no need to complicate things for no reason... Speaking about multi-cellular eye NOW developed a variation to be concave - thus differentiation between light and dark as well as knowing the general direction of which the light source or shadow is coming from. the edges of the skin folded over the opening of the concave structure giving a very blurry image to form on these light sensative cells. liquid and a rudimentary lens formed inside and provided a much clearer image... the process continues." I did not know the single cells could even make use of this information it gets from a light sensitive organelle. Very interesting, do you know what control systems are attached to the input? Actually I just realized there was a chloroplast inside that fellow, it probably knows to swim when there is no light right? Be my guest but this tracing gives you no insight into any evolutionary process it (as far as I can see in all examples) merely sets up decendancy connections. Could you please try to formulate the argumental link between this tracing and the process of evolution? This will help me to understand and respond to you. Databed and peeling were forced to it by my arguments and you probably will be as well if you continue to argue honestly. Uh the guided part is what differentiates it from irrational evolution. but yes I have noticed that effect, it seems most keep the idea of rational evolution in their minds while at the same time assuming the conclusion of irrational evolution. Define 'evolution' and I will use it as you define it. I disagree, as I said it appeared you asserted that all the actual advancements 'developed' by means of 'variation'. Since this is the subject matter it is equivalent to saying "how did it happen? , by the process of it happening". You aren't trying to answer the same questions as I then, you are looking for a time line given the premise that functions spring up by chance and that this need not be explained no matter how many proteins are required. Perhaps your finest If you think that is a pathetic comeback, that's because it is. I am not debating you; you are having some kinda of bizarre grammatical sparing match. As you have completly convinced me of this now I will be ignoring any attempt at it's continuance. I am not sure what you mean. I have not yet seen any true arguments from you yet I thought you were 'setting your pieces up' with this information of proposed IC systems. You asserted that 'tracing' disproves IC but I have not seen support for this nor do I see how it follows myself. The argument was made in the abstract and must be defeated in the abstract. This is true of all arguments even though some are very much example ridden. The first step would be (as it always is) to identify the invalid logic in the argument. You are looking for a fallacy that doesn't exist namely that IC claims that no function has a simpler form. You can disprove a rule with an exception but not an exception with an exception. Behe is to be faulted for not explaining the way he was using the word intermediate but I will define it more explicitly. It is irrelevant that any specific intermediate exists, conceptually you can see it is obvious there can always be an intermediate if you attach no further conditions to that. (even if only a partially constructed system). An intermediate as Behe uses the word is actually a range of genetic change in which n intermediates exist and have identical selection pressure direction (scale does not matter). The ratio between n and the total genetic change is relevant for the odds of spontaneous formation jumps. Nomenclature problems such as this is why I invented (and and condemned for it) a more precise and less cluttered set of terms and rules to analyze systems. Anyway though if I was being paid (moral obligations aside) to defend irrational evolution from IC I think the most promising attack angle would be a co-option tree. A co-option tree is a connection between preexisting functions not on selection pressures but the chance that the pre-exisitng structure is so similar to a novel function that a small mutation 'jumped over' to the novel one. Even then that would be an indirect attack (i.e. it attacks the conclusion that life couldn't have advanced by pure chance by minimizing that chance) (this would be an appeal to odds) As I said I didn't see any. If your argument on a flagellum for example is 'there is a bacterial syringe', of course I am not going to attack that it's a fact. I attacked the implications you claimed that fact had.

Turn No: 2: Bennedict:
ill start with reasons for your ignorance. saying that a feature cannot come about from a similar feature with a different purpose is simply incorrect. almost all of the features in biological systems are an evolved version of a different feature with a different function at some point or another. evolution 101 will tell you this. another thing evolution 101 can tell you is the process in which evolution works - natural selection. ill get back to that. i apologize for the confusion, i said 'certain eukaryotic flagellum'... but then started talking about the syringe missing 40 of 50 parts, but you thought i still meant a flagellum. the argument that the flagellum and syringe use the same set of rings to perform two completely different functions indicates that the syringe is a rudimentary flagellum that performs a different task. so, the flagellum could have easily evolved from the syringe, instead of providing a tool for injection of a virus, providing a mode of efficient transportation. one cell could carry many syringes on it's membrane, but if just one were to evolve into a simple cilia or flagellum, the result would be very very harmful to the host cell. selection pressure would encourage the syringe to evolve into a mechanism for movement, which, with it's rings are capable of doing. like i said, multi-cellular organisms can employ the same type of eyespot that single cellular organisms can, and with multi-celled organisms, the eyespot can become concave, but not so with single-celled. i think the euglena uses chemical reactions in its cytoplasm to provide communication between eyespot and nucleus, all of it's organelles do. its such a simple mechanism that it doesnt need an optic nerve like in a more advanced eye. it most likely knows to swim where it is light, i assume. do you mean using its energy at night time and storing it when its daytime? decendency connections? what more do you need to outline the evolutionary process? by tracing back a feature to earlier evolutionary stages we can see that selection can advance a feature - not necessarily with the same function, but advance it nonetheless. most people think of selection as predator-prey relationships, but selection doesnt necessarily mean just that. for example, lets say an organism has a basic concave eye, but no real predators. it's still able to find food better than it's cousins who have a simple eyespot. if you mean that we have intermediates but not enough of them, we should have a smooth transition from one to the other, that is incorrect. evolution is not smooth or gradual or constant. similarly, not all organisms are in the same stage of development. for example, humans are just as modern as a gobbie, but a gobbie is most likely in a much early evolutionary stage. a link between tracing and evolution is this; that comparing an organism's feature that is in an early stage of development to a different organism's feature, we can see a general progression from more basic forms (early in evolutionary stage) to a more advanced form (late in evolutionary stage) which hints to us that a process of evolution must have taken place in the later, more advanced forms of that feature. the eye is a great example; we can see the nautilis' eye which is in its earlier stages and quite basic compared to the eye of an octopus, and since the two organisms are very similar, we can conclude that the eye of the octopus evolved from a form very similar to that of the more basic nautilis eye. both nautilis and octopus are part of a classificiation of animals called mollusks, and the mollusks are interesting because within that class contains every stage of eye development. snail will have a more basic eye than the nautilis for example, so it can be concluded that the nautilis' eye developed from the more basic and thus earlier in it's developmental stage, snail eye.
Turn No:3
Freedom:
I did not say that. That is an assertion. It is not a rudimentary flagellum, to be flagellum it would have to fit the definition of flagellum. That is an assertion. Wait why would a flagellum be harmful to a cell? I would suspect it's more simple than that, like 'swim when you don't detect light'. A process, not proposed results. how? Remember I predicted that the answer is going to be along the lines of 'well it must have happened' I do not think like most people. The number of 'intermediates' must equal or be greater than the number of selection events. The span between selection events is unguided by definition, therefore if any one of these spans is practically impossible (due to the odds of spontaneous generation) the entire formation is practically impossible. The actual minimum size for this span to be so is insanely small for most populations, 5, 6 base pairs. The is in direct contrast to full guidance, i.e. every mutation was selected for which means many many intermediates. Smooth change implies constant guidance. I am not saying we 'should' have more or less than anything. I am pointing out the process of evolution can never produce any genetic change that evaluates false on the guided mutation test. What we are calling intermediates here are genetic sequences that would cause that test to evaluate true if they are on the interval.

Bennedict:
flagellum are found on almost all viruses, they use the speed of the flagellum to infect a large population of cells. a cell with both a syringe and a flagellum would be really really bad. you skipped replying to my paragraph describing to you exactly the link between tracing back the evolutionary development of a feature and the evolutionary process. the number of intermediates may very well be equal to or greater than the number of selection events. how are we to know about extinct versions of pre-flagellum development other than a small handful of intermediates still observable today? we can however see the intermediates between eyespot and an advanced eye like our own, and there are countless examples surviving today. guided mutation test? theres a freaking test? tell me about this test. youre stepping on dangerous grounds here freedom, if youre going to try and use genetics to argue against evolution, you are about to lose horribly.

Alright so that would be bad for the host organism I get that but wouldn't that be good for the virus? You mean this one? : similarly, not all organisms are in the same stage of development. for example, humans are just as modern as a gobbie, but a gobbie is most likely in a much early evolutionary stage. a link between tracing and evolution is this; that comparing an organism's feature that is in an early stage of development to a different organism's feature, we can see a general progression from more basic forms (early in evolutionary stage) to a more advanced form (late in evolutionary stage) which hints to us that a process of evolution must have taken place in the later, more advanced forms of that feature. the eye is a great example; we can see the nautilis' eye which is in its earlier stages and quite basic compared to the eye of an octopus, and since the two organisms are very similar, we can conclude that the eye of the octopus evolved from a form very similar to that of the more basic nautilis eye. both nautilis and octopus are part of a classificiation of animals called mollusks, and the mollusks are interesting because within that class contains every stage of eye development. snail will have a more basic eye than the nautilis for example, so it can be concluded that the nautilis' eye developed from the more basic and thus earlier in it's developmental stage, snail eye. I do not see the link, you may have to state it in explicit terms. In extreme brief given two sets of genetic code, the number of dissimilar base pairs is called the genetic differential. The entire span of change is called the genetic interval. (any combination of steps to achieve zero differential). The test will evaluate true if any mutation on the interval is selected for due to similarity with the end sequence. It will evaluate false if such a case is absent. The interval is open meaning selection for the start or end is not counted. The slightly longer version is easier to understand and if you don't understand this I can go find it for you. The test may be applied to any two temporal points of the same code and will evaluate correctly. Try to evaluate any single mutation.... Well you can see a single mutation only has the starting code and the ending code, since the interval is open that means there are can be no selection events to consider. It evaluates false i.e. unguided. This should be no surprise because it's obvious natural selection cannot select for a mutation that hasn't happened yet. Consider the code GTATC Suppose GTTGC is a greatly improved function. Suppose GTAGC improves the function as well. Suppose GTTTC is not an improved function. Let's evaluate from GTATC to GTTGC GTAGC improves the function of GTATC so it is selected for, it does not matter that the alterior way was not selected for the definition only requires the existance of selected mutations on the interval. It evaluates true, guided mutation. This means that natural selection caused a definite pattern to emerge from random mutation. I would use not but genetics, it's always best to start at the fundamentals.

Bennedict:
the flagellum would be good for the virus, yes. the link is extremely simple. i dont need to explain it any further than i already have. tracing back a feature to more basic forms gives us a very good representation of what part of the feature evolved first ie retina evolved first in the eye. laying out a timeline of the feature's evolutionary stages is exactly what youve asked - if you understand how selection works, you should be able to see that an upgraded eye will be selected for and we can see a gradual progression. its possible that youre forgetting that not all organisms are in the same developmental stages? you dont need to give me a lesson on genetics, im a university student studying zoology which includes genetics, but anyways. im assuming GTTGC is the offspring of GTATC. are you suggesting that if the third base pair were to mutate, it would have a negative effect but if the fourth were to mutate along with it, it would have a very positive effect? if i understand your test correctly, in saying that, lets say the third base pair were to mutate by itself, it would be selected against and GTTTC would become extinct, still leaving GTATC, but if the fourth base pair were to mutate first, and then the third in the following offspring, creating GTTGC? if so, then that is nothing more than simple natural selection. this guided mutation stuff is, i think an incorrect way in which natural selection works. lets say GTATC has a bunch of offspring, which all have the different intervals which you described. GTTTC would become extinct, GTTGC would prevail over all others, GTAGC and the original parent would have a neutral to slightly positive effect. the fact that GTTGC will begin to appear more often than the others is not what you call guided mutation, its simple natural selection.

Exactly what happened first, a timeline not a process. It is the production of the 'upgrade' that is in question. If it is IC, it was not produced by the process of evolution. I wasn't giving a lesson, I just said I would start at fundamentals which for life is DNA. Descended from, not necessarily the direct offspring. In this example. That would be the scenario yes. Yes exactly, but it puts it in a formula which can be used to define exactly what patterns will be produced by natural selection + random mutation. You describe a general example of natural selection call it simple natural selection and then say it's not guided mutation? The guided mutation test is based upon the premises of natural selection and random mutation. It cannot escape them much less contradict them. Natural selection is guiding mutation. That is what is meant.

Bennedict:
please dont make me explain the process of selection to you. if youre debating against evolution, you should have a very good understanding of how selection works as a prerequisite. and besides, i know that you know how selection works, so apply that to gradually changing the eye to a more favorable outcome, and you have your answer. we already have a formula for the predicting the genetic outcome of natural selection, its called genetic drift, and with the example you gave, that is exactly what genetic drift is. this is the first ive heard of guided mutation, you came up with the term, right? i think you may be misleading people by coining the term 'guided'. regardless, its the same as genetic drift.
Turn No:9
Freedom:
I won't Yes Gradually changing under what selection pressure? You said evolution relies on the concept of time, and you are absolutely correct, you must always consider the state of affairs at the time of proposed evolution the past and future are irrelevant, only what can produce benefit for the organism right then and there. I thought genetic drift referred the the accumulation of neutral mutations in a species. The adjective 'drift' is like drifting on the water as opposed to the directed force of a sail or motor. Yes. Perhaps but I could think of no better term. I was calling it guided selection but that doesn't make sense. The essence of the term is giving a namespace to the combined effect of natural selection + random mutation. Obviously this is the proposed mechanism of evolution but it would hardly do to use that word, especially when I am refering mostly to a test to see if the process is acting or not. The idea is that since evolution predicts a pattern in genetic change what can we use to identify exactly what patterns to expect; well the answer to that is that beneficial mutations are selected for so beneficial change is the meta pattern one would expect. How about more than a single mutation though, how about the accumulation of benefit which is as necessary to evolution as the singular selection? Can one tell what the pattern in multi-mutation (having intermediates) will be? What would you call change that is produced by evolution and change that is not (such as genetic drift)? Well I said since evolution is 'selecting' amongst various mutations (presented to it via individuals) the total change is guided by these selection events. I suppose you could say determined by instead of guided but I still think guided describes it better. I don't think so.
Turn No:10
Bennedict:
the eye would have formed under positive selection pressure. meaning, no specific event needs to take place, per say. what i mean by positive selection pressure is that alleles increase a trait which succeeds instead of alleles decreasing and getting rid of negative traits, leaving only positive traits. the way the eye formed was probably not with negative pressure, seeing as with the progressions of the eye, animals will avoid predators instead of the negative alleles being eaten. genetic drift means a general change in the pattern and prevalence of a given interval in a species undergoing a genetic change. the name implies not a stillness but a movement from one point to another. and with the genetic drift formulas, we can predict the outcome of an interval based on known variations and knowing what they do. which is exactly what you proposed with guided mutation.
Turn No:11

The specific events of the mutations would have to take place and selection events would have to follow. That is apparent.

Don't get too excited, you have thought you found a flaw in my reasoning before only to quit again after a few posts. My post has nothing to do with ID. I maintain that a function could not have developed from a previous function if the keyword developed is meant to mean formed non-randomly as a result of selection pressures. What is claimed to be going on is the spontaneous, unexplained, totally random drunkard walk accident that a sequence is stumbled upon that is capable of performing a novel function. Developed is not the word for this, popped into existance or spontaneous generation is. It has nothing to do with selection or explaination, if I were to write a book about it the first page would read "Variation exists, all functionality comes from the chance that a variation might function". Now don't say something idiotic like "yea that is what evolution is", if that is what evolution is then why is it that whenever any of the 'traditional' IC advocates start talking about the odds immediately as if it should matter natural selection is thrown into their face. 1. There are those who think the type III secretory system evolved from a flagellum, any comments on that? 2. You see it easily? could you give some measurements in genetic differential to back up that gut insticnt? You misunderstand the problem if you think IC prevents development because the 'old' function might be still useful. The IC analysis which I have refined to my guided genetic change test makes it very clear that it doesn't matter a XXXX what the sequence was before. It could be a vestigial useless piece of junk DNA or the crux of the organism, the only difference is the possibility that function can be increased due to similarity with final is if the current is performing the same function. Now what you say is true, if selective pressures are strong keeping a sequence a certain way that would stop it's evolution but that is another layer and certainly not why novelty is a problem. If you insist on invoking co-option for an existing useful function you will have to throw in the random generation of differentiation systems (to build a flagellum one place and a secretory system in another), but compared to the actual fairy dust of the advancement itself that is small change. How optimistic! A novel function was generated by token of it already existing... yea I get it now...

1. no, the type 3 secretory system did not evolve from the flagellum, nor did the flagellum evolve from the type 3. they are both modern systems, and their similarities in structure suggest a common ancestor. my examples were purely hypothetical. 2. no, i cannot substantiate that. it is an opinion of mine. so, like i said earlier, many systems can potentially conduct universal functions, such as the mouse trap example developing the function to swim. i understand that changing from catching mice to squashing grapes is not a change in function, so thats a bad example - maybe a half-co-option, if one exists? - but a mouse trap can do many other things as well. it may be used as an oar if the environment demands it to. so this is a complete change in function (from snapping to water propulsion) without a mutation of any kind.

By definition if there is no change there can be no new function. You are being confused by thinking about how a human might use an object. His change in thoughts alone would count as a mutation.

show me that definition. a human's change in thought is not a genetic mutation. likewise, a universally functional object, like almost all object, ie. mouse trap, needs no genetic mutations in order to perform functions they were not "designed" for (by natural selection). if a change in environment causes a feature to perform a new function that it didnt perform previously, how is this not a new function ? universally functional features often do not perform all of the functions they can possibly do, they focus on a couple, although they can potentially do many others. for example, our hands do many things that involve gripping and poking, that type of thing, but they almost never endeavor to assist in something like walking (directional force + friction = locomotion of the body). however, hypothetically, if the environment demanded our hands to now assist in walking, no genetic mutation is needed in order for them to perform such a task.

That is not a new function, that is a newly useful function. change - to make the form, nature, content, future course, etc., of (something) different from what it is or from what it would be if left alone: to change one's name; to change one's opinion; to change the course of history. new - of recent origin, production, purchase, etc.; having but lately come or been brought into being: a new book. new implies a specific type of change in which something is brought into existance, which is certainly different from when it did not exist. You are again confused, our ability to re purpose our hands to do different things is in itself a function and one far more complex than the limb itself. You are forgetting that like any machines a crucial part of life is control systems. The brains of higher life forms allow on the fly modification of control without mutations, this is not a biological axiom in the least. If the environment changes and a bacteria has a structure that then becomes useful because it can accomplish another function, it by definition had that function for if it didn't no use could be gained from it. By stating that there was no mutation you are insisting that no change in structure occurred which insists that the function existed. It seems to me that you and peeling accuse me of setting up arbitrary concepts because you do so yourself. It is entirely arbitrary to say that function isn't present just because it isn't being used. Natural selection nor any of the relevant concepts 'care' about your interpretation of the existance of a function. All that matters to 'them' is that a structure exists and that it fulfills a function that increases or decreases fitness. On the other hand the observation that a function must be selected based on it's operation follows directly from the connection between a structures function and it's effect on survival, that is not arbitrary.

so, if certain type-3 secretory systems could rotate (via brownian motion), as some of them can , by your logic, this would not be a change in function, thus not co-option; and thus, an evolutionary pathway can be drawn through the functionality of the two mechanisms, which would mean that flagella are not IC.

now youre just being obtuse, not to mention contradictory. my mousetrap is not a co-option, although it changes function, because it already had the potential to perform this function (duh. if it performs a function that it did not previously, that is a co-option. it has nothing to do with what the feature can potentially do previous to the co-option.), whereas the syringe example is also not a co-option, but the fact that it is not only potentially able to perform the new function, but it also does (i thought specifics were not considered - "As many things as a fast triggered snapping action can be useful for." remember? - rotation is rotation. how many things can a rotating secretory system be used for? as many things as a rotating mechanism can be useful for. propulsion is a specific.) makes it somehow different. i would disagree. something is not IC if an evolutionary pathway can be drawn between one thing and another - the basis of the IC argument, afterall is that something performing a function which could not have evolved, as it is too complex. thus, providing an evolutionary pathway would null the basis of the argument. even the fact that it could have evolved in such a way is enough to discount the IC argument, seeing as the argument is an absolute.
Turn No:11
Freedom:
Rofl, powered rotation is powered rotation. A pepple falling from a cliff is not a car wheel spinning. A rotating socket has absolutely no ability to produce propulsion. The argument allows 'cannot' only as final evaluation of the odds. No one can claim something cannot happen unless they put some sort of laws on what sequences mutation can form (which no one has done). However what is very clear after the conclusion of the IC analysis is that natural selection is doing about zero in the way of producing novel systems which means you actually have to start considering the odds (You didn't need to before as natural selection filtered uncertainty to inevitability). It is very easy to say therefore if a system is complex enough the odds are practically impossible. It is even easier to say that the total complexity of all life is several orders of magnitude greater than any individual system. This is fully realized by at least Behe as his second book concentrates entirely on the odds. He wouldn't do that if he thought IC had discarded random formation.

It is beyond sad that evolutionists here can't stay on topic and produce even one straight answer, but instead have to resort to changing the subject, insults and fallacies. Any evolutionists want to explain how the theory isn't complete sci fi? Evolution of a new body part, even a new function will do If you can list it in steps and show direct observation of those steps, that'd be fine too

True, Occam's Razor can also be used to shave down OOI to it's simplest but once you have done that, you don't know where you are or where you go from there. The use of a snowflake (in the preceding post) to exhibit the 'naturalistic' tendencies of nature is, at best, somewhat juvenile. Comparing the result of a drop of H2O when it is frozen, or a film of water on a windshield taking a 'naturalistic' tendency when it freezes? THIS is presented as a naturalistic comparison to OOI?

Turn No: 2: Larni:
A snow flake is not an example of complexity from an un-designed (random) cause?
Turn No:3
Esdraelon:
Of course it is, but you make a colossal stretch when you attempt to associate observable and repeatable although inanimate nature with OOI. The laws of nature govern that processes such as the creation of snowflakes, sic, are endlessly repeated whenever the natural processes are conductive to such creation. 'Life' however, is a paradox, and if you presume to use the snowflake analogy you fall into error as common descent infers that all life came from one single cell, in which life happened by the merest chance. I truly have my doubts that man will ever solve that riddle.
Turn No:4
Larni:
So you say a snow flake can form naturally but life can't? Show me how life cannot form naturally. Or show me an example of designed life by a non human hand. The bottom line is that there is no reason to believe that life needs anything other than nature for it to exist. I'll ask this for the second time: Please explain the reason for life requiring design (aside from personal incredulity).
Turn No:5
Esdraelon:
I believe it is natural that an inanimate object can develop from another inanimate object 'naturally', but whether live matter can develop naturally from inanimate matter is totally begging the question. But it is not up to me to show you. Only in your opinion, and in the opinions of those resistant to any other alternative, I presume? But again, the question is not to be laid at my doorstep, it is upon yours. I have not suggested that life requires ID, only that the mechanics and complexity appear to point in that direction.
Turn No:6
Larni:
How is that not an argument from incredulity?
Turn No:7
Esdraelon:
Duh? Because it is not an 'incredulous' argument, per se, it is simply an argument for what I personally see as, at the very least, having as much credulity as inanimate matter becoming live matter by chance.

you're on the right track; the problem with evolution is that it has no verifiable creator -- the fact is, mutations (which supposedly add new raw material for selection) have never shown to add any new structure or even a new part to any existing structure. It's a sad fact for evos.

obvious_child:
Nice raising the bar. Fallacies are a creationist's best friend. You claimed:"have never shown to add any new structure or even a new part to any existing structure." Now you are changing your argument away from structure as new proteins and especially enzymes (which are proteins) don't count.
Turn No:5
supersport:
first of all, the claim is that random changes in molecules do not produce bodiliy structures. Proteins are molecules and are thus not what I was referring to. Second, there are no new enzymes or new proteins produced by any mutations...and not only that but none of those mutations have been shown to be random. So for all the billions of bodily structures in the world, ToE cannot account for even ONE of them.
Turn No:6
obvious_child:
Since when was evolution defined by the presence of new body parts? Except that proteins are in fact structures and play a huge role in organisms. To deny them as relevant is to essentially say that your body isn't important. Without proteins and their functions, life cannot exist. Incorrect. I provided two links showing that claim you regularly spammed as false. How many times have you been refuted on that? 10? 15? 20? 100?

Perhaps if you read them you could say that. I'll admit they are not specific to that example, but you are fallaciously trying to argue that one represents the whole. The links provided discuss how mutations create new features. That is the overarching issue here. Stop using fallacies when you can't argue your primary points.
