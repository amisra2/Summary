"12-02-2008","12023",6,"CashBurnRate","334263","If all life evolved from a common ancestor, then there should be countless instances of new body parts evolving. Body parts such as eyes, muscle, bone, etc. We have not seen one instance of a new body part evolving in a population in which it has not existed previously. Evolutionists will wave the magic ""time wand"" and simply claim that such a change could never be observed in a few decades. What about fruit flies? One generation of fruit flies = around a day. Fruit flies were exposed to x rays to speed up mutation rates, we have observed the equivalent of millions of years (in terms of human generations) of super-accelerated mutation and.... no new body parts. Evolutionists will also list in steps how a new body part can arise. This is only plausible if each of those steps could be directly observed. If not, then it is nothing more than science fiction. Evolutionists have been searching for any direct evidence of the theory of evolution since the 1800's. They are still looking.","supersport","335141","you're on the right track; the problem with evolution is that it has no verifiable creator -- the fact is, mutations (which supposedly add new raw material for selection) have never shown to add any new structure or even a new part to any existing structure.

A basic freshmen tool for teaching is the phrase ""structure defines function."" ""refuted?"" O'rly? First they start off defining evolution as ""moleclues to man"" despite what evolution actually states. That further proves my point about strawman. They don't discuss what evolution actually is. Furthermore, the whole notion that increasing capacity and adaption is not increasing complexity is insane. If I take a simple structure, modify it to form something more complex, is that not a change in complexity? The whole idea that modifying DNA, changing it, removing and adding isn't actually changing anything is retarded. And they are separating macro from micro. That's an invalid argument given that macro is nothing more then the aggregate of micro. A billion tiny changes makes a few large ones. The second idiotic article cites Natural genetic engineering. Despite there being absolutely no evidence of this occuring anywhere.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","90"
