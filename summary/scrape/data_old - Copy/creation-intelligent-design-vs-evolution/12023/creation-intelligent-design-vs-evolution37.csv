I claim that your definition is accurate but incomplete - it covers some atheists, but not all. You are saying (by implication, at least; you haven't responded to any of my arguments with anything other than blanket denial) that my definition is straight-up wrong. Furthermore, there's no 'just' about it - I have provided a considerable amount of references and arguments, where as all you have done is repeat the refuted one-liner over and over again, to the extent where I'm starting to suspect that you are deliberately trolling. It's not making it more complicated, it's making it more precise. You can be an agnostic theist , therefore to simply call someone an 'agnostic' is not precise, and to call someone 'not an atheist' based on this is woefully inaccurate. In what way is it a false analogy? Again, a blanket denial with no substance to back it up.","gansao","392085","An agnostic is someone skeptical about the existence of God but does not profess true atheism That is a perfectly acceptable definition of Accipiter . Not An Athiest who is someone who denies the existence of God. That was my point and I see no reason to stray or debate these definitions. They are quite adequate. Neither do I want to indulge you in an exercise in splitting hairs. The definitions are adequate, your verbiage only serves you, it does nothing to enhance the point or make it any clearer.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","04:13 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","541"
"02-23-2010","12023",37,"iangb","392095","They are inadequate because, as explained above, they do not explain whether the skeptic actually believes in a God or not. As I've linked to, you can have both agnostic theists and agnostic atheists - there is a definite distinction between the two, which you do not provide. Furthermore, your use of the definitions is inaccurate - and seeing it was that which set the whole thing off, it would certainly be relevant. That something has a definition means that the something can match that specific definition, not that it always does match only that specific definition. An atheist 'can' be someone who denies the existence of God - neither Accipter or I are that kind of atheist. That doesn't mean we aren't a different kind - an agnostic kind.","gansao","392097","You are both agnostic..deal with it","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","04:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","543"
"02-23-2010","12023",37,"iangb","392099","And we are also both atheists. I can deal with both of those - so far, you've only shown that you can deal with one. EDIT: Would you say that there is a difference between an agnostic who believes in God and an agnostic who doesn't?","gansao","392101","You think you are an atheist but you are an agnostic An agnostic is someone skeptical about the existence of God but does not profess true atheism I'll repeat the definition of an agnostic and let you decide","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","04:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","545"
"02-23-2010","12023",37,"iangb","392108","Just as with 'atheism', you miss out all the other uses of the word 'agnostic'. Agnostic : a person who denies or doubts the possibility of ultimate knowledge in some area of study. or even better: Agnostic: One who believes that it is impossible to know whether there is a God. I am an agnostic atheist. I doubt that I will ever know for sure if God exists or not, and I do not have faith. Just because you chose to hold one definition sacred does not mean that others do not exist.","gansao","392111","You are an agnostic, call yourself what you want, call yourself Kevin if you want but you are still an agnostic.....

'Agnostic' and 'atheist' are not mutually exclusive, and talk about two different facets of belief - the nature of the belief, and the confidence someone has in that nature. I am an agnostic atheist. You can simplify that down to 'agnostic' if you want to, it will still be accurate, if incomplete. However, it won't change the fact that I am also an atheist.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","04:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","548"

You can simplify that down to 'agnostic' if you want to, it will still be accurate, if incomplete. However, it won't change the fact that I am also an atheist. Philosophers such as Antony Flew,[33] Michael Martin,[25] and William L. Rowe[34] have contrasted strong (positive) atheism with weak (negative) atheism. Strong atheism is the explicit affirmation that gods do not exist. Weak atheism includes all other forms of non-theism. ... Under this demarcation of atheism, most agnostics qualify as weak atheists.","Another opinion","392117","I'm jumping in mid-debate here, without having read most of the thread, since I am puzzled by you calling yourself an agnostic atheist. My understanding of agnosticism and atheism is that an agnostic claims that one cannot claim certainty about, usually, the supernatural since we simply cannot know for certain, whereas atheists claim certainty that the supernatural does not exist. Certainty and uncertainty are mutually contradictory. If you believe that the supernatural does not exist but you do not claim certainty in that belief, then you would be solidly in the agnostic camp, not the atheist camp. --- on edit --- I think that part of the confusion seems to come from there being multiple definitions of the word atheism. I have usually heard the term ""atheist"" in the context of those who claim with certainty that the supernatural does not exist. However, after having looked it up on Wikipedia, it seems that the broader definition also includes those who do not claim certainty. From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism : Given that broader definition, I would agree that you are not necessarily being contradictory by calling yourself an agnostic atheist.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","549"

My first real post on this topic sums it up best, I think. You're quite right that atheism is often described as 'the belief in no God' - but that is only a subset of atheism in general, which is simply a lack of theism - 'no belief in God' would be the catch-all phrase. See Wikipedia's cite notes on the matter. Hence you can have 'strong' (gnostic) atheism and 'weak' (agnostic) atheism. (A)gnosticism, on the other hand, is the descriptor that deals with certainty. A gnostic is certain, and an agnostic is uncertain. Hence you can have agnostic atheists and agnostic theists - stick both into google/wikipedia for the relevant info to highlight the differences between the two. EDIT: You beat me to it. Thanks for taking the time. Does this count as a retraction on 'you are not an atheist', or are you simply being obtuse for the sake of it?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:23 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","551"
