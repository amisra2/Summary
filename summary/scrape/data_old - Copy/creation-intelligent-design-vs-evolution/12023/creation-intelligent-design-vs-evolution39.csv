You either know that's not true and are lying or you are ignorant of it in which case it is unlikely that repeating myself would help. Common descent only means common descent, it neccesarily means increasing complexity and advancement in genes through time inherited. If that is evolution, why can't the theory explain that advancement? Evolution in the sense you speak of is best described as an extrapolation, given common descent, mutation, and natural selection we can probably conclude that all life evolved from simple forms. You cannot yet add ""but we have an idea as to how that would happen"" and so consequently you cannot call it a scientific theory and you cannot teach it as fact. Heliocentrism is a good analogy because it's a hypothesis that matches observed data but does not explain itself that is how you know it is not scientific fact. What good is a theory that says that the light we see comes from the sun if it does not propose that light is a ray that can travel through space from the sun to earth? What good is a theory that says life advanced from the simplest cell if it does not propose the mechanism of such advancement? If I did that to you, you would be furious at me.","Databed","392165","No, I say, ""You're wrong and this is why."" Take the post I am responding to now - where is any reply to what I actually posted. Again, I challenge you to show how ERV's in our genome don't prove evolution to be true. What are you saying here? Are you saying that evolution doesn't address increasing complexity in the genome of a population? Have you lost your mind? I am less and less impressed with your ability to reason and am starting to believe that you're not worth my time. That is a prediction of evolution. It is also a prediction of a simple extrapolation of the fossil record to a time before life was being fossilized. Really? I am wasting my time. Um, we knew light came from the sun before we knew what light was. We still don't fully understand light. So, does that mean that we can't say light comes from the sun? Since we don't fully understand the nature of matter can we not say lead is denser than hydrogen? You really need to educate yourself. I'm just very tired of having to respond to 29 different one sentence quotes. Can't you just place your argument within a single response? I can understand calling out quotes from me when I make some outlandish claim or insult, but having to try to reassemble a very dissected argument gets annoying. Do you do this because you have trouble forming ideas in context of our discussion?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:32 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","571"

Same here I know If you are just going to ignore what I have said on purpose I agree. You cannot say you can explain it. You really need to have an open mind. I have before, I am don't think dragging a statement on with extraneous language is necessary and I won't be judged on length, as for the line by line responses I respond to each block of meaning, it would make no sense if I did it as a paragraph at the end. Then don't spread out the subjects of your post, we could do 1 to 1. I don't ignore things on the assumption that you put them in your post for a reason, if you want to begin this respond only to whatever in this post you see as the subject. I do this because it is clear. I have stated my argument simply before, I have defended it from attack. I don't think you missed that so I will help you out some, you argue against my rebuttal now, is it irrelevant? why? you don't just pretend I never said it.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","10:21 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","574"

You have already stated that you cannot point to an example of IC so the 'problems' you highlight for evolution are not in fact problems at all. Mutation and NS has been explained on this thread but just to go over it one more time: Mutations abound. The ones which reduce fitness reduce reproductive capacity of that lineage and it is out competed to extinction. That's it.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:59 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","576"

But not proof.","Databed","392218","It is proof unless you consider God created us in our current state to make it look like things were going on in a nonexistent past, i.e. mutations resulting in separation of species. Much like Archie's argument that God created light already on its way to Earth containing information from events like quasars and supernovae. If this light we see doesn't prove that the world is older than six thousand years, then on the same note, ERV's in our genome don't prove evolution.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:12 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","577"
"02-24-2010","12023",39,"None","None","None","Larni","392219","All I'm saying is that we never have perfect information and have to be tentative in our conclusions. Don't get me wrong; I think that ToE is correct and that there is no supernatural man in the sky with magical powers running the show. But to be true to the scientific methodology I can't say I 'know for sure'. That would be moving away from an evidence based conclusion. You only have proof in maths and formal logic. Until something comes along to challenge ToE I will continue to believe it to be true, but I accept the fact that we could have missed something; I don't believe we have but there is an outside chance that we have. As there is no evidence for design I don't believe our universe was designed. It is a conclusion that could be right but as there is no evidence of it there is no need to consider it. Just like there is no evidence for his Noodley Majesty the FSM.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:32 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","578"

Gene duplication is a powerful driving force in evolution. Edit to add: I just ran across this article on the evolution of biological complexity: http://www.pnas.org/content/97/9/4463.full I haven't had time read it in its entirety, but thought I'd toss it into the mix ....","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","11:01 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","579"

It seems that you are refuting your own understanding of evolution, not what the experts have defined. Maybe your definition of evolution doesn't stand up to your scrutiny, but mine certainly does. Now, will you please tell me how the ERV's we find in our genome, along with that all primates, necessarily means common descent but not evolution. You said this, not me. Can you please back it up with something?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","01:51 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","581"
