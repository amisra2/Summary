You know if I agreed to that I would not have said what I said. As I have invited others I invite you to make an argument against IC. I will attack unsound logic, even when it is meant to defend something true or attack something false. No, have you read my posts yet? I blame you, if you are calling me a liar I will create a thread in the liars corner. Yet you still have not been able to point out a single example of my ignorance manifesting itself in a misconception about either irrational or rational evolution. I am sure that mere differentiation irks you but since I defined both and you had nothing to say about both I will designate my claimed ignorance to be conjecture. This is I think the third time you claimed I was ignorant of evolution when pressed with the mentioning of the topic of IC. You may ask databed and peeling and they will tell you I do not alter my position as a result of such claims. So you have read that book, excellent. If you are able to say 'evolution completly kills it' you must have found the argument to defeat IC. Is it so extensive you cannot post it? a.k.a ""Yes"".","Bennedict","413008","i am so overjoyous that youve asked me why IC is wrong. lets start with the eyeball: ID proponents bring up the eyeball as evidence of irriducible complexity, yet we have a very good evolutionary explanation for the complexity of the eye. a patch of skin on a single celled eukaryotic organism developed a variation which enabled the differentiation between light and dark - thus being able to avoid dangers slightly and survive longer. an example of this sort of eye is the euglena bacterium. a rudimentary eye formed through natural selection, one like that of a nautilis. the evolution of the eye continued to a complex eye that we humans have and many other animals. so, the eyeball can be reduced to a simpler form, it is not irriducibly complex. another example used by the ID proponents is the infamous bacterial flagellum. Behe proposed that there is nothing like the bacterial flagellum, and even without one part of the flagellum, the mechanism would not work. certain eukariotic flagellum are a more rudimentary version of the bacterial kind. they are missing sometimes up to 40 of the 50 parts of their flagellum and they are still perfectly functional. there is a heirarchy between flagellum that one can trace back in the evolution of the organelle. the bacterial flagellum is actually a very good example of evolution taking place, because we have many varieties of the flagellum organelle in specimens. the bacterial flagellum is not irriducibly complex in that we can trace back it's evolutionary roots. a radio interview with a fellow from the discovery institute said that the whale's blowhole has not been traced back to the lungs of land dwelling creatures, hence IC. in fact, we have an excellent understanding of records depicting the esophogus moving up to the top of the head in mammals. the respiratory system of whales can be reduced to land dwelling mammals, thus it is not irriducibly complex. the immune system has been heavily documented in it's evolution, yet ID proponents like Behe describe the immune system as being irriducibly complex. first of all, it should be noted that the immune system is genetic, so it could get highly technical. i will try to keep things simple. the vertibrate immune system evolved first from the immune system from invertibrate species - thus both systems are different. vertibrate immune systems developed first from the clumping of genes called major histocompatibily complex genes (MHC). MHC genes come in two versions, the first being for fish and the second being for mammals. selection pressure encouraged the development of auto-immunity from these MHC and other genes (TAP/LMP etc). MHC promotes immune reactions within cells, and its also used to control these reactions. these combined clumps of genes encouraged the production of hormones which produce a group of proteins called cytokines which are created by cells, used sort of like an enzyme, but to provide communication between cells. this means that cells which hold an immunity to a certain virus can transmit that immunity information to other cells. over time, a large amount of these cytokines can be produced by cells which hold an immunity. the vertibrate immunity system can be traced back to a simpler immunity system, thus meaning it is not irriducibly complex. i think that just about covers every one of the IC arguments, if you have any other propositions, dont hesitate to ask me or make a thread and get a number of answers.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","06:37 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","662"

"09-20-2010","12023",45,"Freedom","413031","Excepting science not being a system, the second statement and the first statement seem to contradict each other. Do you mean: "" If science was a belief system then it would need to be a system that you believe in to be true "" ? I am overjoyed that you seem willing to argue it instead of dismiss it. Mistake number one on the topic of IC is mistaking it for a unprovisional conclusion. Nothing in science is without provisions and IC is no exception. IC does not claim that something cannot happen it claims that it cannot be produced by a process. The point being that 'a very good evolutionary explanation' is not so unless all selection pressures are identified. What these 'very good evolutionary explanations' tend to be are evolutionary stories. There is the belief (or thought) amongst evolutionist that if they can imagine a series of steps that is an explanation. These stories tend to contain two elements, a proposed intermediate and the reason it would be beneficial to an organism. On the surface this is all that should be required but the IC analysis reveals that the final selection pressure does not equal the process selection pressure. Evolution as Darwin put forth was gradual with practically an unlimited number of intermediates (Here I just made a statement about evolution as Darwin put forth which means if I haven't read OOS and this is my ignorance you should point it out) and IC in essence shows that evolution does not do well when this premise is strayed from. These stories therefore typically have a 'magic transition', I just coined that phrase now but I mean by it the part of the story that actually represents the event which is meant to be explained. The common theme in almost all these stories is that this magic transition is simply an assertion that it happened. Let's look at what you just said for example. ""a patch of skin on a single celled eukaryotic organism developed a variation which enabled the differentiation between light and dark"" The bolded part is evolution, the rest is particular context and good record keeping. The assertion here is that there was a single mutation (variation) that caused this ability to manifest. Since the function forming event is the crux and primary subject of IC it is obvious that this story defeats every attempt at IC analysis because it simply states it away. BTW I assume you mean a protein complex in a cell membrane when you say patch of skin? I see you are starting off with examples and this is good because I have already extensively argued IC vs IE in the abstract with databed and peeling. Therefore making the same arguments with particulars will clarify things for many I think. I thought you said you read his book. Would you care to elaborate on this, what parts are actually missing? Then the fellow from the discovery institute needs to reread the book because IC has nothing to do with tracing. Don't, that will cause confusion. The biggest problem with Behe's book in my opinion was that he used page after page trying to make analogies and simplify concepts for his readers (which I guess were mostly creationist so....) Tracing does not prove IC incorrect, you have confused it for ""there isn't anything like this"" which would be difficult if you read and understood DBB. I am aware genes produce functions. Another side note you said mammals and fish, aren't you missing reptiles and birds because I am sure they are not invulnerable to infection by virtue of God's grace. Actually the abstract argument covered them all, but it will be interesting to apply.","Bennedict","413053","yes, i was overjoyous but ashamed because as i said in another thread, people who value science should be ignoring ID. but whatever, you asked. i assume you are referring to Darwin's tree of life, where the lines are straight. we have found that evolution is not a ramp from one species to another, but a staircase with intermediates on each step. the reason is because each step is going to be better at surviving than the previous one. in a ramp illustration, the process would be unstable, but in the way evolution works, a species is maintained for a while before a variation arises and after maybe a couple decades the entire species has developed this feature. also, if Darwin's tree of life were correct, we would see one species branching off into a million different directions, seeing as different variations arise that may all be an advancement. so to continue with the eye as you asked, this 'complex of proteins on the cell membrane' ie patch of light sensative skin... no need to complicate things for no reason... developed a variation to be concave - thus differentiation between light and dark as well as knowing the general direction of which the light source or shadow is coming from. the edges of the skin folded over the opening of the concave structure giving a very blurry image to form on these light sensative cells. liquid and a rudimentary lens formed inside and provided a much clearer image... the process continues. IC can be disproven by tracing back the evolutionary process. you said yourself that the IC argument is that certain things could not have come about by a process, but as ive shown you, we can trace back the process of the evolution of the eye to more basic forms - thus IC is wrong in saying that the eye did not form by a process. thank you for asking about the flagellum. the flagellum evolved from something called a bacterial syringe: this is the one example i gave that is missing 40 of its 50 parts. its missing the hook, tip, junction, filament, and the parts that makes it rotate. it doesnt function the same say as a flagellum does, but the flagellum can be reduced to it. there are also intermediates, like the cilia; the flagellum rotates in a circular patter whereas a cilia moves back and forth. it isnt missing 40 parts, but it is still missing parts of which Behe says are essential to function, yet the cilia and the bacterial syringe are perfectly functional. i suggest researching Ken Miller's explanation of the evolution of the bacterial flagellum. simplicity does not cause confusion, freedom. we use simplicity to avoid confusion. what Behe did was make tangents. the mouse trap analogy is just silly. i agree, Behe made things complicated in his book, but not for describing things in simple terms. reptiles and birds would fall into the MHC class 2 with mammals. i was giving examples of both in saying fish and mammals. if we trace back the evolutionary process of these systems, we can see that they can be broken down into other simpler mechanisms, and that disproves IC which states, as you put it, that evolution could not have caused the development of such complex systems. from what ive seen, the argument is one of two - that either there are no intermediates, like the eyeball which is incorrect, or that if you remove one part, the system is completely non functional like the flagellum which is incorrect. the same goes for both examples; there are intermediates between the flagellum and the bacterial syringe, and if you remove one part of the eye, it is still functional.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:09 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","665"

'does not make science a belief system.' = 'Not a belief system'. Then the first statement says A IS B and the second is B IS NOT A Unfortunately identity is commutative. (the scope here the domain of the word 'science') Do you realize how rare formal logic fallacies are? Then I regret to inform you I don't know what you meant because you used the word 'need' in a vacuum. Need for what? Indeed. Which as far as I am concerned can only be caused by three possible scenarios. 1. We are not using the same meaning for the phrase belief system, or even the word belief. 2. You are deliberately playing mind games for some alterior motive. 3. You haven't a clue what I am saying and are merely contradicting me on the premise that if I think it, it's wrong. If you were content with ignoring criticism of irrational evolution you wouldn't have signed up on a political debate forum and proceed to post in threads on the topic. That point is incorrect. Continuous or steady 'progress' from one species to another does not imply that new species will be formed along the way and certainly doesn't imply that new species will survive. Uh maybe we should complicate things for a reason. A cell membrane is not a patch of skin. From this post I am sure you are talking about a multicellular life form even though you said: ""a patch of skin on a single celled eukaryotic organism"" Now, assuming you mean multi-cellular organism you may repeat 'developed a variation' but again since this is the actual process in question it simply isn't helping the way you seem to think it is to repeatedly assert it happened. Except that this action of tracing consists of looking for similarity and telling a story. Bad form for science to be as valid as the imagination of the scientist. I could tell you a story about how flukes evolved from nose muscles, the key to these evolutionary stories is making is sound plausible which is a problem because there is no standard for actual truth in the matter because they proposed explanation does not apply and cannot be checked against the proposed occurrence. No you can identify more basic forms, that does not mean you identified a process it means your mind is conjecting that some occurrence must have happened. Please don't feel offended because this is quite normal. This is in fact exactly why so many evolutionist have thought I was in contradiction accepting common descent without accepting irrational evolution. Common descent says that creatures came from common ancestors, life has advanced so then I must accept that something is causing life to advance over generations. Yes I do, that does not specify what I must accept though, you are basically pointing out 'common descent' for organisms and conjecting that some process must have happened. Ah, here is the good stuff. Another evolutionist (I don't remember who but will look it up) tried to use the secretory system as a proposed precursor as well, as evidence he posted a link to an article discussing the similarities between them. The most interesting thing after reading that article, however; was no the similarities but the fact that the article had good reason to think that the secretory system was a decomposition of the flagellum, i.e. the secratory system evolved from the flagellum. I suspect this circular descendancy comes from that fact that similarity ~~ descent connection but that does not specify the direction so often 'scientist' simply choose which ever happens to be more convenient for their paper. If it does not function ""the same say as a flagellum"". It is not a flaggelum. You may now see the relevance of my opposition to the notion that every biological system is merely a permutation of some other system. On that premise you will be hard pressed to understand IC because you will only see one actual system in life, this blurring is objectively flawed. I have, the video you linked to surmised ken miller's argument precisely I think. Are you suggesting the cilia has any connection with a flagellum besides they do the same thing for the cell? I am not suggesting that one attempts to make things complicated but trying to simplify something beyond the level made possible by the number and the meaning of the terms will omit information and necessarily cause confusion. It does not. Again I have gone through these arguments before on this very forum, since you do not wish to read what I have argued perhaps I should give you a primer. ON TYPES OF SYSTEMS: I concluded all systems in biology are either IC or HIC HIC = hybrid irreducibly complex, meaning as system which contains both necessary parts and unnecessary but merely helpful parts. HIC is a favorite escape for arguing against IC, examples of HIC are given in which the necessary component becomes necessary, it then becomes IC. It is then asserted that since an HIC system can be converted to an IC system and IC system is not IC. The blade cuts both ways though, an IC system may be converted to an HIC system and every system has an IC core which means that all novel function is IC. ON INTERMEDIATES: I made detailed arguments from many directions on the invalidity of association any function with a specific selection pressure. This is the mistake that ken miller made in the video you posted for me, He used Behe's definition of IC which has some terms implied that should not be. Most important of these being when he says 'function' he does not mean any function he means the function of the said system. The ability to decompose a system into systems with different function does not mean the system was not IC because you in fact are not able to remove and of the parts and retain the function, merely a function. Further the ability to compose a system into simpler systems with the same function does not mean the system was never IC, it means it is HIC now. ON GUIDED MUTATION: The tool previously mentioned is a formula for identifying the concept IC is talking about. I do not wish to restate it's definition if you are not interested. I can summarize what it does, it returns a boolean value which is an absolute measure of whether a genetic change is produced by evolution or pure chance. true = guided = the result of natural selection + random mutation = rational evolution. false = unguided = luck = irrational evolutions production of novelty Using this function one can define IC in another way: An IC system is one which returns false when measuring from any previously existing genetic code to the systems minimal functional form (IC core). Since nearly axiomatic that all systems have an IC core the analysis seems silly to take to see if an IC core is IC but it will still return the correct value, it is much more useful to see if a proposed IC system is just IC or HIC. It's primary purpose however is it's extreme convenience at defining the difference between creating an IC system (novel system) and improving an existing one. At the risk of sounding arrogant Behe's book 'the edge of evolution' could be reduced to two pages of explaining this tool and would stand some improvement for the lack of puzzle fitting one would have to do. No intermediates and 'you can't remove a part without removing the function' are equivalent. The eye is a system of compound IC improvements, as opposed to the flagellum which as far as I can tell is actually IC. (or very slightly HIC).","pandion","413134","That's a lot of straws.
