"05-18-2011","12023",51,"CashBurnRate","334263","If all life evolved from a common ancestor, then there should be countless instances of new body parts evolving. Body parts such as eyes, muscle, bone, etc. We have not seen one instance of a new body part evolving in a population in which it has not existed previously. Evolutionists will wave the magic ""time wand"" and simply claim that such a change could never be observed in a few decades. What about fruit flies? One generation of fruit flies = around a day. Fruit flies were exposed to x rays to speed up mutation rates, we have observed the equivalent of millions of years (in terms of human generations) of super-accelerated mutation and.... no new body parts. Evolutionists will also list in steps how a new body part can arise. This is only plausible if each of those steps could be directly observed. If not, then it is nothing more than science fiction. Evolutionists have been searching for any direct evidence of the theory of evolution since the 1800's. They are still looking.","Accipiter","430205","Hears the first post.

I would like to begin by addressing some key points 1) I agree with micro-evolution (adaptation). I do not agree with macro-evolution (the change from one species to another, or more plainly put, the adding of information). However information can be subtracted ex: wolf (canine) domesticated to dog (canine). 2)This is not a debate of science vs religion. This is the debate of the science of one religion vs the science of another religion. Religion by definition is a cause, principle or belief held to with faith or ardor. Science by definition is knowledge attained through study or practice. Because ""macro-evolution"" takes so much time according to evolutionists, and because you cannot observe the past and only the present, you cannot observe ""macro-evolution"" and thus it requires just as much faith as any other religion. 3)No true transitional fossils have been found. And before you people go and use that dinosaur bird against me that is exactly what it is, a dinosaur bird. It is a dinosaur with bird feathers nothing more, nothing less. Continuing with transitional fossils, the odds of a single protein, the most basic unit of life, forming by chance is 1/20^300. That is just a single protein, and a single DNA strand requires thousands. The odds of a new DNA strand forming by chance is 1/10^400,000. Now let me ask you, in all the ""transitional fossils"" we have found they are all perfect, to say, no consistent genetic deformities. How could something with the odds of 1/10^400,000 form on the first and every try? You answer that. 4)Why evolve skeletons? According to evolutionary scientists we started out with exoskeletons similar to insects. Insects are still around and are thriving, so why ""evolve"" something you don't need? Oh and if we are ""evolving"" then every human is ""evolving"" at the same pace with the same mutations, the odds of that are impossible. 5)What is your ultimate authority? A group scientists that are biased, mortal, non-omniscience and fallible, or a supreme being that is unbiased, eternal, omniscience, and infallible aka God of the bible. I welcome any rational response related to this post. Thank you","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:08 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","753"

I advise you to steer away from an information theory perspective. There is much information reflected by natural selection, most of it temporary shifts in environment. A genome could in a very real sense gain gigabytes of data that has nothing to do with any real advance in biological systems. That is not true, a direct observation is not required to make conclusions about something. All history, archeology, paleontology, geology; and even network news agencies would be on unsure footing if conclusions could not be made indirectly. When you read an ancient wall with a dead language you are not observing some ancient event which it records, you are concluding that it is unlikely they made it up. It requires no more faith to believe that something happened when you were not there to see it than it does to believe that the moon is round though all you ever see is a partially shaded disk. Define a true transitional fossil and you will see that the term is inapplicable or most certainly has been found. Evolutionary theory holds that there will be millions of transitional forms, at least one for every selected mutation. How many of those selected mutations do you need to find before you consider it a complete transitional record? Which one? That calculation doesn't seem to follow. If the 20 is meant to be the sequence length it should be a dimensional increase (an exponent). The number of basepairs in the strand determine the number of different combinations that could be had for a sequence that length. If on the other hand 20 is to represent the different types of amino-acids, is 300 meant to mean the length of the polypeptide? If so you must realize that that is not nearly the smallest they can be. I don't think treating the odds in terms of amino acids is a good idea anyway. It assumes mutations happen in the form of codon shifts and they don't need to. I think it generally muddies up the concept. For instance if a sequence was 6 base pairs (2 codons) not including control sections the odds of any given sequence of base pairs is 1/4^6, the odds of any given sequence of codons (aminoacids) is 1/20^2. That is 400 possibilities (codon analysis) vs 4096 possibilities (base pair analysis). Can't you see that the vast difference in possibilities? This is because four values in groups of three can have 64 permutations while 20 in groups of one can only have 20. ""But freedom pretty much all of the 64 codons specify a amino-acid so shouldn't it balance out with the AA view?"" No it shouldn't, because insertions and replacements disrupt the codon pattern. It can change the amino acids until the next intron. In other words the base pair permutation does matter. A strand of DNA doesn't require any proteins but the ones that copy and read it. How can you give a single number for a 'strand' as if it was a standard unit? If they are transitional fossils, they are genetic deformities from their ancestors. What makes you think complete DNA can be extracted from fossils? What are you talking about? There is no only one try, a fatal mutation effects only one organism. I see now what they mean when they say 'why' is not the question. While I asked 'why' to unjustifiably assumed and arbitrary patterns... you ask 'why' to natural selection and mutation. Mutation doesn't answer to why. Natural selection will answer to any benefit whether we think it was needed or not. No, we don't have the same mutations. If evolution was operating on humans as we understand it the people with the favourable mutations will have more kids than those without. Eventually those genes would be prevalent. So the entire species would 'evolve' at one rate. You must realize of course that mutations that are inheritable occur when your organism is constructed, at any other point it would exist in but one cell and have no chance of representing your DNA in the form of gametes. You omit reason. You ask a real scientist, a good scientist and they will not use themselves as the authority for their proclamations. They will say the 'evidence'. It is not truly the evidence alone that they invoke as authority but the premise that through reason there is but one conclusion. That is given the evidence logic has dictated something. (Note when someone can prove something with just logic and no more evidence than a chalk board and notation) If the choice was between reason and an infallible god, I would answer that it matters little which you trust because they must agree. Reason is the essence of truth, the axiom of all facts and before it even the premise of an infallible god must melt away when confronted with contradiction. Yet the choice is not as you presented it even if updated with reason instead of a scientist authority. God is not speaking to me nor to anyone I know about, nor has the claims that god has spoken to them been supported by anyone that has ever existed (to our knowledge). The god you would cite as authority has not the presence of authority to match a meek undergrad doing research in their basement. The bible is no more proof of god than the iliad is proof of Zeus. You have one, and I pray you recognize it for what it is; because you have just made yourself a lighting pole for personal assault by more than a few and you won't get much better.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","01:19 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","755"
