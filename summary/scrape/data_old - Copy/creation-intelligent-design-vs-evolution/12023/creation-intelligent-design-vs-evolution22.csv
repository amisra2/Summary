A species is not as intuitive as one may think. But I am not going into the details of each of the methods of differentiating species. You may do your on research on the four (typology, morphometry, sexual isolation, phylogeny) methods. Humans like to put things in categories (e.g. organisms in categories of species), but nature does not care. Lets look at one method of defining a species. Sexual isolation: organisms that can mate with each other and give viable offspring. We shall ignore hybrids such as mules and ligers. They are usually sterile. There is a particular set of organisms called ring species that allow us to get s snapshot of speciation in action today. I find them fascinating. Think of a straight line as a circle where G connects back to A. (I am not very good with ASCII art so this will have to work. There are excellent examples on the net, just search for ring species. On youtube: search for: Evolution in Action: Ring Species) A B C D E F G A One such ring species is Ensatina eschscholtzii. A group of salamanders that live in the mountains which circle the California Simi Valley. The mountain range splits around the valley. As the salamanders moved south, there was a split in lineage from the parent. Some went on the east side of the valley, some went to the west side of the valley. At the southern end of the valley, the daughters of the salamanders meet after about 10 million year split. However, something strange happened. Imagine A and G are the ones meeting in the southern part of California. Just to keep it simple, I will use A-G instead of their scientific names. Here is the cool thing: 1. A can mate with B 2. B can mate with A and C 3. C can mate with B and D 4. D can mate with C and E 5. E can mate with D and F 6. F can mate with E and G 7. G can mate with F, BUT NOT A Each group looks a little different from the one next to it. And A does not look anything like G! At this moment, they are considered the same species. What happens if B-F goes extinct? We now have two separate species! The ring species causes the evolutionary branching effect on the evolutionary tree. This is one example of evolution in action as predicted by Darwin. Imagine this same process happening for nearly 4 billion years over the entire earth. Mind boggling. I noticed in your post that you are looking for an example of a mammal. I do not know of a present day ring species of a mammal. (But then I am just a little, country boy from Mississippi, not a biologist.) We must rely on other evidence. As one understands how evolution works, you see the overwhelming evidence in fossil record, DNA research, and in speciation with common ancestors. Next post, randomness plays a role in evolution, but is not the driving force.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:52 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","316"

However, one should not expect science to accept an extraordinary magical solution without extraordinary proof. Science is not a religion. It is simply a systematic method of gaining knowledge of the world around us. Science should be taught in science classes. Religion should be Sunday school (or the equivalent). There is even room for religion to be taught in religion, philosophy, possibly history, and/or possibly literature classes. The debate over evolution vs creationism is not a scientific debate.

Intelligent design is metaphysics which belongs in philosophy or in religion class/es or some kind of religion.

Genesis is an inspired poem, and contains truth in its message, but it is pretty obviously a work of poetry, like a song. Look at the repetition, and all the metaphors! Poetry does not imply fiction. THere are many historically valid poems. Plus, when read figuratively, Genesis poses no conflict at all with science. Evolution is not the only science that demonstrates Genesis can not be read literally. What about the speed of light from the stars, geology, genetics, comparative embryology, etc. The only stumbling block between science and faith is a strictly literal interpretation.

Evolution has nothing to do with body parts lying around. Instead of writing an endless dissertation on the facts of science and evolution and ignoring the myths of religion I highly recommend that people look up the Science Club of Long Island. They publish a monthly online magazine called Science and Discovery. The subject of evolution is covered from soup to nuts. In addition as an added benefit they debunk the Bible and prove that Christianity is nothing but a hoax. I suggest everyone explore this site thoroughly.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:09 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","322"
"02-12-2010","12023",22,"CashBurnRate","334263","If all life evolved from a common ancestor, then there should be countless instances of new body parts evolving. Body parts such as eyes, muscle, bone, etc. We have not seen one instance of a new body part evolving in a population in which it has not existed previously. Evolutionists will wave the magic ""time wand"" and simply claim that such a change could never be observed in a few decades. What about fruit flies? One generation of fruit flies = around a day. Fruit flies were exposed to x rays to speed up mutation rates, we have observed the equivalent of millions of years (in terms of human generations) of super-accelerated mutation and.... no new body parts. Evolutionists will also list in steps how a new body part can arise. This is only plausible if each of those steps could be directly observed. If not, then it is nothing more than science fiction. Evolutionists have been searching for any direct evidence of the theory of evolution since the 1800's. They are still looking.","Freedom","390216","What you are talking about is irreducible complexity; it is the only argument against evolution that appears to be totally immune to rebuttal. I have thought this issue is far over debated like gay issues but perhaps that are because I have an objectivist view point. I don't suppose any evolutionist have realized that all the evidence for evolution is also evidence for ID. They often talk about the mountains of irrefutable evidence, but the fact that the sun rose and set every day was evidence for the sun orbiting the earth, but it's also evidence for the earth spinning. Likewise all the evidence for evolution can be condensed into one statement ""life forms are similar to other life forms"", This is predicted by the intelligent design hypothesis as well. Direct evidence for ID that would not support evolution would be irreducibly complex biology, direct evidence for evolution that would not support ID would be more than just adaptation, it would have to be original useful DNA, or a simulation showing that coherent structure can be achieved without intelligent design by randomization and elimination.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","10:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","323"

ToE does not state that ""life forms are similar to each other"". Direct evidence for ID/Creationism has never been established so there is no reason to suppose it to be true. Direct evidence for allele frequency change is freely available for all to see. You also need to define original, useful DNA. 4/10.

No it's not. Perhaps because you don't understand much about evolutionary theory you have confused it with ID. ID is not science and has no evidence to support it. Besides being terribly wrong, that's not evolution and has nothing to do with evolution. Perhaps because you know so little about orbital physics you think that the sun rising and setting is any kind of evidence for the earth orbiting the sun. It isn't. You would have to actually understand a little about it to know that. Nobody, from Copernicus onward, used observations of the revolution of the earth to conclude that the earth was in orbit around the sun.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","01:26 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","327"

""By irreducibly complex I mean a single system which is composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning. An irreducibly complex system cannot be produced directly by slight, successive modifications of a precursor system, because any precursor to an irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is by definition nonfunctional . . . Since natural selection can only choose systems that are already working, then if a biological system cannot be produced gradually it would have to arise as an integrated unit, in one fell swoop, for natural selection to have anything to act on."" ""[S]tructures and processes that are claimed to be irreducibly complex typically are not on closer inspection. For example, it is incorrect to assume that a complex structure or biochemical process can function only if all its components are present and functioning as we see them today. Complex biochemical systems can be built up from simpler systems through natural selection. Thus, the history of a protein can be traced through simpler organisms . . . The evolution of complex molecular systems can occur in several ways. Natural selection can bring together parts of a system for one function at one time and then, at a later time, recombine those parts with other systems of components to produce a system that has a different function. Genes can be duplicated, altered, and then amplified through natural selection. The complex biochemical cascade resulting in blood clotting has been explained in this fashion. P-192 at 22."" As you can see the common rebuttal is in fact a straw man, irreducible complexity does not state ""as we see them today"" but as they function. Attempts to defeat irreducible complexity usually consist of imagining a way that they could be arrived at but never without choosing another system to adapt. If I wanted to imagine a way to have a Boeing 747 ""life form"" appear I could do it if I had the industrial revolution to work with, but not without. I don't know why anyone hasn't pointed this out but LIFE is irreducibly complex, prior to the first cell there were no other systems to re adapt, there was no natural selection. A self reproducing cell must have formed from the random interaction of particles.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:06 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","330"
