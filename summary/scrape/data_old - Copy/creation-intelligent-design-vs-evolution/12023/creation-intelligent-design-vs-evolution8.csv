I'll admit they are not specific to that example, but you are fallaciously trying to argue that one represents the whole. The links provided discuss how mutations create new features. That is the overarching issue here. Stop using fallacies when you can't argue your primary points.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:34 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","109"

Is the pre-existing esterase the result of a frame-shift mutation? Could someone please provide the accession number and database of the PR.C sequence from Ohno (1984) [xii].? Was the classic esterase with beta-lactamase folds there from the start? Ohno (1984) suggested that the coding sequence ""originally"" specified a 472-residue-long arginine-rich protein. However this ""472-residue-long arginine-rich protein"" has no significant homology to any known functional protein. EI and EIII did not arise through a frame-shift mutation. EI has a high homology with amidases present in a lot of strains of bacteria, meaning a pre-existing enzyme was capable of breaking the amide bond of cyclic dimers . EII has a high homology with L-aminopeptidase/D-esterases present in many other bacteria. The evidence points to (and seems like the simplest explanation - Occam's razor) a pre-existing classical carboxylesterase with B-lactamase folds (NylB'/EII') with low activity (0.5% that of EII (nylB) towards nylon oligomers, gained an increase in activity towards the the oligomers through amino acid substitutions in the catalytic cleft containing the Ser-X-X-Lys motive without affecting the activity towards its original substrates. Not a frame shift mutation so it seems to me you are down to zero now...just as I said....(the ""ability to digest"" something is not a new structure....I'm looking for bodily structures such as a part of an organ or other body part -- do you not get this?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","110"
