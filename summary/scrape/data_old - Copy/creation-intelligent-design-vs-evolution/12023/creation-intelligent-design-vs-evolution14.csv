We disagree on the interpretation of the available info. And given the time, I will once again respond to your repeated claims. I must admit that the redundancy gets old fast for me.

You do understand that the whale was lying on the same angle as the strata it was found in, right? It was not a polystrate fossil-it was parallel with the strata in which it was found. It did not cross strata. Set a book on a table. Now, lift one end of the table forty degrees or so. Is the book now passing through the table? No, just like the whale is not passing through strata. And if Peeling was wrong and you do have a flood-based explanation for the rooted fossil trees in Nova Scotia, what is it?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","11:02 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","197"

No, I don't understand that at all. I understand that that was what TO, your apologist bible asserted which completely disagreed with my source. And only you could dishonestly imply that a body lying at fifty degree angle is resting in parallel position. Assuming it was at 50 degrees, couldn't an 80 to 90 foot object encompass 2, 3 or more quickly laid strata over a 40 day and night period which this flood occurred in? Are you actually suggesting that every single tree on Earth would have had to have been uprooted by the flood? Isn't it reasonable that every possible series of events would occur during such a deluge?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:34 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","198"

It's not dishonest to say the fossil is lying parallel to the strata in which it was found - you have in fact done EXACTLY what I said your creationist source expected you to do, which is intuitively visualise strata as horizontal bands and assumed that a fossil at a 50 degree angle would have to cross them. It's not about whether every single tree would have had to be uprooted. It's about the fact that flood apologetics claim all sedimantary rocks were formed by deposition over the course of 40 days. Now, the facts this model has to explain are as follows: we have discovered a location where over a dozen layers of upright, rooted tree stump fossils are stacked on top of each other, separated by further layers of deposition: The dark layers bear the fossilised hallmarks of soil, including insect burrows and so forth, and there are fossil trees in each layer, with roots and rootlets still in place. Yes, there are also unrooted chunks of fossilized wood preserved in the formation, but the significant ones as far as the flood model is concerned are these rooted examples. How can a single 40 day flood produce this formation? Also (not shown on the sketch), there is the fact that many of these stumps have root systems emerging from their trunks into the later-deposited layers, proving that they were able to continue growing for some considerable time after that section of the trunk was buried. Again, how can that happen if after 40 days they were under a kilometre of mud? I repeat: these are facts , not interpretations. It is a fact the whale fossil was not polystrate, and it is a fact that there are layer upon layer of fossilized rooted trees, many with secondary root growth from their trunks, in the Nova Scotia formation. I need make no reference to the conventional geological model to show that the flood model is incompatible with that latter fact.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","10:54 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","199"
