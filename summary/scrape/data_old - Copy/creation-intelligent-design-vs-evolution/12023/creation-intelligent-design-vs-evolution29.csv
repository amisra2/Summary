"02-16-2010","12023",29,"Databed","390769","Nope, it's not actually. Evolution simply states that things change to fit the needs of their environment. Not that they necessarily become more complex Again, beneficial change is not the same thing as a change to something more complex. Evolution does make things more fit by selecting beneficial changes. What's the problem here? Erosion contains no elements of natural selection or evolution. You are misrepresenting evolution in an attempt to pick it apart. Also, nowhere have we used the argument that its not impossible as a sole basis for our conclusions. In the case of evolution, it's not only possible, but it is obviously true. Study of abiogenesis has a ways to go, but given what we do know, it could be speculated to not only to be possible, but likely. This demonstrates a huge misunderstanding of evolution on your part. Again, systems can change function. Would you also argue that evolution states that the slow evolution of legs from fish fins was so that kangaroos could jump? Or monkeys could climb trees? I don't think you would. Climbing or jumping legs were not being selected for when fish emerged from the water and no one who truly understands evolution would think so. So give me one example of a system that has evolved without being selected for. Notice I left out the term gradual, it is not necessary when the process of evolution as a whole is already known to be gradual. I guarantee you can't do this.","Freedom","390824","Does evolution explain advancement? Does evolution explain advancement? I know, read my post. No I am not, I pointed out cases which evolution is claimed to explain but on which natural selection is not applicable. It is not a misrepresentation to say that if natural selection is not causing gradual ordered change, then it is random change; making clear my erosion example. Scaffolding is an attempt to defeat IC by pointing out that a way can be imagined for an IC system to form. On what basis does that show evolution can form an IC system? Because it is believed by many or because you need it to be true? I don't mind if you separate evolution from the toxic subject of origin, it does not defeat my position. Forgive me if I don't take your word on it. By changing the DNA that constructs the system. You do not understand irreducible complexity; adapted purpose is exactly what I accept natural selection to be capable of. No I can't. I can give you examples of systems that couldn't have been selected for before they were formed. Now I'm sure the examples used by behe are more easily verified, but I think I can name my own to illustrate the point. The emergence of eukaryotic cells. More than that is must be gradual to defeat the odds, I don't think listing my best points is helping your case.... I guarantee your attempt to show how the above mentioned novelty evolved will not include it being selected for, but will include other systems that will happen to be able to form this one.. In fact it will probably include a spontaneous occurrence as well.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:37 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","423"

If you mean organisms becoming more fit for survival, yes. If you mean a genome becoming more complex, again, yes. Behe's work on IC has been almost entirely proven false. Many of his examples of IC have been shown not even to conform to his definition of IC. In most of his examples, structures in other organisms have been shown to consist of only a portion of the in question IC structure. These simpler structures still serve a function in the other organism. The classic example of the flagella only took Ken Miller a few days to prove false. He showed that in the same organism there is a syringe structure that consists of the flagella minus 40 parts. It still functions. Other organisms contain this same syringe structure but with only 30 or so missing parts. You can see a clear progression from one structure to the supposedly IC structure. There is not a single example of a truly IC structure. As for eukaryotic cells, this is easy to explain. If you had said prokaryotic cells it would have been much more difficult. We have very little information on life before prokaryotic cells but tons of information on the life that existed before eukaryotic cells. That's because many of these examples are still around as bacteria. Most evolutionary biologists believe that eukaryotic cells evolved from a symbiotic relationship between two or more different types of prokarytic bacteria. One type found it was able to live inside the other, maybe parasitic at first. Not very difficult to imagine, right? Of course the parasite had to take care of the host to make its own survival more likely. Eventually, they evolve (independently) to be symbiotic. At this time the original parasite is able to evolve to a much simpler function, say, a single task even. The host provides energy to the parasite in return for it completing its task. This is of course leading to chloroplasts or mitochondria. I add that both carry their own separate DNA today. Why else would these organelles need their own unique copy of DNA? The nucleus is easy to explain too because the cell needed better and better ways to segregate its own DNA from the organelles. There, no dramatic leap, no lack of selection.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","424"

Your Bible tells you different so there was no such thing as Neanderthals. But Neanderthals did exist and they looked a lot like us. Here's a couple of pictures of real Neanderthal fossils.

What would you say? since no one around here knows what ToE is about we had better just trust the ones who say they do? I was rather enjoying the lack of enraged insults that I usually meet when arguing. It sounds as if you can do it for the both. I know, which is why it is not correct to assign those things to the theory. It's so nice of everyone to keep summarizing the theory for me No it isn't, were you here for my brick and leaf analogy? By imagination not evidence. Assuming that systems A B and C can form system D, natural selection cannot select for system D as it does not exist; That assumption is not evolution that is merely an assumption. I wouldn't jump to that conclusion, but it certainly isn't included in the current theory of evolution. Alright then call it magic, it's up to you. Except that ToE doesn't account for it.

Even today there are vastly different facial shapes and physiology's throughout the spectrum of humanity. Why not 10,000 years ago? The problem comes in when anthropologists find bits and pieces of simian skulls and claim that they are precursors to humans. Don't get started on the hoaxes. In fact there is plenty of conjecture still going around because science does not have to 'prove' anything. And I have seen every one of those photos above. The 'reconstructed' fossil looks a bit different in placement than the original, however, if you look at the jaw, you will see that there is practically no difference in that jaw and modern humans.

"02-17-2010","12023",29,"Freedom","390851","It's so easy when they defeat their own arguements. Thank you, you may step down. You don't know why IC is a problem then, it is not a stumbling block because there is no way it could be formed it is a stumbling block because NS doesn't effect the formation. I have repeated this same point about 10 times now, I think that's enough so I trust you will just repeat it to yourself if that is the proper rebuttal. Again (and for the last time) because a method can be conceived to form an IC system does not mean that it was probable or that evolution could have formed it. Example: I can think of a method right now to form an IC system, a single massive mutation which forms all necessary components. Behe has apparently not been informed hes been dis-proven, in fact he still seems to be doing that ""science"" thing, or at the very least he is not quoting the bible and yelling like you would have us believe all anti-evolution persons are. Excuse my ignorance I didn't know there was life before prokaryotic cells ""Found"" ""had to"" for a purpose of survival; more of those intelligence implying figures of speech I guess? Glad you brought of mitochondria,and chloroplasts both excellent examples of IC. You did not fulfill the requirements for this one but let's see you start on aerobic metabolism and solar energy usage. I don't mind if you copy paste. How did it start forming internal membranes? They don't just form from need they are assembled by multiple specific proteins. No leaps? what about parasitism? at what point before penetrating the cell membranes and using sugars or ATP is it being selected for? You say the parasite didn't kill the host? then how did it reproduce inside? There is a system that controls cell division that would need to be in place before any successful symbioses. I wonder if left for reproduction? or did the system of simultaneous reproduction appear from the void as well? You kind of swept over at the part where it switched from being a parasite to a symbiont, until that happened selection for the host would be to get rid of the thing, do we ignore that part while we let the invader continue it's evolution? About that, what task could the invader do that the host could not do before? It can't have performed mitochondrial functions outside of a cell, and if it had photo-synthesis why would it have become parasitic when it had such great advantages in energy production? Oh that reminds me, have they suggested a way for the oceans of primordial earth to be filled with abiotic sugars or ATP? If they haven't they have a serious problem with cellular metabolism before photosynthesis. More is coming into my head I don't think you would appreciate it as I am almost certain your comeback is going to be ""just because we don't know everything.""","Databed","390877","What? You think you've proven something here ? Yeah, you keep saying that but have yet to demonstrate an example of this. Problem, Genious. That's never happened! The whole argument is whether IC systems by Behe's definition actually exist. Why are you now creating hypothetical ones? Yeah, another creationist in delusion is all. He's been informed. He lost Dover vs BoE. He's been ridiculed by scientists who actually understand evolution. If you think I am constrained by the classic definition of life, you are wrong and excused. Terminology, actually. They work quite nicely. Argument from ignorance. Some of the first self-replicating molecules to exist were surely photosynthesizes. On some level they constructed higher energy molecules from solar energy. It's not a stretch to put this as a precursor to the function of chloroplasts. The same can be said with mitochondria. The original function of mitochondria was probably not the same as it is seen today. Again, functions change and I fall back on my argument from before that the organelles evolved through a symbiosis. I didn't copy and paste anything. Do I need to spell this out completely? Do you have no speculative abilities at all? Look, we see varying degrees of all of these structures in many different microbes. A common designer would suggest that all would be the same, instead we see increasing complexity in these structures that perfectly matches the time line of when the fossil record suggests they first emerged. (I know you are going to try and get me on the increasing complexity comment) Not quite. You seem to forget again that the mitochondria has surely mutated and the function of ATP production is certainly not its original function so there didn't necessarily need to be sugars to metabolize. Further, why couldn't there already be sugars produced by photosynthesizers? Who said anything about cellular metabolism before photosynthesis? I think you made that up. It would have started as a parasite and reproduced on its own, possible even free to leave the cell if it chose. At some point it would have become unable to leave its host and have been perfectly happy staying inside multiplying as the host multiplied. After being in such a system for so long, organisms become reliant on the system. This can be seen across the spectrum of evolutionary biology, zoology etc. As soon as they are reliant on each other, they begin evolving together as a benefit in one must benefit both or both die. This leads to the fine tuning of things like meiosis.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:56 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","435"
