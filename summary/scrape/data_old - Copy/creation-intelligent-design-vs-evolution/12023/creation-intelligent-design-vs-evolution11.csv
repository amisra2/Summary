"12-04-2008","12023",11,"Archangel","335354","Can you refute these scientific evidences for the flood without attacking the author or the source, but based simply on the science? Are ""polystrate"" fossils a problem for conventional geology? Well, they were not a problem to explain in the 19th century, and are still not a problem now. John William Dawson (1868) described a classic Carboniferous-age locality at Joggins, Nova Scotia, where there are upright giant lycopod trees up to a few metres tall preserved mainly in river-deposited sandstones. These trees have extensive root systems with rootlets that penetrate into the underlying sediment, which is either a coal seam (i.e. compressed plant material), or an intensely-rooted sandstone or mudstone (i.e. a soil horizon). Dawson considered and rejected anything but an in situ formation for these fossils, and his interpretation is closely similar to current interpretations of sediments deposited on river floodplains. An interesting feature of these examples is the presence of vertebrate fossils (mostly small reptiles) within the infilling of the stumps. These fossils are reasonably common, and have been mentioned in the scientific literature for well over a century, under the name upright fossils or in situ trees. No well-read geologist finds them surprising, and no geologist has ever claimed that it took millions (or even thousands) of years to bury them. Science is perfectly happy with the idea that deposition is occasionally rapid. Geologists explain their formation as being caused by episodes of rapid sedimentation within either an actively subsiding coastal plain or rift basin or by the rapid accumulation of volcanic material on the flanks and around the bases of stratovolcanoes as the result of periodic eruptions. Geologists have long accepted that a layer or set of layers containing polystrate fossils was created by a brief period of rapid sedimentation.","Larni","335384","Yes.

Second, why shouldn't it incorporate new data? Third what other way is there to explain this? Evolution isn't ""pseudo science"" how much you may want it to be, but it's just not. No it doesn't, it just happened faster, and by the way, there has been a debate going on within evolution about this stuff for quite some time now, it's called punctuated equilibrium . What is the problem with incorporating new data? Again, what is the problem with revising things as better data becomes available? Actually, this change would never take millions of years. The new evidnece shows it can happen in a short period of time too, so why would we claim it took millions of years?

"12-04-2008","12023",11,"Peeling","335366","Yep : Just to be clear, the YEC model of flood deposition depends upon the trees not being rooted in place, especially where there are well over a dozen soil horizons layered atop one another, as there are in the Nova Scotia case. Which 'flood-based' scenario do you prefer: that each layer of trees somehow managed to grow to maturity in a few hours, deep underwater, while being buried by more sediment? Or that the flood managed to scoop up and pile the layers atop one another without disturbing them in the slightest? Or you can go with the conventional explanation, which is that occasional flooding swamped each layer of trees with sediment, with time between for a new layer to grow to maturity atop the buried remains of the old. What do you say? The anomalous example in Yellowstone, where the tree fossils aren't rooted, is easily explained: violent vulcanism and landslides deposited the sediment rather than flood deposition (you can tell that because of the composition of the deposited material). However: How is that supposed to have happened in the flood model? A dinosaur's footprint, hardening beside a tree that supposedly grew to full size in a few hours under thousands of feet of sludgy water (and yes, it would have to be thousands upon thousands of feet of water for it to hold enough material to deposit the formation). Oh, and yep: Just to be perfectly clear: the whale was not a polystrate fossil. End of story. I've tackled your source head on - do you think you could find it within yourself to throw me a bone and say ""Ok, so I was wrong?""","Archangel","335392","Not at all. All you have done is posted more T.O. excuses in order to explain away solid evidence they can't refute with equally scientific facts. They actually think that claiming the whale was at a 40 to 50 degree angle rather than directly upright is evidence that the evidence is irrelevant while ignoring the evidence to the contrary. Your link ignored the fact that trees that were buried upright, without roots, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds defy the principle of gradual stratification. And you are ignoring that similar circumstances occur at various other places in Nova Scotia, as well as in the United States, England, Germany, and France. And this is only where we have discovered such evidence. One event might be coincidental or a random occurrence, but to have taken place over such a wide range supports a planetary deluge of monumental proportions. And what about the other 16 points my link refers to? Must I quote each section directly before you'll consider it? The point is that all of the scientific questions it raises and asks leads to an accurate picture of this event occurring. For example, Turbidity Currents: A turbidity current is an underwater mud flow, the discovery of which caused somewhat of a revolution in geology. As a result, many sedimentary strata layers throughout the world have been reevaluated and found to be turbidites. 34,35,36,37,38,39,40 For example, regarding turbidites and the impact they are having on modern Geology, Kurt Howard, 41 said the following in his paper on this topic: My physical geology professor said, ""Regarding uniformitarianism, you can take it with a grain of salt."" After reviewing geology texts on the subject of turbidites, I am following the courageous professor's advice. To paraphrase his words, I am taking uniformitarianism with a grain of sand, for the philosophy of uniformitarianism states that sedimentary layers form over many millions of years, while ... recent research has shown that turbidites form within a few hours. {1} Emphasis Added In 1972 Burgert identified several lower basal Tapeats units as turbidites in Grand Canyon's Cheops Bay. Dr. Ariel Roth a geologist at Loma Linda University's Geoscience Institute, suggested that 30% of all sedimentary rocks in Grand Canyon are turbidites. Some geologists suggest that 50% of the world's sedimentary rocks might be turbidites. Emphasis Added Modern geologists discarded the terms flysch sediments and geosyncline because rapidly formed megathick flysch is incompatible with uniformitarianism and long ages. However, in the last few years, the number of geologists abandoning the classical uniformitarian discipline and adopting the new catastrophism is almost a shock to ... creationists. Geologists are finally beginning to grudgingly agree with ... creationists about the nature of the stratigraphic record, which is a record of major catastrophic events and not the slow year-by-year buildup suggested by uniformitarianism. Flysch deposits might be the sedimentary results of a global flood. The idea of geosynclines is unpopular because most geologists believe in plate tectonics. Emphasis Added Extensive Strata and Pancake Layering: As we observe sedimentary strata throughout the world we see almost everywhere flat-lying (or ""pancake"") layered strata. Many of these layers are so extensive that they cover several states. Evolutionists believe that such layers were deposited slowly over millions and millions of years, or that they are simply ""river"" deposits or river deltas. 42,43 Creationists, and a growing number of geologists see problems with such interpretations. 44,45 First because there is virtually no evidence of erosion between the layers, and second, because the sheer size and extent of the strata suggests that the layers were neither formed by rivers, or river deltas. That's because many of the ""layers"" are quite thick, and cover (literally) hundreds and even thousands of square miles, and in many instances are the size of the state of Utah, or even larger. This, coupled with the presence of marine fossils that are buried in many of the layers, tells us that they were deposited by ocean currents (i.e. from a major, major Flood), like nothing we have ever seen before. We can say for certain that it was the ocean (as opposed to a lake) because of the marine fossils that are buried in much of this strata. For example, in the Grand Canyon area itself, old Earth geologists have said that the Ocean swept over the whole area on six different occasions. Young Earth geologists say it was probably only once. What is shown very clearly from all of these scientific interpretation of the same evidence is that there are two ways to interpret it. But for you evos to claim victory based on your interpretation which is as biased as ours is, is the epitome of arrogance. We may have to agree to disagree peeling, but don't you dare just assume you're right and the debate is over because you have proven nothing absolutely.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","02:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","161"
"12-04-2008","12023",11,"Archangel","335354","Can you refute these scientific evidences for the flood without attacking the author or the source, but based simply on the science? Here's just one example of the content which it argues: Let's Look at the Evidence: The following are 18 Evidences of either massive flooding and erosion, extremely rapid layering of strata, or direct evidence of a Worldwide Flood. Such evidences are found in numerous places on virtually every Continent. Polystrate Fossils: One of the strongest pieces of evidence for a worldwide flood is the existence of what Rupke termed ""polystrate fossils."" Such fossils are found all over the world. They usually consist of fossil trees that were buried upright, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds. 1,2,3,4 They range in size from small rootlets to trees over 80 feet long. 3 Sometimes they are oblique in relation to the surrounding strata, but more often they are perpendicular to it. For example, at Joggins, Nova Scotia, polystrate tree (and root) fossils are found at various intervals throughout roughly 2,500 feet of strata. Many of these are from 10-20 feet long, 5,6 and, at least one was 40 feet long. 5,6,7 Very few of these upright fossil trees have attached roots, and only about 1 in 50 8 have both roots and rootlets attached. Such trees, and their -- more often than not -- missing roots, are discussed in much more detail in The ""Fossil Forests"" of Nova Scotia. 9 Likewise, many (if not most) of the large, fragmented, and broken-off Stigmaria roots are also missing their rootlets. 9 Many of these roots and rootlets, are also buried individually. 9 This strongly suggests that these trees did not grow in the same places where they were buried, but rather were uprooted and re-deposited there. Similar circumstances occur at various other places in Nova Scotia, as well as in the United States, England, Germany, and France. Another place where large tree stumps are preserved without their roots attached is Axel Heiberg 10,11 Island in Northern Canada. And although there is much data on buried trees in the geological literature, most of it is over 100 years old, and difficult to access. One of the few articles on this subject was by Rupke, and in it he comments that: Personally, I am of the opinion that the polystrate fossils constitute a crucial phenomenon both to the actuality and the mechanism of cataclysmic deposition. Curiously a paper on polystrate fossils appears to be a 'black swan in geological literature. Antecedent to this synopsis a systematic discussion of the relevant phenomena was never published. However, geologists must have been informed about these fossils. In view of this it seems unintelligible that uniformitarianism has kept its dominant position."" 12 With regard to Rupke's observation, I suspect the reason why such is (still) the case has more to do with one's personal bias against the concept of a Creator / God to whom we might very well have to give account than to the ever-mounting evidence against the theory of evolution and the millions of years old Earth that it requires (to appear plausible). However, T-I-M-E is simply not enough: not even BILLIONS of years of it. See also The Organic Levels of the Yellowstone Petrified Forest 13 and The Yellowstone Petrified ""Forests"" 14 by Harold Coffin. Scientific Evidence for a Worldwide Flood How do you explain""polystrate fossils."" Such fossils are found all over the world. They usually consist of fossil trees that were buried upright, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds. 1,2,3,4 They range in size from small rootlets to trees over 80 feet long. 3 Sometimes they are oblique in relation to the surrounding strata, but more often they are perpendicular to it.

Another place where large tree stumps are preserved without their roots attached is Axel Heiberg 10,11 Island in Northern Canada. There are 17 other scientific facts revealed which evolutionists either avoid asking the obvious questions about, or just flat out ignore. Examples like this: A ""Whale"" of a Fossil: Or should we say ""a fossil of a whale? It's true, but what is most interesting about it is how it was buried. In 1976, workers from the Dicalite division of Grefco inc. found the remains of a baleen whale entombed vertically in a diatomaceous earth quarry. ""They've found fossils there before; in fact the machinery operators have learned a good deal about them and carefully annotate any they find with the name of the collector, the date, and the exact place found. Each discovery is turned over to Lawrence G. Barnes at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. The Whale, however, is one of the largest fossils ever collected anywhere... (It) is standing on end.. and is being exposed gradually as the diatomite is mined. Only the head and a small part of the body are visible as yet. ""The modern baleen whale is 80 to 90 feet long and has a head of similar size, indicating that the fossil may be close to 80 feet long. 46,47 So it begs the question child as to how hydrology doesn't support a young Earth or the great flood when it is only by way of a rapid sedimentary build up which buries large trees and even 80 foot long Whales upright can be explained in hydrological terms in so many diverse places which only the great flood accounts for?
