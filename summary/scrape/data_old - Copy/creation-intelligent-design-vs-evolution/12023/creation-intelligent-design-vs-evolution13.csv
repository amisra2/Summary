"12-08-2008","12023",13,"Archangel","335519","[INDENT][B][COLOR=""Blue""]Yes it does! Very few of these upright fossil trees have attached roots, and only about 1 in 50 8 have both roots and rootlets attached. Again, irrelevant issue where a whale found thousands of miles from an Ocean is concerned, and when it is standing upright in diatomite. No; it clearly say's the whale is standing vertical in diatomite. It isn't making vague implications and leaving anything to the imagination. You always imply that creationists are motivated to be dishonest as if they earn more money by promoting this belief. (the large fossils were the rooted ones) Again Peeling, you have it exactly backwards. it say's this: Very few of these upright fossil trees have attached roots, and only about 1 in 50 8 have both roots and rootlets attached. Such trees, and their -- more often than not -- missing roots, are discussed in much more detail in The ""Fossil Forests"" of Nova Scotia. 9 Likewise, many (if not most) of the large, fragmented, and broken-off Stigmaria roots are also missing their rootlets. 9 Many of these roots and rootlets, are also buried individually. 9 This strongly suggests that these trees did not grow in the same places where they were buried, but rather were uprooted and re-deposited there. I'm glad you brought this up again since you ignored my question in the last post. Prove to me how it is possible to confirm that these petrified and fossilized trees grew after being partly buried so long ago. Of course I agree with that. The problem is that it's your link that states that growth of now fossilized trees continued while they were partially buried in sediment. My question is, how do they prove that, or observe that from fossils? It's very straightforward: In the case of these polystrate trees, they were clearly alive when partially buried by sediments. Because of their size, the sediment, which accumulated around them, was insufficient to kill the trees. As a result, they developed a new set of roots from their trunks just below the new ground surface and grew higher to compensate for the part of the trunk buried by sediment. Another directly observable fact: the partly-buried trees had grown new root systems from their trunks into the newly deposited surface material - which was a distinctly seperate geological layer from that in which their original root systems had formed. I never said geologists said it took millions of years to bury these trees peeling. we both know that if it took the millions of years for strata to form through sedimentary deposits , even an upright tree would never be found in more than one layer as it would have long since rotted away through exposure above the sediment line. You're ignoring these contradictions which directly conflict with the process of stratification But my point is that if the flood occurred in reality, then potentially 2 or 3,000 feet of diverse and unique instant stratification layers with instantly buried organic and biological life, was formed in 40 short days as each new strata settled upon the one below it giving the appearance to belief hungry evolutionists that this ring of evidence represents hundreds of millions of years of evolution. This explains the randomness of the types of life found in places they normally wouldn't be, and with creatures they wouldn't be caught dead with, if they had a choice that is. I marvel at how evolutionists can be digging up sea creatures, both freshwater and Ocean types, side by side with both large and small mammals, reptiles and amphibians and never beg the question as to how this occurred. And yet, these same alleged scientists know full well that if anyone lays any type of dead body out in the wild, and comes back in only 7 days, it will be consumed, ravaged and its bones will be spread far and wide by the predators which ate what they wanted and then dropped what remained where they were.","Peeling","335852","Ah, my mistake. So it does admit that there are layers of fossil trees with roots and rootlets attached. Which is a bit like a defense attourney saying ""Yes, but only about 1/50th of the DNA taken from the scene belonged to my client"" Over a dozen layers of fossil trees, rooted in different layers of soil, cannot have been laid down by a single, short-lived flood . Do you agree? I beg your pardon? The fact that the fossil isn't polystrate isn't relevant to the creationist suggestion that it is ? Fact: The whale was lying parallel to the sedimentary layer in which it was found. It was not polystrate. So why would your creationist source bring it up in a discussion of polystrate fossils if not to mislead you into thinking it was polystrate? Oh really? So it makes it explicitly clear that the diatomite layer in which the whale was preserved is also folded at the same 40-50 degree angle, does it? No, it doesn't. It lets you assume that the whale is standing vertically in a bed of horizontal strata - be honest, that's what you pictured, isn't it? So their deception worked. I don't recall ever bringing money into it at all, actually. I don't think it's necessary to posit financial gain as a motive for creationists. I know it says that. Now, if you would be so kind, point out to me where that says the large fossil trees weren't the rooted ones? It doesn't, does it? It just talks about how there are lots of fossil trees, and some of them are really big, and how very few of them have attached roots and rootlets. You've interpreted that to mean very few of the really big ones had attached roots and rootlets, whereas what it actually says is that very few of the fossils in total had them. Eh??? I didn't ignore your question; that was my answer to your question! Look: How many more different ways do you want me to answer? We can tell the trees carried on growing because they have new root systems growing out from their trunks into multiple successive geological layers. That could not have happened if the whole tree was buried in one go. Do you agree? Um, yes you did See? If the flood occurred in reality in 40 short days, then how did a dozen layers of trees get a chance to grow to maturity, rooted in a dozen clearly distinct different soil layers, putting out more roots from their trunks into the sedimentary layers deposited atop those soil layers, all the way down that kilometre of sediment? And where is this 'side by side' discovery supposed to have happened? Yes, and? That's why relatively complete fossils are incredibly, incredibly rare: it requires exceptional circumstances. Most of the time all we do find is a skull or a thigh bone or a pelvis or a tooth.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:33 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","194"
