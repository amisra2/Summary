So I may as well argue that if you move X distance in a radius of living organism and the vast majority of the random vectors end in non-living matter the organisms are far apart, and I would. I am sorry that you cannot see the pattern, the cherry is the most generic description of function a structure can have. A structure can have more than one of those but it is quite impossible to have variants fail to meet it's most basic defining functions so it happens that no actual co-opting exists between them since the function already exists for all. Why is the need to carry humans to where they are going so fundamentally different from the kind of selection pressures real systems would experience? So for reasons which must be admitted are totally irrelevant to flight, which can never be demonstrated to have any relationship except coincidental similarity the car gains all the necessary elements for flight and thereby a novel system is evolved. What about this, one car's offspring is an ultra light. Impossible or just unlikely, and heres the biggie, is that evolution? That does not mean every system is merely variant shapes of each other, as you would have to admit if you looked at some. Sure I can, and I will tell you why. The category of thing is not arbitrary nor are their functions imagined. It will never be selected on a function that it is not performing, that is not arbitrary it is simple extension of the law of cause and effect projected onto the concept of natural selection. Sure, but since the object is a screwdriver that means a sharper edge is making it a better screwdriver. If it is now cutting it has changed or added a function has it not, and is it not now being selected based on it's function as a knife? It is then being selected by the standard of it's function as a hammer which makes it a hammer. What purpose do these intermediate systems [of the flagellum] serve in the explaination? No guided path can bridge a change in function, You misunderstand, co-option is purely through chance until someone of us comes up for a theory why it should be any particular way or in any pattern. By the nature of DNA mathematically the calculation of the odds for co-option and the odds for a mutation performing the same function are equivalent. Without that fact I could hardly keep arguing.","Peeling","425302","Why on earth would you think I'm forgetting that? No, you're still missing the point. You've said that since the majority of DNA sequences are non-functional, functional DNA sequences must be assumed to be widely separated. But we know this not to be the case. Functional DNA sequences cluster. If that were not the case, no fitness gradients of any kind could exist. Therefore we know gene-space exhibits pattern and continuity. How can you justify your assumption that this continuity is, or should be expected to be, compartmentalised in a way that suits your argument? Then I cherry pick ""aids survival and reproduction"" as the most generic possible description of any biological structure or system's function, and thus remove any obstacle to co-option. Too simplistic. Imagine functions A, B and C, and a structure that strongly satisfies the requirements of A and weakly those of B. If satisfying B becomes strongly selected for, the structure can, through improvements to its B function, acquire slight C functionality, which can then in turn be selected for. My earlier example illustrates this: a hammer is no use whatsoever as a screwdriver, but can eventually evolve into one via intermediate steps. It isn't; that's the point. Cars can't gradually evolve into planes - not because acquiring a new function by gradual steps is impossible, as you insist, but because the gradual steps by which it would be possible are being strongly selected against by the aforementioned need to carry humans. No; that's a distortion of what I wrote. I said that the car could evolve to be smaller and lighter. Mass decreasing by the cube, area by the square; it's why mice can survive a fall that would kill us outright, and it's why mice (or something similar) could evolve flight and elephants could not. What's impossible or unlikely about a mammal evolving to be smaller and lighter, and thus becoming susceptible to selection for improved falling, gliding and eventually flying performance? Not direct variants, certainly. But I can't help remembering my Theory of Computability, and how no computer, physical or electrical, possesses any more utility than a Turing machine, though it may certainly possess less. I suspect the same argument could extend to physical function. All a biological system has to do to be selected is 'aid survival and reproduction'. We can have a stab at understanding how it aids survival and reproduction but we will almost certainly miss some nuance, and our categorisation will therefore be in error. Hence, arbitrary. I've never tried to argue otherwise. You're so close, but no. In being selected as a screwdriver it inevitably acquires a minor secondary ability to cut - and hammer, and all kinds of other misuses. If these minor abilities prove beneficial, modifications favouring them will be selected - providing the benefit outweighs any coincident loss of 'screwdriver-ness'. I think it would be very hard indeed to argue that improvement in function ever - let alone usually - leads to the elimination of all potential secondary or tertiary uses. And since that is critical to your hypothesis, you don't seem to have much of a leg to stand on. Or kick a football with. Or press an accelerator pedal. Or trip up a moose. This determination to rigidly compartmentalise is... unhelpful. A tool or system can be tugged in many directions, not all of them contradictory. A bat's forearms are primarily wings, but it can also use them to climb. A flying fox's limbs are primarily for climbing, and its skin primarily for keeping its insides in a comfortable configuration, yet these primary functions brought the whole close enough to 'gliding' for selection to favour further modifications in that direction. They counter your assertion that nature could not rely upon the existence of such alternative-function intermediates to give rise to the flagellum. The absurd odds calculated for its spontaneous formation reduce to the chances of organisms possessing one intermediate system encountering an environment in which the next was beneficial. There you go again, trying to cut the world up into distinct functions. Obviously you accept that functionality is analogue, else evolution of any kind would be impossible, yes? So what on earth makes you think that systems, as a matter of course, can possess an analogue amount of only one 'kind' of functionality? Can you even give a single concrete example of that being the case? Given that your hypothesis depends upon it almost always being the case, for every system, it would seem appropriate to provide some. We don't know why gravity behaves as it does. Is that 'chance' too? Then you really ought to stop You have no odds representing the chances of co-option. Whether or not our arbitrarily chosen 'fitness-to-a-function-we-think-we-understand-but-probably-don't' gradients form a mesh is an intrinsic property of gene-space, like the very existence of fitness gradients themselves. Can you calculate the odds of the existence of fitness gradients? Not meaningfully: as I keep pointing out the near-infinite majority of mappings do not preserve homologies; the odds of genes consistently exhibiting fitness gradients by chance approaches zero. Since we see them, clearly they don't exist by chance; clearly there is something lawful at work.

You seem to have misunderstood my comment about DNA for what of your baseless assertions about sequences I could only assume exist. I am saying that since the majority of mutations are neutral and negative we know that the systems of life are isolated in the gene space. There are no if ands or buts about it, if they were truly clustered as you hope they are mutations would oft as not fall upon another function or system. You are asking us to believe that this is inded the case but we simply can't observe it. You are asking us to believe in the most unlikley patterns that could exist, singular strings connecting different functions which are too small to be noticed in all the mutations we have ever observed but real enough for co-option to explain advancement, not only this but these strings connect every known function since it is your replacement for evolutionary theory. Simply making generalizations about observations is all I have done, it is that wishful thinking above which requires support. Lol, nice try but again biology is against you. Many things can aid survival and reproduction. They all do it in various ways though, it is that very reason why selection pressure is always based on the system in quesiton and how it is benefiting the organism. The how is the function not the do. To illustrate the absurdity of your claim, does a flagellum have co-option with extra cellular nerve ending complexes? They both aid in survival and reproduction. It of course would be the same sort of magic to say that a flagellum modification generates nerve endings in a non-random manner as the rest but since you walked right into most obvious and extreame case of the fallacy I will let you see what you can do. Why would improving B form C functionality? It is the inability to answer that question with anything more than 'just because' that neccesitates my conclusion that this is no more an explaination for life than a 'just because' in the case of mutation. Impossible as a result of a process, not impossible as an unpredictable chance. Answer the question please. Obviously, and just as obviously it needs to in some way do this. That is the function. We know many functions, that aside our inability to categorize them all means absolutely nothing to the fact that they must exist to aid in survival and reproduction by definition. Why in the world would you think the idea that everything or anything has only one use is a premise to any of my arguments? It is helpful to a proper analysis, I am glad to see you thinking of it correctly, i.e. as directions which mutations move a system. Do they? Let's take a chess board, there is one particular set of peice locations that happens to be desired. From the starting positions it takes 114 moves to reach this position. A young chess player comes and insists he can do it in 4. They ask him how, he answers that he will start with a board that only requires four moves. Then they break the news to him, they aren't going to tell him what the desired peice-locations are, but there are some other peice locations that are helpful although they will not tell him if any of these have a relationship with the desired arangement. What use are the helpful sets then he asks? Oh well normally you would have to start from the standard setup, but once you find a helpful set you may start from there in a new round. Do you think his odds of finding the desired set are any higher? Think about this before you answer, do you know where the helpful sets are compared to the desired one? For all you know they could be farther away than the starting positions. The point, MY POINT is that you just don't know and so you can't claim to explain the discovery of the desired set as anything but dumb luck, no matter how many helpful sets you set up. Yes the genetic differential between an intermediate and a proposed novel function could be less, that is a chance which as of right now you can't predict just like it is a chance that a mutation would render that advantage pointless. The source material for either calculation is the same. Just biology for now I don't rely on any system only having one function, but I do rely on the fact that any system which has the function may be ruled out from the list of canidates to be used in any explaination of the formation of the function. I was merely pointing out that trying to posit examples in which co-option is meant to be supported by having a system not change functions but emphazie one or the other, or otherwise modify a function that already exists is self-defeating. Of course not, but no one is claiming to explain where gravity comes from, and if they tried to do so with an appeal to odds then that I would 'cry chance'. I see, so in the absence of a theory we are too assume these things are not by chance as would be any sane persons first impulse but by unknown laws which escape us but may still be relied upon. Sounds like another sect who claims to have a scientific explaination for life I know of.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","01:17 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","724"
"03-05-2011","12023",49,"Freedom","425257","Don't get too excited, you have thought you found a flaw in my reasoning before only to quit again after a few posts. My post has nothing to do with ID. I maintain that a function could not have developed from a previous function if the keyword developed is meant to mean formed non-randomly as a result of selection pressures. What is claimed to be going on is the spontaneous, unexplained, totally random drunkard walk accident that a sequence is stumbled upon that is capable of performing a novel function. Developed is not the word for this, popped into existance or spontaneous generation is. It has nothing to do with selection or explaination, if I were to write a book about it the first page would read ""Variation exists, all functionality comes from the chance that a variation might function"". Now don't say something idiotic like ""yea that is what evolution is"", if that is what evolution is then why is it that whenever any of the 'traditional' IC advocates start talking about the odds immediately as if it should matter natural selection is thrown into their face. 1. There are those who think the type III secretory system evolved from a flagellum, any comments on that? 2. You see it easily? could you give some measurements in genetic differential to back up that gut insticnt? You misunderstand the problem if you think IC prevents development because the 'old' function might be still useful. The IC analysis which I have refined to my guided genetic change test makes it very clear that it doesn't matter a XXXX what the sequence was before. It could be a vestigial useless piece of junk DNA or the crux of the organism, the only difference is the possibility that function can be increased due to similarity with final is if the current is performing the same function. Now what you say is true, if selective pressures are strong keeping a sequence a certain way that would stop it's evolution but that is another layer and certainly not why novelty is a problem. If you insist on invoking co-option for an existing useful function you will have to throw in the random generation of differentiation systems (to build a flagellum one place and a secretory system in another), but compared to the actual fairy dust of the advancement itself that is small change. How optimistic! A novel function was generated by token of it already existing... yea I get it now...","Bennedict","425329","1. no, the type 3 secretory system did not evolve from the flagellum, nor did the flagellum evolve from the type 3. they are both modern systems, and their similarities in structure suggest a common ancestor. my examples were purely hypothetical. 2. no, i cannot substantiate that. it is an opinion of mine. so, like i said earlier, many systems can potentially conduct universal functions, such as the mouse trap example developing the function to swim. i understand that changing from catching mice to squashing grapes is not a change in function, so thats a bad example - maybe a half-co-option, if one exists? - but a mouse trap can do many other things as well. it may be used as an oar if the environment demands it to. so this is a complete change in function (from snapping to water propulsion) without a mutation of any kind.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:45 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","725"
