This is a falsifiable date.The Bible gives the date of the flood as beginning 2345 BCE and ending in 2344 BCE If this were really the world-wide gig claimed by creationists then the civilizations of the world would all show a disruption in their history or at least take note of such an event, but does the rest of archeology/history corroborate the Biblical account===> NO! 1. The city of Ur of the Chaldees (ancient Sumer, location of the ""plains of Shinar"", hangout of Noah) was the leading city from about 2400 BCE until about 2,285 BCE and its history is not broken by any flood in this period. 2. Babylon was rising to power from about 2,400 BCE on and reached a great height of civilization under the famous King Hammurabi, who would have been a contempory of Hebrew patriarch Abraham (about 2,250 BCE), and again there is no break in this history due to a flood. 3. In Egypt, the 5th Dynasty, which began to reign about 2,465 BCE, was followed by the 6th Dynasty (2,323 BCE), which ruled to about 2000 BCE. This time-period is very well-documented and there was no disruption during the 5th Dynasty at the time of Noah's flood, 2,345 BCE, with the nation remaining strong and powerful throughout these dynasties. 4. The Harappan Civilization(2300 - 1900 BCE) in India shows no disruptions at the time of the Flood and, ironically, appears to have ended because of a region-wide drought! (some used to think that an invasion was the cause, but the evidence points away from this earlier scenario). 5. Chinese history begins nearly 3,000 BCE. The Shu-King historic record of China, shows that King Yao came to the throne in 2356 BCE and ruled China for many years after the alleged flood. Incidentally, durring the reign of Yao, the Shu King reports that the Hwang Ho River flooded on a number of times, for three generations, again with NO break in history. Please consult the History of China or THIS timeline. The only place you find these early rulers listed are at Chinese sites (spelled Tangyao, Westerners shorten this to Yao). 6. Ancient civilizations in India which predate the Bible entirely and shows no evidence that such an event ever happened ( appearance of the oldest book of the Hindu religion, the Rig Veda pre-dates the Bible considerably, according to astronomical dating provided by astronomical events listed in the Rig Veda)"" Did Noah's Flood Happen? :: Deus Diapente","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","03:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","166"

"12-05-2008","12023",12,"Archangel","335392","Not at all. All you have done is posted more T.O. excuses in order to explain away solid evidence they can't refute with equally scientific facts. They actually think that claiming the whale was at a 40 to 50 degree angle rather than directly upright is evidence that the evidence is irrelevant while ignoring the evidence to the contrary. Your link ignored the fact that trees that were buried upright, without roots, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds defy the principle of gradual stratification. Geologists have also found that some of the larger polystrate trees found within Carboniferous coal-bearing strata show evidence of regeneration after being partially buried by sediments. In the case of these polystrate trees, they were clearly alive when partially buried by sediments. Because of their size, the sediment, which accumulated around them, was insufficient to kill the trees. As a result, they developed a new set of roots from their trunks just below the new ground surface and grew higher to compensate for the part of the trunk buried by sediment.[4] Until they either died or were overwhelmed by the accumulating sediments, these polystrate would likely continue to regenerate by adding height and new roots with each increment of sediment, eventually leaving several of meters of former ""trunk"" buried underground as sediments accumulated. And you are ignoring that similar circumstances occur at various other places in Nova Scotia, as well as in the United States, England, Germany, and France. Contrary to the claims of creationists, these sedimentary basins are considerably smaller than the state of Texas. The specific layers, which contain polystrate fossils, occupy only a very, very limited fraction of the total area of any of these basins. And what about the other 16 points my link refers to? Must I quote each section directly before you'll consider it?","Peeling","335450","AA, please, read what was posted. The significant fact is not the angle of the whale, but the fact that it was parallel to the sedimentary layer in which it was buried . By definition it was not a polystrate fossil. Polystrate = many strata . This fossil = single strata. So, how about that 'I was wrong' now? And you're continuing to ignore the fact that geologists know not all stratification is gradual By the way, the claim that these trees 'traverse' coal beds is highly misleading. The ones that 'traverse' coal beds are those with roots, and only 'traverse' the bed because they are rooted in it! Let's be perfectly clear about this: the unrooted examples present no problem at all to conventional geology, while the rooted examples are fatal to the flood model. Particularly examples like this : How is that supposed to happen? If the whole tree was buried in one go under thousands of feet of sediment, how is it supposed to carry on growing? I'm not ignoring it. The vast majority of fossil forests are rooted , and they invariably found in locations known to be susceptible to rapid deposition: floodplains, areas of excessive vulcanism and so forth. And once again, your source is clearly and deliberately misleading you: Do you understand what they're doing? This is equivalent to saying that there is a Wal-Mart covering an area the size of the United States. I'm happy to go through them all, if you like, but I think it better to clear the first couple up before moving on, otherwise we're just going to get lost and confused. I'm not boring you, am I? To recap: The Whale Purely and simply, this was not a polystrate fossil, by definition. It lay parallel to the sedimentary layer in which it was found - a layer which was itself folded and distorted by geological movement, hence the 40-50 degree angle. The trees. Conventional geology satisfactorily explains all the phenomena we've discussed, and has done for a hundred years. Rapid deposition is an established feature of geology and can be traced to proximate causes: periodic flooding, vulcanism, landslips etc. Fatal problems for the flood model: These are observed facts , not interpretations, for which the flood model simply cannot account. 1. Stacked layers which include rooted trees. While it's perhaps conceivable that the flood model could accommodate a rooted tree in the lowest soil layer of a formation, it's not conceivable that a flood could deposit and stack atop one another a dozen or more continuous soil layers, each containing rooted trees, and separated by layers of limestone or other materials. Conventional explanation: Trees grew, were partially and eventually completely covered by layers of rapid and/or gradual sedimentation, and then more trees grew on top. This process repeated over a substantial period of time to produce the observed effect. 2. Fossilised footprints, deep underground, beside rooted tree fossils. What on earth is the story here? How can a dinosaur leave a footprint halfway down a thousand-yard column of precipitating sediment? Conventional explanation: As above. Because the layers were not all depositied in one giant lump, there was ample time for the dinosaur to walk across the surface and leave footprints, which were subsequently covered by later stratification. 3. Trees continuing to grow after being partially buried. What more needs to be said? How can a tree, buried a kilometre or more beneath a billion tons of mud over the space of a few weeks, put out decades of extra growth? Conventional explanation: As above. Large trees survived periodic inundations with sediment and thrust out new roots into the new ground layers, continuing to grow. Further reading: One of the original papers on the subject. As I said, I'm happy to go through the rest of the page with you if you like, but what I'd like to hear first is either a flood-based explanation for the phenomena above, or an honest admission that you can neither conceive of one nor find one on the internet. I don't think that's asking too much, do you?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:47 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","172"

"12-05-2008","12023",12,"Peeling","335459","Sorry, I missed this little aside earlier: I don't think the posts I've made thus far imply any such assumption - I apologise if I've given that impression. All I've done is presented facts, direct observations, for which the flood model is unable to account, and explained why conventional geology can account for those same observations. I'm not assuming the conventional explanation is certainly correct, I'm just pointing out that it does fit the facts. Why do you feel 'agreeing to disagree' is the only option? Whatever happened to plain old 'agreeing'? We can do it a tiny step at a time, if you like. Do you agree that a fossil lying parallel to the sedimentary layer in which it is found is not a polystrate fossil? See, that wasn't so bad. about : do you agree that a tree cannot continue to grow for several decades after being buried under a kilometre of mud? Do you agree that a flood could not deposit a dozen or more stacked layers of trees, still rooted in the soil in which they grew, seperated by yards of limestone and other minerals? We really don't need to agree to disagree on these points; it's perfectly OK to just agree. If you're worried how I or others might react if you did, please don't. Anyone who scorns another for being reasonable is, frankly, an XXX, and their opinion may be safely disregarded.","Archangel","335465","I have no problem agreeing with that as a factual statement. But that isn't what the evidence states according to my source. It's only your pro-evolution source which states that and I have no reason to believe your version over my own. Of course I agree with that. The problem is that it's your link that states that growth of now fossilized trees continued while they were partially buried in sediment. My question is, how do they prove that, or observe that from fossils? Again Peeling, you are picking and choosing the evidence you will accept. It was shown that both rooted and un-rooted trees were standing vertical through multiple layers of strata when we both know that if it took the millions of years for strata to form through sedimentary deposits, even an upright tree would never be found in more than one layer as it would have long since rotted away through exposure above the sediment line. You're ignoring these contradictions which directly conflict with the process of stratification, and if these examples are correct, (which I believe they are undeniable observations) then the dating methods evos come to based on dating strata are seriously flawed. As it's perfectly ok for you to just agree regarding the innumerable inconsistencies and unprovable assumptions made by evolutionists. I don't know why you always expect me to convert you your way of thinking rather than you seriously considering the inconsistencies your pseudo science promotes.

You're ignoring these contradictions which directly conflict with the process of stratification, In a few years after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, the erosion of loose pyroclastic deposits covering its slopes created a series of volcanic lahars, which ultimately buried large parts of the countryside along major streams draining these slopes beneath several meters of volcanic sediments. The repeated deposition of sediments by volcanic lahars and sediment filled rivers not only created innumerable polystrate trees, but also polystrate telephone poles, churches, and houses, over a period a few years.[8] The volcanic deposits enclosing these modern polystrate trees are often virtually identical in their sedimentary structures, external and internal layering, texture, buried soils, and other general character to the volcanic deposits containing the Yellowstone buried forests. As in case of modern forests buried by lahars, the individual buried forests of the Yellowstone Petrified Forest and the layers containing them are very limited in their areal extent As it's perfectly ok for you to just agree regarding the innumerable inconsistencies and unprovable assumptions made by evolutionists.

It merely fails to mention data fatal to the flood model. Does it say anything at all about the layer upon layer of rooted tree fossils? No. Does it say anything about the evidence of post-deposition tree growth? No. Does it say anything about the whale actually crossing several strata? No - it just says the fossil was 'vertical', and lets you assume from that statement that it crossed horizontal strata. Go back and read it again - I'm right, aren't I? Now look at what it says about the proportion of rooted and unrooted fossils - 1 in 50 rooted, yes? And it says that some were up to 10, 20, even 40 feet long, yes? What it doesn't tell you is that it was the long ones that were rooted. Factually speaking, then, your source doesn't significantly contradict mine - it's merely less complete. So we are still not obliged to agree to disagree. You can take on board the extra facts and see if your source's conclusions still make sense. It's very straightforward: Another directly observable fact: the partly-buried trees had grown new root systems from their trunks into the newly deposited surface material - which was a distinctly seperate geological layer from that in which their original root systems had formed. I'm really, really not ignoring anything As I said before, there are several well-known geological processes that result in rapid stratification - heck, one of them is flooding! Please stop saying geologists think it took millions of years to bury these trees; it isn't true: Nor am I picking and choosing the evidence I'll accept. As I stated clearly earlier, both the rooted and unrooted trees fit perfectly well within the conventional geological models. It is your creationist source which is cherry-picking the unrooted examples while ignoring the rooted examples that are fatal to their model. But that's just it: here we are talking about facts. Facts that fit one theory and not another. It's a fact that trees can't grow under a kilometre of mud. It's a fact these rooted fossil trees did carry on growing, long after the deposition of the first layer of sedimentation. It's a fact that there are in some places over a dozen such fossil layers stacked atop one another with thick intervening layers of other minerals. These facts do not fit a theory involving a single, short-lived flood. They just don't. Forget the conventional geological model. Pretend it doesn't exist. Does that help you explain these observations in terms of a flood? No! It's still completely impossible for a flood lasting a few weeks to have created these formations. I understand you're not trying to get me to accept Jesus here. I'm not trying to get you to abandon Jesus, or even accept the conventional geological model for that matter. What I'm trying to get you to do is assess the flood model in light of the facts. Does it make the least bit of sense?

Please stop saying geologists think it took millions of years to bury these trees; it isn't true:","Archangel","335519","Yes it does! ""polystrate fossils."" Such fossils are found all over the world. They usually consist of fossil trees that were buried upright, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds. 1,2,3,4 They range in size from small rootlets to trees over 80 feet long. 3 Sometimes they are oblique in relation to the surrounding strata, but more often they are perpendicular to it. For example, at Joggins, Nova Scotia, polystrate tree (and root) fossils are found at various intervals throughout roughly 2,500 feet of strata. Many of these are from 10-20 feet long, 5,6 and, at least one was 40 feet long. 5,6,7 Very few of these upright fossil trees have attached roots, and only about 1 in 50 8 have both roots and rootlets attached. Such trees, and their -- more often than not -- missing roots, are discussed in much more detail in The ""Fossil Forests"" of Nova Scotia. 9 Likewise, many (if not most) of the large, fragmented, and broken-off Stigmaria roots are also missing their rootlets. 9 Many of these roots and rootlets, are also buried individually. 9 This strongly suggests that these trees did not grow in the same places where they were buried, but rather were uprooted and re-deposited there. Again, irrelevant issue where a whale found thousands of miles from an Ocean is concerned, and when it is standing upright in diatomite. And here's more: Chapter 19 Appendix Part 2 Living and fossil marine life has been found far inland in continental areas. The book, Anomalies in Geology: Physical, Chemical, Biological, by *W.R. Corliss (1989), lists a number of these on pages 48-52. Here are some sample items: (1) Freshwater seals in Lake Baikal, indicates that that lake was once connected with the ocean. (2) Mummified seals in Antarctica. (3) Whale skeletons in Vermont; Ontario, Canada; Sweden (330 feet [101 m) high, 20 miles [32 km] inland); Norway; Michigan; Alabama. (4) Marine invertebrates living in fresh water in Lake Tanganyika, Lake Baikal, New York lake, Ross Ice Shelf, Lake Titicaca. (5) Salmon in northern U.S. lakes. (s) Sharks and Sawfish in a Nicaraguan lake (110 miles [177 km] from the ocean). (7) Herring and salmon in Lake Baikal. (8) Seahorses in Lake Titicaca. (8) Sponges and dead fish on Ross Ice Shelf. For details, see the book. [The existence of living seahorses in Lake Titicaca is questioned by some experts.] No; it clearly say's the whale is standing vertical in diatomite. It isn't making vague implications and leaving anything to the imagination. You always imply that creationists are motivated to be dishonest as if they earn more money by promoting this belief. When in fact, it's evolutionists who attempt to stifle any opposing evidence by force and intimidation if need be. They will destroy the credibility and professional character of any expert who dares go public with contradictory evidence. Again Peeling, you have it exactly backwards. it say's this: Very few of these upright fossil trees have attached roots, and only about 1 in 50 8 have both roots and rootlets attached. Such trees, and their -- more often than not -- missing roots, are discussed in much more detail in The ""Fossil Forests"" of Nova Scotia. 9 Likewise, many (if not most) of the large, fragmented, and broken-off Stigmaria roots are also missing their rootlets. 9 Many of these roots and rootlets, are also buried individually. 9 This strongly suggests that these trees did not grow in the same places where they were buried, but rather were uprooted and re-deposited there. Sure it does, and it is as complete as yours, but unlike what evolutionists do, my source isn't adding nonexistent details in order to attempt to strengthen their position. And evos do that so they don't have to face the realities of the inconsistencies of evolution. I'm glad you brought this up again since you ignored my question in the last post. Prove to me how it is possible to confirm that these petrified and fossilized trees grew after being partly buried so long ago. I never said geologists said it took millions of years to bury these trees peeling. I said evolutionists claim it takes millions of years for strata to build upon strata and that they are reliable ways of determining which epoch, or geological time period they are in at the time. But my point is that if the flood occurred in reality, then potentially 2 or 3,000 feet of diverse and unique instant stratification layers with instantly buried organic and biological life, was formed in 40 short days as each new strata settled upon the one below it giving the appearance to belief hungry evolutionists that this ring of evidence represents hundreds of millions of years of evolution. And thus, a new secular religion is born. Too bad it's just another false cult though. This explains the randomness of the types of life found in places they normally wouldn't be, and with creatures they wouldn't be caught dead with, if they had a choice that is. I marvel at how evolutionists can be digging up sea creatures, both freshwater and Ocean types, side by side with both large and small mammals, reptiles and amphibians and never beg the question as to how this occurred. To any rational person it would appear to be a mass extinction. But evos interpret it as they all died at their leisure over hundreds of millions of years. And yet, these same alleged scientists know full well that if anyone lays any type of dead body out in the wild, and comes back in only 7 days, it will be consumed, ravaged and its bones will be spread far and wide by the predators which ate what they wanted and then dropped what remained where they were. So it goes without saying that something big happened at once and it indiscriminately buried massive amounts of biological and organic life instantly or else they would have just ended up like any other carcass which dies out in the open and we would have even less fossil evidence than is currently available to fossil hunters.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:24 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","179"

Any evolutionists want to explain how the theory isn't complete sci fi? Evolution of a new body part, even a new function will do If you can list it in steps and show direct observation of those steps, that'd be fine too","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","11:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","180"
