Some use gene flow as a basis, but since they are extinct, this doesn't really work. I don't know if the first is true or not. But I can say, looking for key differences in the fossil record and comparing the amount of genetic drift that necessarily happened based on isolation and time is usually a good place to start. When you see consistent differences between two groups and at the same time consistent similarities within groups, you normally conclude you have two species. These differences need to be pronounced and easily apparent.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","10:38 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","438"

"02-17-2010","12023",30,"Databed","390817","That is mitochondrial DNA and yes they were rules out. This was already known based on the fossil record. They were human by the very definition of human. Just like tigers are cats and monkeys are primates. You really don't think there is evidence of other species of humans? Come on, you don't think you are delusional? What more do you need? Look at this - This is not us, you already made that clear. What do you think it is then?","Easyrider","390943","Another species. After all, there's no conclusive DNA evidence Neanderthals are direct-line ancestors of modern man, correct?

There is no doubt in my mind that we evolved from some of the hominids that have been uncovered and this is based solely on information other than DNA evidence. At one time, evolutionary study was only concerned with morphological data. Most of what we know about modern phylogeny was based on this data. When DNA came along we confirmed most our conclusions, however, some were shown to be wrong and other conclusions replaced them. There is no arguing with the DNA especially when you take junk DNA like ERV's into account. No creationist has yet come with an explanation for ERV mapping. Saying morphological studies can't be proof in this case is pretty much the same thing as saying DNA comparisons can't be proof. I have no doubt that if we had the DNA to show you that we are descended from extinct species of hominid, you would either ignore it or try to come up with some ""God just created us that way"" or a common design from a common designer argument. That's the beauty of ERV mapping. We know precisely how the mechanism forms and can reproduce it. It can be shown to be a random occurrence with a known cause. Therefore, either God controls every whim of our existence or these occurrences are not created at all. There is a thread I started a while back on ERV mapping if you need more info on it.

Other conclusions, or inferences? Seems to me like we see a heck of a lot of inferences coming out of evolutionists (i.e. the data ""suggests"", etc.). Can you show us conclusively that God cannot possibly be involved in gradualism? I have no doubt that if God appeared to you and confirmed he created the species that you would crucify him. And the reason would be two-fold: (1) Evolutionists would be out of a job and disgraced, and (2) God comes with a moral framework and you folks probably don't want to humble yourselves and be convicted of sin.

"02-18-2010","12023",30,"None","None","None","electrolyte","390989","I'm a bit hesitant to weigh in here. Not because Freedom has anything even resembling a good argument, but because he doesn't and doesn't realize it. Freedom, if I am not mistaken, you have claimed that IC presents a problem for evolution because producing an IC system requires selection for a system that doesn't yet exist. Let's take a look at what IC is. You've posted Behe's original definition from his book. Did you know that he later ""updated"" his definition to include reference ""core"" components? Did you know that Dembski later took it upon himself to re-redefine IC? Did you notice that Dembski's re-redefinition actually gutted the entire concept? The original intent of introducing IC as a hurdle for evolution is essentially what you have claimed: that natural selection could not produce a structure that could not function without each component in place; that removing even one piece destroyed the functionality of that system. This is an entirely conceptual idea: unguided, stepwise evolution cannot produce such a system. The problem is that unguided, stepwise evolution can produce such a system. Once the underlying concept -- that unguided, stepwise evolution cannot produce such a system -- has been refuted, the claim falls apart. It's not even a question of finding such a system (although it has been done plenty). Busting the idea busts the ""problem."" Conceiving of any way that unguided evolution can produce an ""IC"" system disproves the entire point. Scaffolding can do this. Scaffolding HAS does this. Consider the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. This protein has three domains, two of which are homologous; one of these domains is a duplication of another, and one of those two domains has experienced enough mutation to have a slightly different function than the original. The pre-duplication protein had two functions; the post-duplication and post-mutation protein had three functions, yet it's all one piece. A second, different protein that formerly performed the ""newest"" (third) function could be lost without imparting a selection pressure upon the possessing species. But the IC approach declares that the system is now irreducibly complex. Removing one component of the system -- the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase -- removes functionality of that biochemical pathway. The protein that formerly performed the same function as the new (third) domain of CPS made the evolution of the current form of CPS possible without losing functionality of the system , but a current snapshot of the system would make the IC-believer conclude that the system could not have evolved. Even if this situation were entirely hypothetical, it refutes the ability of the concept of IC to be effective in showing the impossibility of an evolutionary pathway. And it's not even hypothetical. You have claimed that IC produces a problem because there can be no natural selection for a system that does not exist. There can be no natural selection FOR a system that does not exist, but there can be natural selection OF a system that does not exist in that there can be selection FOR parts that can end up forming that system. This is the case for the allegedly IC bacterial flagellum. Components that were useful to the organism were combined in previously nonexistent ways that were also useful to the organism. The ""guts"" of the flagellar mechanism is a secretory system, and the ""tail"" is the same stuff as cytoskeleton. There's no reason at all that the parts could not exist (and be selected FOR) before the flagellum existed. (This is co-option or exaptation.) Behe then changed his definition to overcome the problem of having systems that fit the original definition but whose evolution could be explained by scaffolding and co-option/exaptation. The problem was that the redefinition didn't do anything, it just pushed the requirement back a bit to what Behe arbitrarily called the ""irreducible core."" It essentially said, ""Go back far enough, and you'll not have an explanation for some things."" Such an argument falls prey to the very same reasoning that doomed his original definition. Dembski tried to save IC by redefining it again. He used Behe's original example of a three-legged stool to demonstrate his redefinition. Behe considered a three-legged stool irreducibly complex: remove any leg or the seat, and the stool fails to function. (Nevermind that the pieces might be somehow useful elsewhere, because that has been addressed.) Dembski pointed out that a simpler system would serve the same function: a seat being held up by a block. Thus, a three-legged stool is not IC, but a block that can serve as a butt-rest is. In order for something to be IC, Dembski said, there can't be any simpler system that serves that function. What Dembski is too dumb to understand is that his re-redefinition entirely abandons Behe's original intent, requires proving a universal negative (that no simpler system can serve the same function) to show that something is IC, and still doesn't sidestep the refutations of exaptation ! And if you don't believe my characterization of Dembski's re-redefinition, look it up on Dembski's blog! Arguing that the arising of an IC system via either scaffolding or exaptation is improbable is insufficient for maintaining that IC (of any definition!) presents a problem for modern evolutionary theory. It's equivalent to arguing that because the probability of hitting the Powerball jackpot is so low, nobody ever hits the Powerball jackpot.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:28 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","445"

"02-19-2010","12023",30,"Freedom","391138","Yes, that you contradicted yourself. Don't claim temporal abstract on the necessarily word, it will not strengthen your credibility to play word games. At what point would it become able to leave the host? or enter it? Both events with no imaginable precursor selectability. What help is a protein system that gets you inside or outside of a cell if it can't do it by itself? Note also that the system to move the organelle to the correct side of the dividing cell would be required for synchronized division to be a selective force, and that the selection of such a system would only be a force if cell division was synchronous. That is the nature of IC, a system whose evolution NOT formation cannot be subdivided.","Databed","391189","Why can't I use words the way they were meant to be used? You know full well that I have never claimed evolution to always evolve more complex or always evolve less complex. Show me where I said that please. This is a debating tactic you are using to try to misrepresent what I have said. Such an event does not need to be selected for. You clearly do not understand evolution if your contention is that no function can arise without first being selected for. What happens when the organelle doesn't make it to both sides? One side lives and one dies. This is easy to see how evolution could perfect the system. You could have only synchronized meiosis first, selected for because it increase the chances that both dividing halves of the cell get the organelles they need - but no separation mechanism. One cell would die if it didn't get any organelles and the living cell would have to grow and try again. This wouldn't be very good for survival, but all that has to happen to improve the system is the separation mechanism. Also, it is very likely that whatever was triggering the meiosis was very similar for both organelles and host cells. Further, at the time these functions were first evolving, there could have been many more organelles than current cells have. This would have been true so that both halves would surely get some. As soon as cell division became more efficient, the number of organelles would have been reduced. There is no such thing as IC. If Behe can't come up with an IC system, why do you think that you can?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:48 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","449"
