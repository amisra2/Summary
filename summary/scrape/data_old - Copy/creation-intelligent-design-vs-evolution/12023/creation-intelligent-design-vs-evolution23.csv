Evolutionist have no choice but to choose random result, ID advocates choose to name an intelligent force. I believe in ID, but not because any evidence in biology has pointed to it. (as they have said a lack of evidence is not evidence for) It is simply easier for the evolutionist to imagine methods around irreducible complexity after life has formed, it does not change the nature of the assessment. Yes, I don't know if you saw the documentary in which this was said but Richard Dawkins was talking about asteroids and other planets as the source of life. Like I said the biggest irreducability block yet found is the origin. I believe you misunderstood me, I was identifying a consequence of the theory of evolution. It is my contention that the reason origin is their weakest spot is the concept of irreducible complexity.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:35 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","332"

My only contention, not with you, but with biology is that is it possible that if biologists were not constrained to looking at Only a naturalistic explanation could they find evidence supporting ID and a scientific explanation of OOI that is not full of holes. The problem of science where OOI is concerned is that science sees what we call the 'supernatural' and an 'Intelligent Designer' as 'religion' thus not 'scientifically' causative to OOI. Such narrow perspective is arrogance as there is no way man will choose to disassociate his limited intelligence with the obvious all-encompassing intelligence of the Intelligent Designer, be he God or some other name as he is known to himself. Such design would, at the very least, be quite 'natural' to the Designer. Thus the evolutionist will never accept the possibility of an Intelligent Designer. The evolutionist feels the elusive answer to OOI is right out there waiting to be found and with 'nearly infinite time available' time is on his side.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:46 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","333"

Why is it necessary to have to ""come from somewhere"", for if it came from 'somewhere', then can it not follow that it must have been created by another even higher being, and thus the question logically follows through infinity.

Attempting to convince oneself through say evidence especially in the spiritual and complex subject of religion itself is folly. One must have a strong personal faith for such to be true to themselves.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","10:23 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","336"

I think that is at least a cogent view point because despite the vast amount of amazing things we have seen in the universe we have never seen the combination of both complexity and order to form outside of our own intelligent works.

"02-14-2010","12023",23,"Freedom","390330","Attempts to defeat irreducible complexity usually consist of imagining a way that they could be arrived at but never without choosing another system to adapt. I wanted to imagine a way to have a Boeing 747 ""life form"" appear I could do it if I had the industrial revolution to work with, but not without. don't know why anyone hasn't pointed this out but LIFE is irreducibly complex, prior to the first cell there were no other systems to re adapt, there was no natural selection. self reproducing cell must have formed from the random interaction of particles.","Larni","390380","Not sure what you mean, here. For evolution to take place it needs a system to adapt. It sounds as if you are saying that challenges to IC involve the use of evolutionary theory; but of course they do. Sorry I cannot see your point here, either. Having a previous system in place for modification is exactly what descent with modification is. This is a PRATT (point refuted a thousand times). Before the first cell there was a cell like structure and before that there was a less cell like structure and so on till we get to something so far removed from a cell that you would not call it a cell. The problem you have here is your position that the first life was a modern cell. See above for why this is false. This is A level information, here (I think that is equivalent to American High School senior year).","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","06:40 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","338"

Thus using Occams Razor here, it appears that the simplest answer is that the Intelligent Designer always existed. In physics we use the razor to shave away metaphysical concepts. The canonical example is Einstein's theory of special relativity compared with Lorentz's theory that ruler's contract and clocks slow down when in motion through the ether. Einstein's equations for transforming spacetime are the same as Lorentz's equations for transforming rulers and clocks, but Einstein and Poincar recognised that the ether could not be detected according to the equations of Lorentz and Maxwell. By Occam's razor it had to be eliminated.","Accipiter","390389","What is Occam's Razor?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:52 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","341"

The use of a snowflake (in the preceding post) to exhibit the 'naturalistic' tendencies of nature is, at best, somewhat juvenile.
