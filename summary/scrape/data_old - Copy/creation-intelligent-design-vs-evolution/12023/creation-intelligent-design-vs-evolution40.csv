You will have to keep rejecting the message of truth till the day you die to escape it. The love I have experienced is worth more than I have imagined possible. I'm a level headed guy of 32 who was successful in life but never really happy. I thought with who I was behind closed doors that there was no way for me to live up to this thing called Christianity but what I found is that I didn't have to. He does it all and I see what everyone who knows Him talks about now. It's like I had a blind fold on and through that experience I referred to, I now see. I know it sounds cliche but I promise you my friend it's soooooo true.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","586"

Hard to explain. Sceptics think we are crazy but there seems no cure for this madness","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:14 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","587"

If you seek God and you don't find Him you have lost zero but when you seek and find then you'll never be the same! Its only been a year since I met Jesus and I feel that I just started living my life! This has been the greatest undertaking and change that I ever thought was real. There is a reason you keep running into Christ because He loves you bro and that is what is real. I only know this from stepping out in faith and chasing after God. It's not fake and phony it's alive and well! I guarantee you if you seek Him you will definitely find Him I promise you my friend.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","589"

Did it ever occur to you that you should try to live up to your ideal and succeeding at that is what would make you happy?","Riverarod","392331","I don't understand your question, but explain it to me and I will be more than happy to answer you.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","590"
"02-24-2010","12023",40,"None","None","None","Riverarod","392345","Well my friend, In the Catholic faith what is the basis there in? How do you say that the Lord has not met with me when you nothing of which I am talking about? I'm not of the Catholic faith. Who ever said that the catholic faith is the correct faith? Have you ever read the Bible all the way through from front to back with an open mind, allowing God to speak to you? I promise you friend, God does speak to every man individually if you put yourself in the place to hear. God Bless","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:24 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","592"

"02-24-2010","12023",40,"Freedom","392327","As I said I do not prove negatives, how does common descent mean the theory of evolution?","Databed","392355","You lose. Too many non-substantiated responses. I'm done with you.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","594"

The Catholic faith if you've studied it are missing some sound principles. The truth of the matter is you seem to be missing some key things yourself on how to make God available to you. I only know this because the Holy Spirit Himself has revealed them to me. You have to be willing to discard all prior beliefs you may have about the Bible and Choose to accept it as truth, Complete truth! God cannot occupy where doubt lives. The righteous shall live by faith the word says and until you humble yourself and realize you need God is when He shows up. I can't interpret my experience for you but I can only tell you that He speaks to me and until you take those steps to make yourself available to Him then the fault is only yours. The instruction has been given to you on how to meet with God, its up to you to make the effort.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","01:46 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","596"
"02-25-2010","12023",40,"romebigred","392385","I would still follow it, because living the way I believe now makes me happier, more at peace than I was before. I believe it. Yet I cannot blame you for not believing it. Religion is, and always will be, a personal choice.","Riverarod","392386","Brother you encouraged me! I thank you for your words of encouragement in Christ! It is true. This walk is simply believing and trusting and surrender which is the hardest thing for us as humans to do. If we would simply believe then we could truly walk in our full potential as being made in the image of God! The way He intended!
