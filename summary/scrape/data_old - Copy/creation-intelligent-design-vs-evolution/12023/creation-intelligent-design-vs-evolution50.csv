"03-06-2011","12023",50,"Bennedict","425389","now youre just being obtuse, not to mention contradictory. my mousetrap is not a co-option, although it changes function, because it already had the potential to perform this function (duh. if it performs a function that it did not previously, that is a co-option. it has nothing to do with what the feature can potentially do previous to the co-option.), whereas the syringe example is also not a co-option, but the fact that it is not only potentially able to perform the new function, but it also does (i thought specifics were not considered - ""As many things as a fast triggered snapping action can be useful for."" remember? - rotation is rotation. how many things can a rotating secretory system be used for? as many things as a rotating mechanism can be useful for. propulsion is a specific.) makes it somehow different. i would disagree. something is not IC if an evolutionary pathway can be drawn between one thing and another - the basis of the IC argument, afterall is that something performing a function which could not have evolved, as it is too complex. thus, providing an evolutionary pathway would null the basis of the argument. even the fact that it could have evolved in such a way is enough to discount the IC argument, seeing as the argument is an absolute.","Freedom","425391","Rofl, powered rotation is powered rotation. A pepple falling from a cliff is not a car wheel spinning. A rotating socket has absolutely no ability to produce propulsion. The argument allows 'cannot' only as final evaluation of the odds. No one can claim something cannot happen unless they put some sort of laws on what sequences mutation can form (which no one has done). However what is very clear after the conclusion of the IC analysis is that natural selection is doing about zero in the way of producing novel systems which means you actually have to start considering the odds (You didn't need to before as natural selection filtered uncertainty to inevitability). It is very easy to say therefore if a system is complex enough the odds are practically impossible. It is even easier to say that the total complexity of all life is several orders of magnitude greater than any individual system. This is fully realized by at least Behe as his second book concentrates entirely on the odds. He wouldn't do that if he thought IC had discarded random formation.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","11:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","736"
"03-10-2011","12023",50,"Peeling","425400","I don't know why you think you can change my argument to suit yourself. I surmise that functional genes are sufficiently clustered as to explain the existence of life in its current forms, no more, no less. Functional gradients are not single strings If fitness gradients in gene space were arranged by chance, it would be impossible to locate them via any means other than a brute-force search of gene space. I neither expect nor require mutations to 'as oft as not' fall upon another function or system. Functional gradients are not single strings, and individual mutations are often observed to affect multiple aspects of an organism, proving beyond doubt the reality of co-option. And again, I remind you that to describe something as 'unlikely' you must be able to demonstrate the extent to which the phenomenon is subject to chance. Since you do not seem to be advocating any kind of infinite universe/multiverse explanation for the existence of life, it follows you are (at least unconsciously) assuming some lawful pattern to their arrangement permitting shortcuts to their discovery. So, given that we both require some unknown law to arrange gene-space to suit our hypotheses, you may want to reconsider your implication that this implies insanity. Connect or bring within plausible reach, yes. Nor is this a 'replacement' for evolutionary theory, any more than the supposition that the gene-function mapping preserves homologies 'replaces' evolutionary theory. It is merely a prerequisite; context - just as the details of carbon-based chemistry are part of the context - within which evolution is possible. I'm playing by your explicit rules here. You stated that your categorisation of selectable function was not arbitrary, but was the most general possible description of what a biological system achieved. That is, without exception or question: ""Aids survival/reproduction[/i]."" If you wish to disagree, then you must either show how a system which does not aid survival or reproduction may be consistently selected for, or give a still more generic description of functionality. You're starting to trip yourself up. In your discussion with Benedict, you insist that it is not the specific ways in which a system actually helps an organism that define its function, but what it is in capable of, regardless of whether that functionality is leveraged. Earlier you cherry-picked 'flying vehicle' as the most generic description for a plane, because you have (for some reason) decided that flight constitutes a 'new function' which is not allowed to evolve stepwise (although you have been very quiet on the subject of small ground-based mammals gradually improving their ability to leap and glide through adaptations to their limbs and skin). But why not 'vehicle'? Vehicles of many kinds can take you all over the world, helping in exactly the same way as planes. Perhaps not to the same degree or with the same level of convenience, but degree doesn't constitute a change in function, right? Not directly, to my knowledge. You recall the screwdriver/knife/spoon/hammer analogy from before? Not all functions need directly support co-option for them to be ultimately linkable. It's hard to answer that question when it's unclear what, to you, constitutes the 'forming' of C functionality. For instance, take a mammal evolving smaller and lighter (in the pursuit of some ecological niche) such that its surface area becomes capable of significantly slowing its fall. Does this constitute the formation of new functionality (gliding, the prelude to flight), or would you say that, since the surface area of a creature always provides air resistance, it 'always' possessed that functionality, albeit in a quantity too small and too swamped by other selection factors to itself be selectable? My question was my answer. You keep going on about how unlikely this all is, yet you refuse to provide a single example where co-option is impossible - or even unlikely. Thus I ask again: if your objection to co-option is that it's unlikely , how unlikely do you think it is for (say) mammals to evolve smaller in pursuit of an ecological niche, and thus encounter an opportunity to evolve flight? Because you keep saying co-option is unlikely. =Peeling;425400We might as well stop there. By specifying a single goal at the outset you invalidate the analogy. In evolutionary theory the flagellum was not an 'ultimate goal'. It's merely something which turned out to be possible to reach. You call that 'chance'; I have already explained why that cannot be the case regardless of how you believe the flagellum came to pass. 1. A chance arrangement of functional gradients is not navigable by anything other than a brute force search. 2. The more rare you insist instances of co-option must be, the more profoundly significant empirical examples of sequential evolutionary function changes such as the flagellum becomes, since if nature did not have to rely upon co-option to form novel systems we would never expect to see a false positive by chance .","Freedom","425566","Sorry for the long response time. I too will do some rearranging. On what evidence? That life exists? I see some contradiction on the fitness landscape here, if you neither expect nor require mutations to 'as oft as not' fall upon another function or system and thereby accept that the ratio we observe is more or less correct you are forced to admit not only that the vast majority of sequences are non-functional but also that the vast majority of known functional sequences are isolated in most directions from other systems. In the fitness landscape this along with the assumption of co-option allows only one class of terrain, a web of well strings. These strings may be far wider than just one sequence at a time but they would be strings. I do not assume that gradients themselves have no pattern, I have said explicitly before that I think it is eminently predictable that slight modifications of an existing system would most likely produce a variant system, this is not a rule there are obviously exceptions but it can still be assumed. In the fitness landscape that is like saying that (lets just take higher to mean greater fitness) we can count on functions being more or less hill shaped. The fact that mutations most often are neutral or negative means that we are not dealing with a giant mountain in which it's always up up up. Neutral means no change in height, i.e. a plateau. Negative means a loss in height, i.e. a valley. Co-option means that functions are connected by fitness gradients, so then we are talking about ridges in which the local path is high fitness but also the direction along the ridge is steep enough to move the sequence to another function. Your assumptions and accepted facts are working together to give you a pretty clear picture of the general geology of your fitness landscape and it does have 'strings'. While we are talking about this my point about co-option is that unlike the hills you are claiming that we have mountain ranges (i.e. a specific placement of functional gradients) but with no justification. Correlation of structure is fully accounted for in the fitness landscape as you would simply me observing valleys or heights that are the result of multiple structures. As I have said before co-option is at least as unlikely as equivalent mutation. That is not a specific number because the odds would change from system to system. Odds of mutation = 1/4^difference Odds of perfect co-option = 1/4^sequence length Difference < sequence length Therefore odds of mutation are always > odds of perfect co-option. Clearly imperfect co-option + odds of mutation = odds of perfect co-option as every degree (base pair) of imperfection in co-option is the same degree increase in differential. Clearly this assumes that the odds of co-option = 1/4^sequence length, that is a purely random view of the distribution of functions. How am I unconsciously assuming some lawful pattern? If I am does that exempt my point that no one has found one from validity? and finally what hypothesis are you talking about? My hypothesis is that evolution doesn't explain what people claim it explains. It is not just a prerequisite, if co-option is as you think of it, the traditional evolutionary mechanism is just a train that creeps along tracks of co-option. Still a factor of course but not the source of the so called 'information'. Theistic evolution supporters would just love this idea because it would mean that the 'information' for life was 'coded' into the universe. All of that is irrelevant at this point however because I am merely talking about the notion that the evolutionary mechanism (mutation + natural selection) is responsible for the advancement of life. If you manage to (I don't think you will) set up patterns of co-option as the explanation I will consider that a new theory or at least a substantial expansion of the theory. Alright, I am sorry if this seems like mincing words but I really did rely on such shades of meaning when in my original quote. I did not say the most general description of of what a biological systems achieves, you made that up. I said the most general description possible of a function. You are talking about the purpose of a structure, and in life it either aids in survival or is vestigial. A function in engineering and biology has a specific meaning, it is a process with an aim (to aid in survival) but the actual function part is the process which implies two things, what is done and how it is done. What is done need not be the ultimate purpose of the function and in life it cannot be, there is no structure that directly 'aids in survival' they all happen to do specific things that contribute to survival. It would by si-fi to imagine a system that generated some mystical life force. I would like to note that it is partially my fault if you misunderstood because my own example did a poor job illustrating this because obviously 'a flying vehicle' is not the function of a airplane; it's definition is: a heavier-than-air aircraft kept aloft by the upward thrust exerted by the passing air on its fixed wings and driven by propellers, jet propulsion, etc. The function is the what is done as well as how it is done, a plane is not a helicopter nor a airship. Furthermore this is in fact not the most general description of the function possible, because this still leaves the propulsion system undefined, a plane that has the propulsion of a propeller is not just another shape of a plane with a jet propulsion system. So another way you might define the difference between functions is that a function may have many variants but they are all just shapes of each other (I call these applications nowadays). A different function however, regardless of whether it happens to do the same thing must at least do so in a different way. Now I don't know how much of this thread you have read but the above including the comments about 'most general' are post hoc english extrapolations of the concept. In my guided mutation test the word 'function' doesn't even appear. The important part in that test is 'whether a mutation is selected due to similarity in the final'. Conceptually that is only possible because of converging on a biological function so that is why there is all this blabing about what functions are, if however you are going to get so precise with the wording I would just refer you to the definition that a function is a set of sequences with the same selection pressures (direction not magnitude). i.e. you can tell if you have left the function if the selective pressure being experienced is no longer based on how the structure used to aid in survival whether positive or negative. How is it possible that a function does not have co-option with itself? I am not sure what that means If satisfying B becomes strongly selected for, the structure can, through improvements to its B function, acquire slight C functionality The 'acquire C functionality' would be the formation, degree is important only if it is too slight to experienced selection and that is not an assumption that can really be made in general. It's always possessed air resistance that is true, however the smaller and lighter selective force has nothing to do with that (I assume); in the guided mutation test it would fail the 'selected for similarity with B' so regardless of whether the function could be said to exist or not it would not being selected so it could not be guided. i.e. it is a coincidence that being smaller and lighter has brought the creature closer to flight. The formation of a new function would be before the moment when the first selection occurs due to the ability to glide by definition, however that selection is the proof that the function does exist. So the creature always possessed air resistance but not always the ability to glide. The ability to glide is formed when the creature doesn't just fall slow, when it actually travels distance, and the proof that this function exists to evolution is when it can select for it. I hope you can see the difference between this and the hypothetical cases that bennedict brought, in which the function already existed and merely became more useful (therefore selectively emphasized) due to some environmental shift. That would be in this example that the mammal could already glide but for some reason it was more important to run quietly until it migrated to somewhere with tons of trees or cliffs. i.e. just because the function is not being used does not mean it does not exist, however the inability to select for the function despite it's potential usefulness is proof that it does not exist yet. Is it impossible or just unlikely that a mammal to have an offspring which has gained the use of flight which it's parents did not have? Ah but for that I only need to assume forward connections are unlikely not backward connections. I think most systems preserve old functions to some degree easily, that does not mean that the old functions have anywhere near sufficient sequence homology with the new ones. For instance (I don't remember who gave this example) someone on this forum came up with the example of QWERTY key arrangement on a keyboard and a type writer, noting that a keyboard has preserved the 'functionality' of QWERTY is easy, it is like saying that a section of the DNA for a keyboard codes for the QWERTY system; that in no way however proves that any amount of finagling with a type writer will produce a computer system. This is a very important part of the claimed co-option method of generation referred conveniently as 'association' in which control systems gene expression and luck all combine to allow elements from all over organisms to combine to form a new function, this is the height of the unlikeliness I am talking about. By specifying a single goal I am reflecting that the flagellum or the piece setup is claimed to have evolve, it is perfectly legitimate in every way. If you want to consider every system and not just one that is fine, but then we will consider the odds of producing every system in life and not just one. How are you going to do that besides breaking it into individual chances? and so? So you are saying that the more rare I insist co-option is the more important it is that you find examples of it because we would not expect examples to exist? You realize that it is precisely the failure to predict the phenomenon that is the basis for my dismissal of the concept right?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","04:10 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","738"
