I simply believe ID since your have NOT shown anything to the contrary.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:06 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","346"
"02-14-2010","12023",24,"Esdraelon","390413","If the simplest thing is no designer, then you are back to a paradox in that you have life, but no scientific explanation of life except conjectures and hypothesises. The necessity of 'high school biology' teaching conjecture is that evolutionists are backed up against the wall with their pants down, sic, when they arrive at OOI. To them, this is completely unacceptable, much like AGW 'scientists' being stymied by the recent 10 year cooling period, cannot explain it, and find it totally unacceptable. The 'simplest thing' is just to admit you don't know.","Larni","390431","Your error here is to say that no scientific explanation at this moment in time means no scientific explanation ever. I don't get your point. Who is saying anything other than ""We don't know""? As far as I'm aware nobody 'knows' exactly how life originated. But what we do know is adding extraneous entities (such as supernatural beings) does not help our understanding one iota. When a scientist does not know something they are not 'backed up against the wall'. That is the challenge every scientist revels in. Trying to understand what is yet unknown is the point of science. Getting to a point where there are questions we can't answer yet (such as the mechanism for the origin of life) is what keeps scientist doing research and hard work to answer those questions.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","347"
"02-14-2010","12023",24,"Esdraelon","390354","Irreducible complexity is not an obstruction to ID for the simple reason that any being with such command of the naturalistic processes IS by definition ""several orders of magnitude"" more complex, likely an infinite order of magnitudes, than its supposed designs. Why is it necessary to have to ""come from somewhere"", for if it came from 'somewhere', then can it not follow that it must have been created by another even higher being, and thus the question logically follows through infinity. Thus using Occams Razor here, it appears that the simplest answer is that the Intelligent Designer always existed.","trebor","390432","How is that 'simpler'?? Oh, and it has been demonstrated, in the laboratory, with repeatable and testable experiments that 'IC' systems, per Behe's definition,can evolve naturally.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","348"
"02-14-2010","12023",24,"Penfold","390421","If the simplest thing is to admit that you don't know (which is what evolution does) then introducing a magical causation with no evidence is false.","Esdraelon","390433","So according to you, evolution admits it doesn't know? Funny, as far back when I was in grade school, back in the early 70's, evolution was taught as a FACT which has been the case ever since. The 'magical causation' was not 'introduced' as it was around long before 'scientists' were little more than astrologers. You know, it is truly simple to presume descent from common ancestor since it could also be said that if an Intelligent Designer created all things that those things not need to be that much different RNA/DNAwise to be completely and radically different. Evolutionists love to claim how 'close' the DNA of chimps are to man when actually its the difference from the earth to the moon. 'Close' is completely meaningless in molecular biology.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:19 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","349"
"02-14-2010","12023",24,"Esdraelon","390414","True, Occam's Razor can also be used to shave down OOI to it's simplest but once you have done that, you don't know where you are or where you go from there. The use of a snowflake (in the preceding post) to exhibit the 'naturalistic' tendencies of nature is, at best, somewhat juvenile. Comparing the result of a drop of H2O when it is frozen, or a film of water on a windshield taking a 'naturalistic' tendency when it freezes? THIS is presented as a naturalistic comparison to OOI?","Larni","390434","A snow flake is not an example of complexity from an un-designed (random) cause?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:19 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","350"

ToE is not concerned with the Origin question any more than Psychology is concerned with atomic theory. Evolution is taught as fact but the mechanism of abiogenesis is not yet known You are also confused with astrologers. They did not use the scientific method. You also confuse the use of the word 'introduced' (as in extraneous variables into a system) with introduced (as in a cultural concept).","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:29 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","352"

The laws of nature govern that processes such as the creation of snowflakes, sic, are endlessly repeated whenever the natural processes are conductive to such creation. 'Life' however, is a paradox, and if you presume to use the snowflake analogy you fall into error as common descent infers that all life came from one single cell, in which life happened by the merest chance. I truly have my doubts that man will ever solve that riddle.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","354"

It has been demonstrated that there is decent with modification, and that this can cause new species to arise. That is the fact of evolution.
