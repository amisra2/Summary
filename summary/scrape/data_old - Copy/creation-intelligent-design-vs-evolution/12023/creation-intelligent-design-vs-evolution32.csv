"02-20-2010","12023",32,"Freedom","391303","Yes, or more precisely that there was no intermediate functionality for NS to work on to arrive at modern complexity. You can't prove it so we are left with data analysis and thought exercise, all of evolution consist of those two things. Why can't the same be used to refute it? Conceiving of a way evolution could produce an IC system disproves the entire point conceiving of a way a IC system could be produced doesn't. Scaffolding assumes that selection is not necessary for interaction, scaffolding takes it as a granted that systems will change function because of mutation, why is this different from mutation? 1) link to data? 2) relevance? I was responding to each paragraph individually when I realized that the main point I was making was going to be lost in the smaller ones and that you would feel safe attacking those. How did the CPS protein acquire the third piece of functionality? If your answer is a single mutation that is exactly what IC predicts is neccessary. You are using the arguements I have identified several times and refuted. Natural selection of a system that does not exist, what do you mean by that? Second by moving the burden of randomness from the mutation to the parts of a system it appears as if you have solved the odds problem, NS cannot work on parts that aren't yet functioning any more than it can work on a mutation that has not yet occurred. Parts can be refined for a function but the direction of that refinement CANNOT be towards a system that does not exist except by random chance. No reason at all, but we aren't talking about them being selected for are we? his original definition was sound except that he should have clarified that it is not the functionality that is irreducible but the selection for that functionality. Ok, I'll take your word on it. It is sufficient to me. I am glad you realize probability is the core of my arguement, do you realize anti-probability is the core of evolution?","electrolyte","391399","Right: according to the ID caricature of stepwise evolution, an IC system can't be built stepwise because the reduced system allegely has no functionality. Even if we assume that the reduced IC system has no functionality, it does not follow that the components have no function. Thus these structures are prone to selection pressures. It seems that your argument is that without natural selection driving the formation of the IC system from pre-existing components, the probability of the system being built from those otherwise non-interacting components is very small. But so is hitting the Powerball jackpot, and there are only two per week. See law of large numbers. Either could be used to refute it if either has any meat to it. Yours doesn't. Not all of evolution consists of those two things. Statements like that make me want to stop treating you as someone who is capable of understanding this topic. You claim that we can't prove that evolution is capable of doing this, but even the thought experiment shows that it can. Nevermind that we have the evidence that it has happened. If I've interpreted this mess of English correctly, then I agree! The issue is that I have conceived of a way that evolution could produce an IC system. (Okay, I wasn't the first person to do this, but still...) You object because it doesn't involve natural selection selecting FOR that system, and you think that this missing characteristic means that evolution can't do it. In reality, it means nothing of the sort. Hey, I agree that scaffolding can take place with mutation of components and without selection FOR a system that doesn't exist. Are you agreeing with me? Additionally, it's possible that the system might change function without even a mutation in a coding sequence of any of those components but via a mutation in any targeting system. Sorry, got this from a real book: Biochemistry , Berg, J.M., et al, 5th ed. Freeman. (p 695) Real world example of conceptual disproof of IC ""hurdle."" Aren't you paying attention? I feel safe attacking any idiocy. My answer is not a single mutation, it is a number of mutations. Either way, though, your assertion is purely false. IC doesn't predict anything. Why would a single mutation difference either support or challenge claims of IC? Bullspit. You say that you've identified these arguments and refuted them, and then you say, which shows that not only have you not refuted it, but you haven't identified it because you don't even understand it. Having this discussion without understanding the difference between selection FOR and selection OF is like bringing a knife to a gunfight. A pocketknife. A mini pocketknife. Let's use a very simple model. Suppose that allele A imparts characteristics X and Y upon the possessing organism. Suppose characteristic X presents a favorable selection pressure upon that organism. Characteristic X is selected FOR, meaning that allele A is selected FOR. But because allele A is selected FOR, characteristic Y experiences the same effect of being selected for even though there was no selection for characteristic Y. Characteristic Y has been selected; i.e. there was selection OF Y. I've done neither, exactly. Mutation of some sort can still play a part, but we don't need the multiple simultaneous mutations that the IC proponent claims are needed. Odds were never a problem; people still play Powerball. 1. NS (+RM) isn't the only mechanism of evolution. 2. The parts are functioning, just not originally as the new system. I agree with what you mean but not with one interpretation of what you have said. NS cannot direct refinement based on the fitness conferred by a nonexistent system, but it can direct refinement (1) based on fitness conferred by an existing system and (2) in a way that happens to lead to new function. I explain this because there is not necessarily no relationship between the two, meaning that the ""random chance"" here is not very similar to the ""random chance"" of multiple simultaneous mutations or even of a single point mutation in ""just the right spot."" Yes, we are. There is a fitness benefit to having these structures that IC proponents argue can't be expected to confer a fitness benefit because the IC system isn't fully built. I agree that his first definition was the least troublesome of the three (for the IC/ID proponents), but that doesn't make it any less flawed. I understand perfectly what his point was/is. The fact that it was (is) flawed is what led to his redefinition. Seriously: even Behe realized that his original definition was insufficient for proving his point. But you don't have to. You can look it up right on his blog. Of course, Dembski's being an XXXXX doesn't really refute Behe's original idea, but the fact that Dembski felt the need to re-revise Behe's definition might be interpreted as being indicative of a problem. Of course it's sufficient for you . You can't connect dots. You say that NS can't favor nonexistent or nonfunctional systems, which is true. You conclude that evolution can't build systems that have intermediate or incomplete forms that are nonfunctional. We provide examples of ways that evolution can do this, and you hand-wave it away. Yes, and no. Yes, probability is the core of your argument, meaning that it's an argument from incredulity, as others have already pointed out. And no, anti-probability is not the core of evolution. It's pretty damn dumb to make that argument, too, as if there's no positive evidence for evolution. This is why many educated people can't take evolution deniers seriously. The sheer abundance of the obtuse character of your argumentation is difficult to stomach.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","01:26 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","468"

The youtube video has more problems than can be counted not the least of which is that is about a clock. I glanced at his code, so I am not going just by what was in the video. Simply put this algorithm was designed to succeed, note when he called people who thought this ignorant. Insults are usually targeted towards the threat. 1.) Functionality already existed, review all my arguements for why this is not what I am speaking about. Whats that? he didn't start it off as a clock? no but every single permutation told time, or else he could not calculate which one told it the worst. In fact his code doesn't even allow clocks that don't tell time through the evolution matrix. 2.) Functionality was predefined, note how he had components and random elements but that the randomness never extended beyond scalars. I will some day create a algorithm of my own to prove to myself one way or the other. It will consist of random base code and the final result will not be predictable by the simplest analysis. The clock example was somewhat hard to comprehend in relation to evolution, let me identify a program that would show the same result for the same reasons. A series of 250 numbers are generated called number A, a second number B is generated, number B is copied twice forming two permutations changing one digit for each, the permutation which is less numerically identical to number A is deleted and the other is copied again. This will continue until number A equals number B, that will not convince me evolution is true, nor does it account for IC.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","479"
