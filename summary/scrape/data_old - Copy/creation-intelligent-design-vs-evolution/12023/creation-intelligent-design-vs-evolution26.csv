I did not imply that the only reason one would not believe in evolution is religion even though it probably accounts for 99% people who dont believe in evolution.

"02-14-2010","12023",26,"Larni","390463","I don't see what observation is being side stepped. Please explain what observation is being side stepped. This can be resolved by scaffolding. A system with function A becomes redundant and then looses components to become useful in a different domain. The point is that function of a system can change from the original function. No I'm not. That's not what I'm doing. Please show me where I have done this. I would say nothing of the sort. I would say that structure A has lost systems that acted as a scaffold and so it only looks IC. Bottom line is that IC is an argument from incredulity. Yes, natural selection needs something to work on but mutations always occur and it is only a matter of time till NS 'detects' it and selects for it. More likely it was RNA. You don't need a cell to have RNA (or DNA). So you say that there must be a designer if there is a design? Circular logic. When scientist talks about a 'design' they do not mean 'made by a designer'. It is a figure of speech. Ask yourself why an 'evolutionist' so intent on evolution would actual mean such a thing literally. Substantiate or withdraw your assertion. A car shows evidence of design such as serial numbers. Life does not. Please show evidence of design in something not made by humans. You are the one adding the extraneous variable into the equation. You are the one claiming that a designer must be there for life to work. I say life works without one. We already know that life functions; you have to substantiate your claim that it requires a designer. You are in a sense asking me to prove a negative. This cannot be done. I'm asking you to substantiate a positive. No idea what you mean by this. Have you read it? I can't believe someone who has would make such an assertion. Darwin's book deals with evolution not abiogenesis. The existence of the supernatural is not taken into consideration, either for or against as to science it is not relevant. Even the Pope believes in evolution. What are these scientist claiming? I'm still in the dark. Yes it is. Imperfect replication and natural selection. This is not what ToE predicts. You are imagining hopeful monsters.","Freedom","390479","That natural selection cannot act to improve functionality that does not exist. You merely restated the ""already existing"" attack I refuted, the problem is not where the genetic material will come from it's why it will form an irreducible system. Not you personally people of like mind attempting to defend against IC Exactly as I predicted: presupposing system A or it's components already existed. I give credit where credit is due. I stand confused, by that statement you obviously understand what I am saying why do you deny that IC is a problem to evolution? You don't need a cell for a great number of biological functions, does that mean life can occur in solution? Argument by definition is more accurate. Design is a verb, the Design the object is an object of design the verb. 9. an outline, sketch, or plan, as of the form and structure of a work of art, an edifice, or a machine to be executed or constructed. 10. organization or structure of formal elements in a work of art; composition. 11. the combination of details or features of a picture, building, etc.; the pattern or motif of artistic work: the design on a bracelet. 12. the art of designing: a school of design. 13. a plan or project: a design for a new process. 14. a plot or intrigue, esp. an underhand, deceitful, or treacherous one: His political rivals formulated a design to unseat him. 15. designs, a hostile or aggressive project or scheme having evil or selfish motives: He had designs on his partner's stock. 16. intention; purpose; end. 17. adaptation of means to a preconceived end. A figure of speech that includes only life and our creations, I've never heard anyone talk about the ""design"" of a planet, the ""design"" of the clouds, or a ""design"" of volcanoes. Design it seems is used when something has a purpose and a goal. There is no purpose to a stone, the purpose of life is to live. Because: ""this random mutation allows the frog to thrive in swamp environments"" sounds ridiculous compared to ""this design allows the frog to thrive in swamp environments."" It was a generalization not an assertion, and it's obviously correct. We cannot predict weather exactly too many components, the sun is superheated chaotic plasma, small number of atoms in molecules produce simpler shaped crystals. What's a serial number got to do with it? it's got more numbers than that it's got a computer the manual all the information on the dash. What makes you think that shows it is design? Like? Where? I didn't make that claim Evolution is not a negative What positive? You said it was an error to claim that no scientific explanation means there will never be one, that is true. It is also an error to claim that no scientific explaintion means science can come to any conclusion on the subject. Have you read the title? I know he doesn't deal with the origin of life but the common teaching is that evolution covers that. Then don't take it into consideration. I doubt that That the origin and/or advancement of life has been explained scientifically Did nothing of what I said about irreducible complexity make it to your mind? Imperfect replication minus natural selection is what we have in these cases. Evolution as the theory stands cannot explain advancement life. Then the theory of evolution does not explain new functionality as I claimed.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:29 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","378"

I know he doesn't deal with the origin of life but the common teaching is that evolution covers that. Then don't take it into consideration. I doubt that In an October 22, 1996, address to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Pope John Paul II updated the Church's position to accept evolution of the human body: ""In his encyclical Humani Generis (1950), my predecessor Pius XII has already affirmed that there is no conflict between evolution and the doctrine of the faith regarding man and his vocation, provided that we do not lose sight of certain fixed points....Today, more than a half-century after the appearance of that encyclical, some new findings lead us toward the recognition of evolution as more than a hypothesis. In fact it is remarkable that this theory has had progressively greater influence on the spirit of researchers, following a series of discoveries in different scholarly disciplines. The convergence in the results of these independent studies which was neither planned nor sought constitutes in itself a significant argument in favor of the theory.""[16] In the same address, Pope John Paul II rejected any theory of evolution that provides a materialistic explanation for the human soul: ""Theories of evolution which, because of the philosophies which inspire them, regard the spirit either as emerging from the forces of living matter, or as a simple epiphenomenon of that matter, are incompatible with the truth about man."" lThat the origin and/or advancement of life has been explained scientifically Did nothing of what I said about irreducible complexity make it to your mind?

Then the theory of evolution does not explain new functionality as I claimed.","Larni","390505","I'm going to have to assume I'm understanding you right so bear with me if I'm barking up the wrong tree. Your point here is that NS 'works' when some system in the organism has a negative reproductive value. So if a bird has an non fatal mutation that impedes it's ability to feed (and subsequently breed) the genes will be removed from the gene pool. This is how NS works. It does not select for things. It selects against things. You point seems to be that random mutation and NS i.e. evolution, does not account for novel functionality. I hope I understand you correctly. Please look at the eye. This shows how ToE and new functionality go hand in hand. Evolution of the eye - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia An argument from incredulity is a logical fallacy, rather than giving credit where it is due. It means that as one can't imagine how something could work (it) cannot work. This is what you appear to be saying. IC is not a problem for evolution for two reasons. If it was true it would not prevent evolution from acting on the 'designed' system. The second reason is that IC requires a designer which must be many times more IC than the system in question. Who designed the designer? This is infinite regression of designer, each one more IC than the next. Independent RNA based life is consistent with the RNA world hypothesis I previously linked. Sophistry. Your point remains circular. It's still a figure of speech rather formal usage. This is the very definition of an argument from incredulity: a logical fallacy. All you have said here is that it obviously correct. You need to support your position with evidence. Cars have serial numbers because they are designed. You asked my how I would tell if it is designed. That's how I would know. The point is we know what designed things look like because we see evidence of design e.g. serial numbers. There is no evidence of design in nature. The designer (or it's own infinite designers) are the extraneous variable(s). Then you agree a designer is not required for life? Good. I apologise for my inference. That is not what I meant. Under the scientific methodology one never attempts to prove a negative i.e. one attempts to falsify ones hypotheses. That's what I meant. Again, sorry if I've misinterpreted you: we currently do not have a complete theory of abiogenesis. But that does not rule out that in the future we may have. Just like at one time we did not have germ theory or electromagnetism; now we do. That's the great thing about science; it pushes the horizons of our ignorance back every year. The ToE makes no reference to abiogenesis (high school text books not withstanding). But to pick this point up, high school text book say elections are discrete particles (rather than excitation of the EM field). Some things are kept simple for kids. I've under the assumption that you and I are discussing at a post graduate level. I don't. Nor does any scientist. It is just not relevant to the research. It is not ruled out any more than Loki is specifically ruled out. It is about as important to science as Zeus. You are in for a shock then. Catholic Church and evolution - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia The origin of life is not ToE and I have already stated that the current knowledge on abiogenesis means the best we can say today is 'we don't know'. But taking out NS does not happen in nature. The only way you could do that would be in an experiment. What would that show us. Every replicator that has to compete for resources and replicates imperfectly has NS acting on it. Even as you read this the words I write are undergoing NS as you select the sentences that are of more interest to you. If I wrote nothing of interest you would not reply and my out put would decline. For my conversation to you to survive I would have to write (by chance) things that catch your attention. This is NS in action. Go back to the eye. Take it easy, freedom","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:06 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","385"
