"09-18-2010","12023",44,"Freedom","412817","beliefverb (used with object) 2. to have confidence or faith in the truth of (a positive assertion, story, etc.); give credence to. Are you saying using the word belief implies faith? I don't think you can say 'science is fundamentally true', it's a method not a statement.","Bennedict","412827","that question... youve already answered it. but no, i was not implying that, i was saying that one can have a belief one way or another when it comes to religion whereas with science, you either recognize that it is the current extent of our knowledge about the universe or you havent been learned enough about science. im not implying that you are in the latter category either, just those who apparently reject all things that have to do with science, almost always in replacement for religious answers. to answer your question of how i would define 'creationist', someone with the argument that life has been created by a higher being. and ive already mentioned elsewhere to you that different creationists view creation differently, so that answer may seem vague, which it is. some will think all life has been created in it's current form whereas others (my personal favorites) will say that this higher being created the basic lifeforms and allowed them to evolve from there. why cant i say that science is fundamentally true? with the knowledge that we have currently, combined with the current technology and our current findings and evidence, its the truest method we have in understanding the universe. if science is not fundamentally true by the standards of our current knowledge, what is? should we just hang up our hats and say 'well, we will never know all the answers so theres no point in searching for them'? no.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","02:41 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","648"

"09-19-2010","12023",44,"None","None","None","gansao","412920","A belief system is a system that you believe in. Science is a system of observation and calculation. No one ' believes' in a theory. It is an explanation that fulfils certain criteria. No one ' believes' in a theorem either. It is a statement which has been proven on the basis of previously established statements.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:10 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","653"
"09-19-2010","12023",44,"Freedom","412898","What word would you use for 'think to be true'? (even when I was trying to think of the concept I wanted to say 'believe to be true'). I see, and what evidence do you have that I fit this definition? Well if you are using the word science in this context to be shorthand for 'the knowledge gained from science'. Otherwise you are saying that a method is true. It doesn't quite make sense, it's like saying driving is 'true' as opposed to driving works or driving is a valid way to move a car.","Bennedict","412952","another term besides 'think to be true' would be...acknowledge to be true, accept to be true, recognize to be true. some scientists will be misquoted in saying that 'science is believed to be true by society', but upon asking them if science is a belief based method of understanding, the answer is no. i apologize if i misunderstood you before, freedom. you clearly argue against evolution, and that usually leans towards arguing for creation. this forum is about evolution vs creation afterall, and a negativity towards evolution usually implies a positivity towards creation. youve also referred to something which you have coined 'guided mutation' or 'guided variation' which if i understood you correctly earlier, refers to an intelligent being guiding variation among species in their evolutionary cycle. you have also defended ID when i confronted it in the thread 'how is ID useful?' you stood up for ID on many occasions in that thread. but for the record, what is your position? the entire purpose of science is to find the true - or truest answers for questions about the universe. when i say 'science is fundamentally true' i recognize that science is a method (as opposed to an action like driving) and that method is to find the truth about the universe. so far, with our current abilities, what we know to be true IS true. the laws of physics for example, although confusing, have been explained nearly without fault, so we can recognize them as being true - or the truest method of understanding physical properties. the same goes for all other areas of science - environmental, chemical, biological, etc. if something is found to be false in science, it is revised or replaced and then this new theory will be understood of as true. thus being said, there are controversies and arguments within science, but thats good for furthering what we understand about science. ID on the other hand is NOT a controversy, nor is it a very good argument.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","654"

"09-19-2010","12023",44,"Freedom","412968","So belief != 'think to be true'? You did not understand correctly. It was a conceptual tool I was using to illustrate that the distinction made by IC is definable and objective. Well I can see how one would be confused there, but in fact if you read carefully I was only attacking unsound attacks on ID, I never made a positive argument for it. I do the same thing for other subjects as well because the point of debate is to weed out incorrect logic (at least it is to me). I have attacked the unsound attacks that creationist have made against evolution such as 'no intermediate fossils' and 'where does the DNA come from'. My position on ID (for the record) is that the only evidence is a generalization which means it's still a hypothesis for now and probably will stay that way for a very long time. I reject, however; the notion that it is not a valid hypothesis for it certainly does explain what it claims to explain if it was true. That is actually in a better position than irrational evolution which I reject not because of a lack of evidence but because the hypothesis itself is invalid, i.e. it does not explain what it claims to. The final evaluation of my position is I don't know where life came from or how it advanced, and that doesn't bother me because there are a lot of things I don't know. I am content to never surrender to ignorance, and to always be vigilant for the truth. kk, so when you say science you mean the body of theories not the method.","Bennedict","412986","belief does not necessarily mean 'think to be true.' i think that belief in the context that we are talking about is faith oriented - and with faith implies that you believe something to be true just because. so i dislike the word faith more than i dislike the word believe, because faith is much less of a scientific term. you could use the word believe in science, by saying 'science is a method based on a belief system' but in that context again, faith is implied. IC is a tool used by ID proponents. also, IC has been completely disproven by the scientific community. i think it was disproven about 5 years ago or something - the scientific way of going about that sort of thing would be either to revise the theory to make it acceptable or to drop it altogether and start a new one. that's how its been done since Aristotle's time. ID proponents have done neither of those, just continuously push the idea of IC in different forms, all of which being disproven almost immediately as soon as they arise. this is another point as to why ID has no scientific validity - it doesnt follow the scientific method. if you would like to be vigilant for the truth and never surrender to ignorance, then read up on evolution before defending ID. have you read Origin of Species yet? you cant blame me for thinking that youre lying in saying that you are content to never surrender to ignorance. you havent read the main evolution literature, leading me to believe that you havent read any published evolutionary literature at all, yet you defend ID as if it is a valid theory that contends to Darwin's. that is ignorance in a nutshell, freedom. all creationists do the same. im not saying that ID is not a valid hypothesis, it isnt a valid scientific theory. i told you before that ive read a creationist book before (Darwin's Black Box by Michael Behe, in my naivety thinking it was a pro-evolution book, but i bit my tongue and read it anyways.) and evolution completely kills it. if i was talking about the scientific method, i would have said 'the scientific method is fundamentally true' which wouldnt make sense. but talking about science as a whole, it does make sense, as ive explained above.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","03:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","658"
