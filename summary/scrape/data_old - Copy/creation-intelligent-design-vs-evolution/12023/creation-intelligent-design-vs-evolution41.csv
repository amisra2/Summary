The only decent point you made Bigred is that if I proved your beliefs wrong, you would continue to believe them on the grounds that it has made your life better. I would contend that this is all in your head (you could have started yoga or something and gotten the same effect) and that the empirical data you speak of cannot be directly linked to divine intervention but only correlated with your changed outlook on life. That being said, we are way off topic and this form of talk is sickening.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:10 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","602"

Body parts such as eyes, muscle, bone, etc. We have not seen one instance of a new body part evolving in a population in which it has not existed previously. Evolutionists will wave the magic ""time wand"" and simply claim that such a change could never be observed in a few decades. What about fruit flies? One generation of fruit flies = around a day. Fruit flies were exposed to x rays to speed up mutation rates, we have observed the equivalent of millions of years (in terms of human generations) of super-accelerated mutation and.... no new body parts. Evolutionists will also list in steps how a new body part can arise. This is only plausible if each of those steps could be directly observed. If not, then it is nothing more than science fiction. Evolutionists have been searching for any direct evidence of the theory of evolution since the 1800's. They are still looking.","Bennedict","407751","in defense of the fruit fly, why would one evolve when one is already suited well to their environment? what good does a 7th leg do? and about the experiment itself - please, ALWAYS post references. who did the experiment? when? under what conditions? how? assuming you were correct about the experiment, were variables put in place such as habitat changes to reflect the timeline you speak of, a large variety of fruit flies to begin with, random mating, etc etc or did some people just shoot some x rays at a couple fruit flies, did some arithmetic which was probably wrong and called it that? and im sorry, but there is mountains of direct evidence for evolution, you just need to go and look at it.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:15 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","605"

Evolution is fun!","Larni","410077","More accurate to say that understanding ToE is hard work but understanding religion is easy: Compare, say a degree in evolutionary biology against believing in x. One can believe in x in a moment. It takes at least 3 years to get a degree.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:29 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","608"
