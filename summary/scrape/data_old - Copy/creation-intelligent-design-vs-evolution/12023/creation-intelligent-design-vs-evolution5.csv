Beside that, how would he get a group of evolutionists to objectively review his evidence when doing so honestly would be detrimental to their careers? Yet they will rubber stamp any pro-evolution papers since they support their preconceived notions. This is proven by all of the peer reviewed papers which have later been disproved by new evidence. Yet, notice that the peer reviewers of the prior bad science they endorsed are never challenged or called out for the process of rubber stamping bad science. The peer review system is rigged, plain and simple. Here is Wells bio, how does yours add up against it as you judge his work as faulty! Jonathan Wells has received two Ph.D.s, one in Molecular and Cell Biology from the University of California at Berkeley, and one in Religious Studies from Yale University. He has done postdoctoral research at the University of California at Berkeley, and has taught biology at California State University in Hayward. Dr. Wells has published articles in both scientific and religious journals including Development, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, BioSystems, American Presbyterians, and Patristic and Byzantine Review. He is also author of the book Charles Hodge's Critique of Darwinism (Edwin Mellen Press, 1988). He is a Senior Fellow at the Discovery Institute. Dr. Wells's work in developmental biology poses a serious challenge to the neo-Darwinian idea that random mutations can create new body plans and organisms. Since you refuse to answer my question regarding Homology, maybe you'll answer these? But I doubt it. ORIGIN OF LIFE. Why do textbooks claim that the 1953 Miller-Urey experiment shows how life's building blocks may have formed on the early Earth when conditions on the early Earth were probably nothing like those used in the experiment, and the origin of life remains a mystery? DARWIN'S TREE OF LIFE. Why don't textbooks discuss the ""Cambrian explosion,"" in which all major animal groups appear together in the fossil record fully formed instead of branching from a common ancestor thus contradicting the evolutionary tree of life? HOMOLOGY. Why do textbooks define homology as similarity due to common ancestry, then claim that it is evidence for common ancestry a circular argument masquerading as scientific evidence? VERTEBRATE EMBRYOS. Why do textbooks use drawings of similarities in vertebrate embryos as evidence for their common ancestry even though biologists have known for over a century that vertebrate embryos are not most similar in their early stages, and the drawings are faked? ARCHAEOPTERYX. Why do textbooks portray this fossil as the missing link between dinosaurs and modern birds even though modern birds are probably not descended from it, and its supposed ancestors do not appear until millions of years after it? PEPPERED MOTHS. Why do textbooks use pictures of peppered moths camouflaged on tree trunks as evidence for natural selection when biologists have known since the 1980s that the moths don't normally rest on tree trunks, and all the pictures have been staged? DARWIN'S FINCHES. Why do textbooks claim that beak changes in Galapagos finches during a severe drought can explain the origin of species by natural selection even though the changes were reversed after the drought ended, and no net evolution occurred? MUTANT FRUIT FLIES. Why do textbooks use fruit flies with an extra pair of wings as evidence that DNA mutations can supply raw materials for evolution even though the extra wings have no muscles and these disabled mutants cannot survive outside the laboratory? HUMAN ORIGINS. Why are artists' drawings of ape-like humans used to justify materialistic claims that we are just animals and our existence is a mere accident when fossil experts cannot even agree on who our supposed ancestors were or what they looked like? EVOLUTION A FACT? Why are we told that Darwin's theory of evolution is a scientific fact even though many of its claims are based on misrepresentations of the facts?","trebor","334676","First of all, dealing with Jonathan Wells. He is an #####. Yes, he has a PH.D. but his education was financed by Sun Yen Moon so he can 'disprove evolution'. He had a bias from the begining, and he lies. Actually, I did. You just didn't bother to read. Gosh, I wonder why you can't answer my answer. N.C.S.E. answer: Because evolutionary theory works with any model of the origin of life on Earth, how life originated is not a question about evolution. Textbooks discuss the 1953 studies because they were the first successful attempt to show how organic molecules might have been produced on the early earth. When modern scientists changed the experimental conditions to reflect better knowledge of the earths early atmosphere, they were able to produce most of the same building blocks. Origin-of-life remains a vigorous area of research. A. Fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals all are post-Cambrian. We would recognize very few of the Cambrian organisms as modern; theyre in fact at the roots of the tree of life, showing the earliest appearances of some key features of groups of animals - but not all features and not all groups. Researchers are linking these Cambrian groups using not only fossils but also data from developmental biology. A: The same anatomical structure (such as a leg or an antenna) in two species may be similar because it was inherited from a common ancestor (homology) or because of similar adaptive pressure (convergence) . Homology of structures across species is not assumed, but tested by the repeated comparison of numerous features that do or do not sort into successive clusters. Homology is used to test hypotheses of degrees of relatedness. Homology is not evidence for common ancestry: common ancestry is inferred based on many sources of information, and reinforced by the patterns of similarity and dissimilarity of anatomical structures. A: Twentieth-century and current embryological research confirms that early stages (if not the earliest) of vertebrate embryos are more similar than later ones; the more recently species shared a common ancestor, the more similar their embryological development. Thus cows and rabbits - mammals - are more similar in their embryological development than either is to alligators. Cows and antelopes are more similar in their embryology than either is to rabbits, and so on. The union of evolution and developmental biology evo-devo is one of the most rapidly growing biological fields. Faked drawings are not relied upon: there has been plenty of research in developmental biology since Haeckel (long-discredited drawings that were used in textbooks 20 years ago) and in fact, hardly any textbooks feature Haeckels drawings, as claimed. after it? A: The notion of a missing link is an out-of-date misconception about how evolution works. Archaeopteryx (and other feathered fossils) shows how a branch of reptiles gradually acquired both the unique anatomy and flying adaptations found in all modern birds. It is a transitional fossil. These fossils are not direct ancestors of modern birds but relatives, and, as everyone knows, your uncle can be younger than you! A: These pictures are illustrations used to demonstrate a point - the advantage of protective coloration to reduce the danger of predation. The pictures are not the scientific evidence used to prove the point in the first place. Compare this illustration to the well-known re-enactments of the Battle of Gettysburg. Does the fact that these re-enactments are staged prove that the battle never happened? The peppered moth photos are the same sort of illustration, not scientific evidence for natural selection. A: Textbooks present the finch data to illustrate natural selection: that populations change their physical features in response to changes in the environment. The finch studies exquisitely documented how the physical features of an organism can affect its success in reproduction and survival, and that such changes can take place more quickly than was realized. That new species did not arise within the duration of the study hardly challenges evolution! A: In the very few textbooks that discuss four-winged fruit flies, they are used as an illustration of how genes can reprogram parts of the body to produce novel structures, thus indeed providing raw material for evolution. This type of mutation produces new structures that become available for further experimentation and potential new uses. Even if not every mutation leads to a new evolutionary pathway, the flies are a vivid example of one way mutation can provide variation for natural selection to work on. A: Drawings of humans and our ancestors illustrate the general outline of human ancestry, about which there is considerable agreement, even if new discoveries continually add to the complexity of the account. The notion that such drawings are used to justify materialistic claims is not borne out by an examination of textbook treatments of human evolution. A: In the last century, some of what Darwin originally proposed has been augmented by more modern scientific understanding of inheritance (genetics), development, and other processes that affect evolution. What remains unchanged is that similarities and differences among living things on Earth over time and space display a pattern that is best explained by evolutionary theory.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","10:55 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","61"

We have a guy arguing against evolution on the basis that organisms don't form new parts, new limbs and new abilities over time. Why are we even arguing here? Evolution doesn't imply animals spontaneously growing new appendages randomly. In fact, the concept of common decent is core in the theory of evolution. Predators and prey have 2 eyes each, big deal. They don't have to have 4 eyes to demonstrate that they evolved. The fact that they have only 2 eyes and can still see behind them shows that they have developed the necessary mechanisms to evade predators and stay alive in the most efficient way. The problem with this discussion is that the point isn't whether prey have 4 eyes or not. Even if they did, it can be just as easily argued that God made them with 4 eyes and therefore there is no convincing evidence for evolution.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:29 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","63"
