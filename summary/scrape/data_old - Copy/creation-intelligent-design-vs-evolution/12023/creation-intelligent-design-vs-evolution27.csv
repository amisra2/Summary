"02-15-2010","12023",27,"Archangel","390536","Of course my example of dogs evolving into cats or vice versa was just a random example, the fact is that evolution suggests that any number of species originally evolved from other species. Specifics isn't necessary as it never happened anyway. You can't prove that one species every evolved into another at all, so the issue is moot and nothing more than your mythical religions claims.","Larni","390540","Your cats to dog example was shown to be wrong. Specifics are important and to say something 'never happened anyway' you need provide evidence that something else happened in its place. You must have missed my post to you on miacids evolving into dogs and cats. No one can prove anything outside of formal logic, so it is true that it cannot be proved (along with any other hypothesis) but the evidence can give us great confidence in maintaining one position or another. This issue is not moot because as mentioned not being able to 'prove' something is what science is all about. We never have 100% of the available information so we can never be 100% certain. Is science a religion? I don't think so. If you do; show me how it is so.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","392"
"02-15-2010","12023",27,"Larni","390505","Your point here is that NS 'works' when some system in the organism has a negative reproductive value. So if a bird has an non fatal mutation that impedes it's ability to feed (and subsequently breed) the genes will be removed from the gene pool. This is how NS works. It does not select for things. It selects against things. You point seems to be that random mutation and NS i.e. evolution, does not account for novel functionality. I hope I understand you correctly. An argument from incredulity is a logical fallacy, rather than giving credit where it is due. It means that as one can't imagine how something could work (it) cannot work. This is what you appear to be saying. IC is not a problem for evolution for two reasons. If it was true it would not prevent evolution from acting on the 'designed' system. The second reason is that IC requires a designer which must be many times more IC than the system in question. Who designed the designer? This is infinite regression of designer, each one more IC than the next. Independent RNA based life is consistent with the RNA world hypothesis I previously linked. Sophistry. Your point remains circular. It's still a figure of speech rather formal usage. This is the very definition of an argument from incredulity: a logical fallacy. All you have said here is that it obviously correct. You need to support your position with evidence. Cars have serial numbers because they are designed. You asked my how I would tell if it is designed. That's how I would know. There is no evidence of design in nature. Then you agree a designer is not required for life? Good. That is not what I meant. Under the scientific methodology one never attempts to prove a negative i.e. one attempts to falsify ones hypotheses. That's what I meant. The ToE makes no reference to abiogenesis (high school text books not withstanding). But to pick this point up, high school text book say elections are discrete particles (rather than excitation of the EM field). Some things are kept simple for kids. I don't. Nor does any scientist. It is just not relevant to the research. It is not ruled out any more than Loki is specifically ruled out. It is about as important to science as Zeus. You are in for a shock then. But taking out NS does not happen in nature. The only way you could do that would be in an experiment. What would that show us. Every replicator that has to compete for resources and replicates imperfectly has NS acting on it. Even as you read this the words I write are undergoing NS as you select the sentences that are of more interest to you. If I wrote nothing of interest you would not reply and my out put would decline. For my conversation to you to survive I would have to write (by chance) things that catch your attention. This is NS in action. Take it easy, freedom","Freedom","390581","Not when talking about a so called sicentific hypothesis, by definition one must imagine how something can work or else they would not have a rational explaination for it. If you believe my position is that of fallacy try to defeat my falling leaves and bricks theory, can you do it without doing something I am doing to evolution? What? Where did you get that? It is clear that ""it has always been"" is a an answer that would end the regression, it would be valid to say that about life.... if we didn't know it was false. They have observed life without cells have they? Because you said so huh? Then what's all the fuss about, Intelligent design is only a figure of speech. You see they only mean that the design is intelligently conceived, not that anyone actually designed it I committed a fallacy by answering your question on why scientist use certain terms?...... Take physics, I don't mean to be rude but since you are contending that my generalizations are not correct you would have to mean that more energetic systems are not more chaotic and complex crystals are not less ordered than simple crystals. How would you know a serial number is the mark of a designer? Not directly or exclusivly A hypothesis does not become true because you cannot falsify it. Again disprove my falling brick and leaf hypothesis. Been reading too much theoretical physics there. Perhaps my analogy of unified field theory was prophetical. Remember that. I am shocked; Christians seem to take it as a matter of doctrine to be against evolution. Well this won't make it any easier; they have as much faith as you All right you clearly dont understand what I'm talking about. Evolution states that mutations occur, the negative ones are eliminated the positive ones are selected for. Yes selection is not merely a negative force, if it is beneficial mutation the creature will have a higher reproductive ratio and its genes will be spread at a greater ratio. If this last was not the case neutral mutations would drown out beneficial ones like static. The key to evolution is defeating the odds, by accumulating beneficial mutations over time, natural selection being the filter. You have (and forgive me if I misunderstood) attempted to refute IC by claiming that it does not make it impossible for an IC system to form. You are correct, what it does prevent is gradual selection. That is the key of evolution which means it prevents evolution. You have said systems could already exist that would form a IC system, that is possible, what is not possible is that those systems were being selected for the functionality of the IC system. Of course natural selection never stops working, but it never works on what does not exist. If system A is IC you cannot say it was selected for over multiple mutations because IC means it does not work without all components. Similarly if a system is IC you cannot say it was formed out of components that were selected for, because that is merely moving the mutation to the preexistence of other elements. If system A can be made out of systems B and C, and systems B and C are being selected for it does not mean system A is being selected for. Explain how system A can be selected for if it is IC? Thanks, you too. Just realized something after I walked into the next room, of course the Catholic Church isn't against evolution, they don't see it as a block to ID, but atheist see ID and evolution as diametrically opposed.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","393"

You throw a bunch of organic molecules in, apply some energy and out pops something more complex than anything that was put in. Over the surface of an entire planet, this could be reasonably speculated to happen millions of times a second. Over the course of millions of years, this can happen billions and billions of times. Many self replicating molecules could have popped up during this time. The next hurdle is finding one that is stout enough to survive UV light, heat. etc. Evidence suggest that as soon as the Earth cooled enough for organic molecules to remain stable, life emerged. I may be confused here, but are you suggesting that because there was no line leading up to the first replicating molecule that evolution could not have taken over since there was no process already in place? My understanding is that once you have a surviving population of anything that are all able to pass on information to subsequent populations in an imperfect manner, evolution is inevitable.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:32 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","394"

It is chance that evolutionist rely on to defeat origin and irreducible complexity. Larni has complained about a so called argument from incredulity, just because you can't imagine these jumps not happening by droning on to yourself ""millions of years billions of interactions"" doesn't mean it happened. Exactly, it is the odds that are relied upon not natural selection. No that evolution could not have acted to put the first process in place, that pattern continues after life is formed in the examples of irreducible complexity. Natural selection and refinement are inevitable, the rest of that cultural assurance is a product of political thrust.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:45 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","396"

Where in the Bible does it say anything about any other species of human? I'm sure if you look really hard you can find some vague reference to people living in caves or something referencing some archaic, alternate definition used by some tribe of people living in some remote area of the Middle East whereby ""house"" means ""cave"" and then shoving that in my face as proof of the fact that the Bible knows all about other species of humans.

Unless of course you are talking about ""scientist"" who are merely speculate on how something could have happened and throw probability in there where natural selection does not operate and so the effect will truly be random. It is not evidence for ID Have you read my post? Separate systems are not selecting for an IC system, therefore it is non-gradual that an IC system would form from those components, just as if it were a single mutation. Evolution can operate on the components that might form a IC system but it is not selecting those components for an IC system so it is one shot random that components could form an IC system. If you have studied cellular biology you know that without the key phrase ""gradual change"" you are not looking at evolution. It would be support for ID for such an event to occur.
