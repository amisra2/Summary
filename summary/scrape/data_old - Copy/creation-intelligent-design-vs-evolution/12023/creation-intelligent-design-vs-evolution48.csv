Anyway, a single base pair that does not change an amino acid cannot be seriously selected (I say seriously because I think I did hear that even super slight selection pressures like the amount of nitrogen saved to make one kind of nucleotide over the other can manifest in huge populations). This is included though because also by definition that change is not on any linear path to sequence Y, so it is ignored like the rest of the genetic drift and unrelated selection.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","03:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","707"

The first dozen times I was actually pretty worried that I would be made a fool by some piece of evidence, but this I think is about the 50th example and I just skim through them until I find the inevitable facts that show that this occurrence is perfectly consistent with my conclusions. The inevitable fact is that the mutation is usually very small, the 'adaptation' already existed and was being reactivated or slightly modified, or most common something was deleted that broke something that was causing a weakness. Let me share with you the important parts of this article: ""It turns out the fish sport a handy modification to a gene encoding a protein known to regulate the toxic effects of PCBs and related chemicals, called the aryl hydrocarbon receptor2, or AHR2. The fish are missing six base pairs of DNA of the AHR2 gene , and the two amino acids each triplet would code for. PCBs bind poorly to the mutated receptors, apparently blunting the chemicals' effects. The adaptation occurs almost universally in Hudson River tomcod, but crops up only infrequently in two other tomcod populationsin Connecticuts Niantic River and the Shinnecock Bay at Long Islands south shore. The fact that it exists at all in those nearby populations leads the researchers to believe the Hudson Bay tomcod had the mutation at least to a low degree before the PCB onslaught. In a classic case of natural selection, the fish with the mutated genes survived."" So we actually have all three common themes, the mutation was small, it was a deletion, and the adaptation already existed. How many of these will it take to convince me that complex systems can be generated by variation plus natural selection? No amount will be sufficient because they don't show that happening. Again and again the examples are of just the kind of mutations and selections I think are proper to expect based on a rational ToE.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","02:01 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","709"

The adaptation was the deletion/modification of a protein. It is a new adaptation, a change in genome, an improvement selected by NS and an example of an organisms ability to evolve. The fish that don't have the adaptation die. The function is not present in fish without the new gene and they do not survive. The fish that have the adaptation live. It's that simple.

It if fortunate that I do not agree with your attitude that one must read every possible article or book on a subject or else I would declare you to ignorant to discuss IC","Peeling","425100","Afternoon As I recall we went over irreducible complexity some months ago. The problem was and still is that you're assuming arbitrary english language semantics legislate the mapping of genes to function. That is to say, you seem to believe if you can find a way of describing two functions such that they appear conceptually discontinuous, it implies we must expect the genes or gene combinations responsible for those functions to also be widely separated. The classic counterexample we discussed was the bacterial flagellum, wrongly classified as irreducibly complex (and thus immune to construction via cumulative selection) on the grounds that removing any of the parts prevents it functioning as a locomotor. As I'm sure I and others have pointed out before, there is a plausible sequence of intermediate, functional and thus selectable stages of development for the flagellum through the progressive co-option of genes. The fact that the intermediate functions are different is neither here nor there. Your hypothesis that we shouldn't 'expect' such intersections of function gradients is, as I said, based on nothing more than arbitrary conceptual segregation - and must in any case wilt before empirical evidence. Even if intersections of this kind are relatively unusual, it can still be the case that all life is founded upon an exploration of those that do exist.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:54 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","711"
"03-03-2011","12023",48,"Freedom","425104","That somethings looks different is not certainty that the genes that form them are different nor is it that if somethings look similar is it certain that the genes that form them are similar. I need nor make use of either of these assumptions, I merely observe that there is no logical reason (and therefore no proper assumption) that different functions ought to have similar genes. Therefore it is a fact that co-option is a random chance just as surely and for the same reasons as a mutation is, yet my opponents use it to attempt to circumvent the odds they feel exist in claiming straight unselected mutation. It is entirely a matter of comfort for them that they feel selection events make any given outcome more likely even though as I have explained to them they have merely pushed the unlikelihood to another aspect of the situation so they don't have to look at it. The bacterial flagellum as far as anyone has shown me is one of the few purely IC systems, all systems however contain an IC core. It is immune to any kind of ordered, predictable, explained construction via cumulative selection. That fact is everything, a different standard of selection necessitates a different selective direction except in the case where A = B the paths are the same, assuming such paths exist for no reason and in sufficient quantity (for all systems with a smidgen of complexity) is a work of wishful and supported thinking akin to the first religion. I did not say we cannot expect co-option I said we cannot rely on it to explain the construction of systems, just like if evolution was mutations and that's it we could not expect them to explain the construction of systems. Where is co-options 'natural selection' the concept that makes the sum non-random? Make the case, but also as I said before even if that case was made we would be looking at an explaination of the advancement of life in which it is essentially an inevitable consequence of carbon based life. The answer would then be that in this universe every advancement is a consequence of launching off previous similarly inevitable ones. It would be fundamental observation... like gravity.","Peeling","425128","Then upon what are you basing your assertion that a gene or gene complex that constitutes an IC core in the context of one conceptual function cannot, or should not be expected to be, non-IC in the context of a different conceptual function? Nor can you show any logical reason why they ought not. Remember: the almost infinite majority of conceivable mappings preserve no homologies whatsoever; you can make no statistical appeal here. What is random about the fact an excellent screwdriver makes an indifferent hammer? Or that an excellent knife makes a passable screwdriver? Or that a sharpened spoon will suffice for a knife - or a hammer for a spoon? These truths are entirely lawful. Indeed I would find it more difficult to think of an example of something with only one conceivable conceptual function. I could equally say that it is a matter of comfort for you that you have chosen to believe in the existence of this unlikelihood, and that you hold fast to it despite evidence to the contrary. For a given conceptual function. This is simply not true. Plausible, independently selectable intermediate systems have been presented. You cannot stamp your foot and say you don't think they should exist, or that appealing to them is cheating. By all means, make your case that co-option should be the exception rather than the rule - thus far you have not done so - but even if you do you only demonstrate that the flagellum is just such an exception. Which would in itself be highly significant. The existence of such paths for the flagellum is more than an assumption. They have been found. On the contrary: under evolution we should expect them to explain the construction of all extant systems, even if that is a tiny subset of all possible systems. Assuredly, most possible biological systems don't exist. Why does this alone not satisfy your demand that co-option be the exception? Why does a knife function as a screwdriver? I'm honestly not mocking you there; I get the dim sense there may well be some great and profound principle tying knives, spoons, screwdrivers, flagella and secretion systems together. I read a fascinating e-book a while ago in which someone described how, seemingly for all iterative rule-sets above a certain minimum, there existed a minority of starting conditions from which those rules would generate startling complexity.

It is the exact same situation with mutations, I cannot give a reason why a single mutation event could not form a flagellum; I don't need to to say it is unlikely. I can easily make a statistical appeal here, most sequences by far are non-functional. This not only means it is easy to damage functional sequences but it more importantly indicates large distances between functional sequences in the DNA sequence space. That is because you are thinking of applications not functions, Observe: A plane has many functions, it can carry people to both Sweden and detroit. It can bomb or spy. Or does it? A plane functions as a flying vehicle. A true example of multiple functions in a plane would be taxing around on the ground and being therefore a giant car. Now lets look at your examples. What is random about it? Nothing, these things can be used for multiple functions because what they are is essentially the same, that is equivalent to saying their DNA is the same. For a screwdriver vs a knife you would tell a blacksmith to make a flat metal object with a handle. To illustrate why advancement is an objective measurement let's assume we had a screwdriver. A screwdriver is missing something essential in a knife, a blade. Since this screwdriver is a screwdriver and would be selected based on it's function as a screwdriver why would you expect it to get sharper? What is lawful about such an expectation? Present the evidence. For a function. Who says I say they should not exist, but you cannot present them and say ""look they exist so my explaination for why must be correct"". You consider the fact that no one has disproved the idea that a flagellum could arise by random processes proof that it did so. Such is an appeal to ignorance. I have only even been interested in disproving that a non-random process (like rational evolution) explains these systems. I have made the case, but it was a different case than the one against irrational evolution. No path for the flagellum has been found in my opinion, if you think it has you can post the genetic differential and force the admission out of me. That is merely the application of databeds 'million systems' explaination which proposes it is just inevitable that a mutation forms a function. It simply does not match reality. That is an escape from the duty of explaination not an explaination. Further it is an assumption by definition unless you happen to know how many possible biological systems there are. Because it is a variant of the same shape, just like a fluke and a leg are variants of the same limb organs and bones. Why doesn't a car function as a plane? In case you didn't hear I offered to build a software simulation of evolution testing out my conclusions. I offered to do so if someone who opposed my conclusions worked with me on it so as to be satisfied it is proper. Any answer would be speculation.

No. That's a completely unjustified leap. You may as well argue that since only a small proportion of the matter in the solar system is alive, and the solar system is very big, there must be enormous distances between each living organism. This is what I was talking about when I say you keep cherry-picking whatever level of abstraction suits you. What makes the 'difference' of rolling around on the ground vs flying qualitatively different from the 'difference' between dropping bombs and carrying passengers? To drag up a rhetorical question from further down: A car cannot evolve into a plane because limitations on the preservation of functionality restrict the available evolutionary paths. A car must always be able to transport human occupants, drive on roads etc etc. It is not free to evolve ever smaller and lighter (not in blind pursuit of flight, but of some other benefit) to the point where surface area vs mass starts to make falls survivable and gliding feasible (whereupon we can imagine evolution modifying the wing-mirrors to extend gliding times and the exhaust so as to provide propulsion). But that's just it: a protein transcribed from DNA is every bit as workaday and physical as a screwdriver or a hammer. They aren't abstract 'codes' or 'words'; they physically turn chemical screws and bang on chemical nails. As an incurable DIY enthusiast I can personally assure you that if all you have to cut something with is a screwdriver, you'll make do. I've buttered toast with a screwdriver. Look at what you're saying here: No. You cannot invent an arbitrary category of 'thing' and then assert objects that fit that category are only and ever subject to selection based on that category's imagined function. That's nonsense. If a sharper blade on the screwdriver would help in any way, such a modification can be selected for. The same goes for a heavier, flatter-ended handle (helping to hammer nails in - and again I can personally vouch for the efficacy of a nice heavy screwdriver in that regard). Not at all. I appeal to the fact that a series of entirely plausible intermediate systems has been presented, explaining the gradual evolution of the flagellum through progressive co-option. Before I go digging around, are you saying 'in your opinion' because the path involves changes in function? Not at all. You have assured me you do not believe co-option to be impossible, merely rare and unlikely. Presumably very rare, although you cannot support this claim. Very well. Consider the flagellum again. If you're right, and opportunities for co-option are so rare that, out of all possible biological systems, only a tiny minority could ever be realised through co-option, the discovery of such a path for the flagellum would be hugely significant, yes? Because if nature didn't depend on co-option for the evolution of its systems, it would be impossibly unlikely that any given system would, purely through chance , present itself as amenable to gradual development.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:47 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","719"
