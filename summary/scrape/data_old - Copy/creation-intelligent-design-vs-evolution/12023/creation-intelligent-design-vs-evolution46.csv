"09-21-2010","12023",46,"Freedom","413131","Let A = A belief system. Let B = A system that you believe in. 'Believing in science' = 'A system you believe in' provided science is a system. 'does not make science a belief system.' = 'Not a belief system'. Then the first statement says A IS B and the second is B IS NOT A Unfortunately identity is commutative. (the scope here the domain of the word 'science') Do you realize how rare formal logic fallacies are? Then I regret to inform you I don't know what you meant because you used the word 'need' in a vacuum. Need for what? Indeed. Which as far as I am concerned can only be caused by three possible scenarios. 1. We are not using the same meaning for the phrase belief system, or even the word belief. 2. You are deliberately playing mind games for some alterior motive. 3. You haven't a clue what I am saying and are merely contradicting me on the premise that if I think it, it's wrong. If you were content with ignoring criticism of irrational evolution you wouldn't have signed up on a political debate forum and proceed to post in threads on the topic. That point is incorrect. Continuous or steady 'progress' from one species to another does not imply that new species will be formed along the way and certainly doesn't imply that new species will survive. Uh maybe we should complicate things for a reason. A cell membrane is not a patch of skin. From this post I am sure you are talking about a multicellular life form even though you said: ""a patch of skin on a single celled eukaryotic organism"" Now, assuming you mean multi-cellular organism you may repeat 'developed a variation' but again since this is the actual process in question it simply isn't helping the way you seem to think it is to repeatedly assert it happened. Except that this action of tracing consists of looking for similarity and telling a story. Bad form for science to be as valid as the imagination of the scientist. I could tell you a story about how flukes evolved from nose muscles, the key to these evolutionary stories is making is sound plausible which is a problem because there is no standard for actual truth in the matter because they proposed explanation does not apply and cannot be checked against the proposed occurrence. No you can identify more basic forms, that does not mean you identified a process it means your mind is conjecting that some occurrence must have happened. Please don't feel offended because this is quite normal. This is in fact exactly why so many evolutionist have thought I was in contradiction accepting common descent without accepting irrational evolution. Common descent says that creatures came from common ancestors, life has advanced so then I must accept that something is causing life to advance over generations. Yes I do, that does not specify what I must accept though, you are basically pointing out 'common descent' for organisms and conjecting that some process must have happened. Ah, here is the good stuff. Another evolutionist (I don't remember who but will look it up) tried to use the secretory system as a proposed precursor as well, as evidence he posted a link to an article discussing the similarities between them. The most interesting thing after reading that article, however; was no the similarities but the fact that the article had good reason to think that the secretory system was a decomposition of the flagellum, i.e. the secratory system evolved from the flagellum. I suspect this circular descendancy comes from that fact that similarity ~~ descent connection but that does not specify the direction so often 'scientist' simply choose which ever happens to be more convenient for their paper. If it does not function ""the same say as a flagellum"". It is not a flaggelum. You may now see the relevance of my opposition to the notion that every biological system is merely a permutation of some other system. On that premise you will be hard pressed to understand IC because you will only see one actual system in life, this blurring is objectively flawed. I have, the video you linked to surmised ken miller's argument precisely I think. Are you suggesting the cilia has any connection with a flagellum besides they do the same thing for the cell? I am not suggesting that one attempts to make things complicated but trying to simplify something beyond the level made possible by the number and the meaning of the terms will omit information and necessarily cause confusion. It does not. Again I have gone through these arguments before on this very forum, since you do not wish to read what I have argued perhaps I should give you a primer. ON TYPES OF SYSTEMS: I concluded all systems in biology are either IC or HIC HIC = hybrid irreducibly complex, meaning as system which contains both necessary parts and unnecessary but merely helpful parts. HIC is a favorite escape for arguing against IC, examples of HIC are given in which the necessary component becomes necessary, it then becomes IC. It is then asserted that since an HIC system can be converted to an IC system and IC system is not IC. The blade cuts both ways though, an IC system may be converted to an HIC system and every system has an IC core which means that all novel function is IC. ON INTERMEDIATES: I made detailed arguments from many directions on the invalidity of association any function with a specific selection pressure. This is the mistake that ken miller made in the video you posted for me, He used Behe's definition of IC which has some terms implied that should not be. Most important of these being when he says 'function' he does not mean any function he means the function of the said system. The ability to decompose a system into systems with different function does not mean the system was not IC because you in fact are not able to remove and of the parts and retain the function, merely a function. Further the ability to compose a system into simpler systems with the same function does not mean the system was never IC, it means it is HIC now. ON GUIDED MUTATION: The tool previously mentioned is a formula for identifying the concept IC is talking about. I do not wish to restate it's definition if you are not interested. I can summarize what it does, it returns a boolean value which is an absolute measure of whether a genetic change is produced by evolution or pure chance. true = guided = the result of natural selection + random mutation = rational evolution. false = unguided = luck = irrational evolutions production of novelty Using this function one can define IC in another way: An IC system is one which returns false when measuring from any previously existing genetic code to the systems minimal functional form (IC core). Since nearly axiomatic that all systems have an IC core the analysis seems silly to take to see if an IC core is IC but it will still return the correct value, it is much more useful to see if a proposed IC system is just IC or HIC. It's primary purpose however is it's extreme convenience at defining the difference between creating an IC system (novel system) and improving an existing one. At the risk of sounding arrogant Behe's book 'the edge of evolution' could be reduced to two pages of explaining this tool and would stand some improvement for the lack of puzzle fitting one would have to do. No intermediates and 'you can't remove a part without removing the function' are equivalent. The eye is a system of compound IC improvements, as opposed to the flagellum which as far as I can tell is actually IC. (or very slightly HIC).","Bennedict","413166","yea. see you dont quite understand how evolution works still. first of all, evolution is far from constant and gradual. we can see some organisms evolve in our life span whereas some organisms can stay unchanged for thousands of years. evolution is very much time based, and whether a variation comes about or not in an organism is dependant on a number of variables - which could lead to evolving really quickly or very slowly. like i said previously, it could take mere decades for a species to fully develop an upgraded feature, so Darwin's original tree of life is wrong. in the one we acknowledge now, there are much more horizontal and vertical lines, and of course certain variations will not survive, that's obvious when were talking about natural selection. i think your main argument is that a feature with one purpose cannot evolve from a feature with a different purpose. this cannot be a better example of how little you know about evolution. it is very easy to draw the evolution of the hands and arms from chimpanzee to human; a chimp will use its hands and arms to aide it in walking, whereas we use our arms and hands universally, but certainly not for walking. take the feet of the chimp and compare it to that of a human; again very easy to draw similarities, but chimps use their feet for climbing trees and hanging - even using them in the same way they use their hands. we do not - we have a different purpose for our feet. those are extremely easy examples which show that you are infact wrong in saying that one feature cannot evolve from a similar feature with a different purpose. ive explained to you already one possible way of how the stomach could have developed - through the esophogus, which has a very different function than the stomach. even the evolution from fin to limb is very well documented; one is used for swimming, one is used for walking. i read somewhere that creationists love to view features as something designed with a purpose in mind. this is not how evolutionists think. if a feature is good at doing something, it will use that feature for that purpose and therefore develop it further. if we find that our hands are not so good for walking, we wont use them for walking anymore. the bacterial syringe, although it does not have the same function as a flagellum, thus it is not a flagellum as i did not claim, IS a simpler version of the flagellum. lets look at the specifics of both. both the flagellum and the syringe have rings (M,S,C,P, and L rings). the syringe uses these rings to inject host cells with a virus whereas the flagellum uses its rings as a motor. again, the features have not been designed with a purpose in mind, they use the same features for two different purposes. about this eyespot on the skin (or membrane if you prefer), i gave the example of the euglena bacterium which is a single celled eukaryotic organism with an eyespot on it's membrane: i wont dispute you when you say that multi-celled organisms can have such eyespots, they do; but single celled organisms can have similar eyespots. why the hell arent we allowed to trace back the evolution of a feature to simpler features and use that as evidence of the evolutionary process? thats exactly the kind of thing we WOULD use as evidence in any process in which time is involved. evolution is heavily based on time, so why cant we use time to explain it happening? also, you will never hear any evolutionist talk about 'luck' as you have described them doing when outlining irrational evolution. from what you say about rational evolution (minus the guided part) is what every evolutionist thinks. so irrational evolution is...well, irrational. you can just use 'evolution' from now on. no more strawmen, please. i will ignore any response to this. we can argue about the differences between no intermediates and removing a part of a function, but that would be off topic. ive already explained to you how the eye could have evolved - and we can look at simpler forms of it (this time with similar functions) in other organisms to get an idea of the process; ie the retina evolved first via the eyespot, cornea second etc. ive also explained to you that the flagellum is not irriducibly complex, seeing as we can reduce it to other, simpler forms to get an idea of how it evolved, too.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:28 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","676"

"09-21-2010","12023",46,"Freedom","413208","So you have said. In essence that is IC. If you can give reason why this is an example of ignorance I will take no offense. I have explained to you already that this level of final purpose is not what i mean when I say function. All limbs and digits are merely different shaped versions of each other. The key to recognizing a functional domain is to avoid claiming that function that can be performed inefficiently does not accomplish the function. I can climb a tree now, if was truly a different function I would not be able to. I simply cannot do it better than a chimp. Chimps have refined climbing limbs and I have refined walking limbs. I am sorry it appears I used the '40 of 50' as a reference between eukaryotic rudimentary flagellum and this bacterial syringe. ""certain eukariotic flagellum are a more rudimentary version of the bacterial kind. they are missing sometimes up to 40 of the 50 parts of their flagellum and they are still perfectly functional."" <-> ""this is the one example i gave that is missing 40 of its 50 parts. its missing the hook, tip, junction, filament, and the parts that makes it rotate. it doesnt function the same say as a flagellum does"" It is coincidence that the number of missing parts are the same, and when you said you gave the example you meant before this thread? I am still interested in the rudimentary flagellum though. I don't actually see an argument against IC in this post. I reread it and realize I became confused. You equated skin with a membrane but then you stopped talking about the euglena and started on the macro-scopic eye right? ""to continue with the eye as you asked, this 'complex of proteins on the cell membrane' ie patch of light sensative skin... no need to complicate things for no reason... Speaking about multi-cellular eye NOW developed a variation to be concave - thus differentiation between light and dark as well as knowing the general direction of which the light source or shadow is coming from. the edges of the skin folded over the opening of the concave structure giving a very blurry image to form on these light sensative cells. liquid and a rudimentary lens formed inside and provided a much clearer image... the process continues."" I did not know the single cells could even make use of this information it gets from a light sensitive organelle. Very interesting, do you know what control systems are attached to the input? Actually I just realized there was a chloroplast inside that fellow, it probably knows to swim when there is no light right? Be my guest but this tracing gives you no insight into any evolutionary process it (as far as I can see in all examples) merely sets up decendancy connections. Could you please try to formulate the argumental link between this tracing and the process of evolution? This will help me to understand and respond to you. Databed and peeling were forced to it by my arguments and you probably will be as well if you continue to argue honestly. Uh the guided part is what differentiates it from irrational evolution. but yes I have noticed that effect, it seems most keep the idea of rational evolution in their minds while at the same time assuming the conclusion of irrational evolution. Define 'evolution' and I will use it as you define it. I disagree, as I said it appeared you asserted that all the actual advancements 'developed' by means of 'variation'. Since this is the subject matter it is equivalent to saying ""how did it happen? , by the process of it happening"". You aren't trying to answer the same questions as I then, you are looking for a time line given the premise that functions spring up by chance and that this need not be explained no matter how many proteins are required. Perhaps your finest If you think that is a pathetic comeback, that's because it is. I am not debating you; you are having some kinda of bizarre grammatical sparing match. As you have completly convinced me of this now I will be ignoring any attempt at it's continuance. I am not sure what you mean. I have not yet seen any true arguments from you yet I thought you were 'setting your pieces up' with this information of proposed IC systems. You asserted that 'tracing' disproves IC but I have not seen support for this nor do I see how it follows myself. The argument was made in the abstract and must be defeated in the abstract. This is true of all arguments even though some are very much example ridden. The first step would be (as it always is) to identify the invalid logic in the argument. You are looking for a fallacy that doesn't exist namely that IC claims that no function has a simpler form. You can disprove a rule with an exception but not an exception with an exception. Behe is to be faulted for not explaining the way he was using the word intermediate but I will define it more explicitly. It is irrelevant that any specific intermediate exists, conceptually you can see it is obvious there can always be an intermediate if you attach no further conditions to that. (even if only a partially constructed system). An intermediate as Behe uses the word is actually a range of genetic change in which n intermediates exist and have identical selection pressure direction (scale does not matter). The ratio between n and the total genetic change is relevant for the odds of spontaneous formation jumps. Nomenclature problems such as this is why I invented (and and condemned for it) a more precise and less cluttered set of terms and rules to analyze systems. Anyway though if I was being paid (moral obligations aside) to defend irrational evolution from IC I think the most promising attack angle would be a co-option tree. A co-option tree is a connection between preexisting functions not on selection pressures but the chance that the pre-exisitng structure is so similar to a novel function that a small mutation 'jumped over' to the novel one. Even then that would be an indirect attack (i.e. it attacks the conclusion that life couldn't have advanced by pure chance by minimizing that chance) (this would be an appeal to odds) As I said I didn't see any. If your argument on a flagellum for example is 'there is a bacterial syringe', of course I am not going to attack that it's a fact. I attacked the implications you claimed that fact had.","Bennedict","413224","ill start with reasons for your ignorance. saying that a feature cannot come about from a similar feature with a different purpose is simply incorrect. almost all of the features in biological systems are an evolved version of a different feature with a different function at some point or another. evolution 101 will tell you this. another thing evolution 101 can tell you is the process in which evolution works - natural selection. ill get back to that. i apologize for the confusion, i said 'certain eukaryotic flagellum'... but then started talking about the syringe missing 40 of 50 parts, but you thought i still meant a flagellum. the argument that the flagellum and syringe use the same set of rings to perform two completely different functions indicates that the syringe is a rudimentary flagellum that performs a different task. so, the flagellum could have easily evolved from the syringe, instead of providing a tool for injection of a virus, providing a mode of efficient transportation. one cell could carry many syringes on it's membrane, but if just one were to evolve into a simple cilia or flagellum, the result would be very very harmful to the host cell. selection pressure would encourage the syringe to evolve into a mechanism for movement, which, with it's rings are capable of doing. like i said, multi-cellular organisms can employ the same type of eyespot that single cellular organisms can, and with multi-celled organisms, the eyespot can become concave, but not so with single-celled. i think the euglena uses chemical reactions in its cytoplasm to provide communication between eyespot and nucleus, all of it's organelles do. its such a simple mechanism that it doesnt need an optic nerve like in a more advanced eye. it most likely knows to swim where it is light, i assume. do you mean using its energy at night time and storing it when its daytime? decendency connections? what more do you need to outline the evolutionary process? by tracing back a feature to earlier evolutionary stages we can see that selection can advance a feature - not necessarily with the same function, but advance it nonetheless. most people think of selection as predator-prey relationships, but selection doesnt necessarily mean just that. for example, lets say an organism has a basic concave eye, but no real predators. it's still able to find food better than it's cousins who have a simple eyespot. if you mean that we have intermediates but not enough of them, we should have a smooth transition from one to the other, that is incorrect. evolution is not smooth or gradual or constant. similarly, not all organisms are in the same stage of development. for example, humans are just as modern as a gobbie, but a gobbie is most likely in a much early evolutionary stage. a link between tracing and evolution is this; that comparing an organism's feature that is in an early stage of development to a different organism's feature, we can see a general progression from more basic forms (early in evolutionary stage) to a more advanced form (late in evolutionary stage) which hints to us that a process of evolution must have taken place in the later, more advanced forms of that feature. the eye is a great example; we can see the nautilis' eye which is in its earlier stages and quite basic compared to the eye of an octopus, and since the two organisms are very similar, we can conclude that the eye of the octopus evolved from a form very similar to that of the more basic nautilis eye. both nautilis and octopus are part of a classificiation of animals called mollusks, and the mollusks are interesting because within that class contains every stage of eye development. snail will have a more basic eye than the nautilis for example, so it can be concluded that the nautilis' eye developed from the more basic and thus earlier in it's developmental stage, snail eye.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","682"

That is an assertion. It is not a rudimentary flagellum, to be flagellum it would have to fit the definition of flagellum. That is an assertion. Wait why would a flagellum be harmful to a cell?

It evaluates false i.e. unguided. This should be no surprise because it's obvious natural selection cannot select for a mutation that hasn't happened yet. Consider the code GTATC Suppose GTTGC is a greatly improved function. Suppose GTAGC improves the function as well. Suppose GTTTC is not an improved function. Let's evaluate from GTATC to GTTGC GTAGC improves the function of GTATC so it is selected for, it does not matter that the alterior way was not selected for the definition only requires the existance of selected mutations on the interval. It evaluates true, guided mutation. This means that natural selection caused a definite pattern to emerge from random mutation. I would use not but genetics, it's always best to start at the fundamentals.","Bennedict","413287","the flagellum would be good for the virus, yes. the link is extremely simple. i dont need to explain it any further than i already have. tracing back a feature to more basic forms gives us a very good representation of what part of the feature evolved first ie retina evolved first in the eye. laying out a timeline of the feature's evolutionary stages is exactly what youve asked - if you understand how selection works, you should be able to see that an upgraded eye will be selected for and we can see a gradual progression. its possible that youre forgetting that not all organisms are in the same developmental stages? you dont need to give me a lesson on genetics, im a university student studying zoology which includes genetics, but anyways. im assuming GTTGC is the offspring of GTATC. are you suggesting that if the third base pair were to mutate, it would have a negative effect but if the fourth were to mutate along with it, it would have a very positive effect? if i understand your test correctly, in saying that, lets say the third base pair were to mutate by itself, it would be selected against and GTTTC would become extinct, still leaving GTATC, but if the fourth base pair were to mutate first, and then the third in the following offspring, creating GTTGC? if so, then that is nothing more than simple natural selection. this guided mutation stuff is, i think an incorrect way in which natural selection works. lets say GTATC has a bunch of offspring, which all have the different intervals which you described. GTTTC would become extinct, GTTGC would prevail over all others, GTAGC and the original parent would have a neutral to slightly positive effect. the fact that GTTGC will begin to appear more often than the others is not what you call guided mutation, its simple natural selection.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:38 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","686"

You said evolution relies on the concept of time, and you are absolutely correct, you must always consider the state of affairs at the time of proposed evolution the past and future are irrelevant, only what can produce benefit for the organism right then and there. I thought genetic drift referred the the accumulation of neutral mutations in a species. The adjective 'drift' is like drifting on the water as opposed to the directed force of a sail or motor. Yes. Perhaps but I could think of no better term. I was calling it guided selection but that doesn't make sense. The essence of the term is giving a namespace to the combined effect of natural selection + random mutation. Obviously this is the proposed mechanism of evolution but it would hardly do to use that word, especially when I am refering mostly to a test to see if the process is acting or not. The idea is that since evolution predicts a pattern in genetic change what can we use to identify exactly what patterns to expect; well the answer to that is that beneficial mutations are selected for so beneficial change is the meta pattern one would expect. How about more than a single mutation though, how about the accumulation of benefit which is as necessary to evolution as the singular selection? Can one tell what the pattern in multi-mutation (having intermediates) will be? What would you call change that is produced by evolution and change that is not (such as genetic drift)? Well I said since evolution is 'selecting' amongst various mutations (presented to it via individuals) the total change is guided by these selection events. I suppose you could say determined by instead of guided but I still think guided describes it better. I don't think so.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","06:13 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","690"
