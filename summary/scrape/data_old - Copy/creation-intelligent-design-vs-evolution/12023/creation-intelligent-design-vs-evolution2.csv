And that is, why have most every form of life on Earth never evolved a third working eye? Or just 2 sets; one in front and one in the rear? Why do all creatures no matter what species or type follow the same formula of basic construction regarding structure and tools? Fish don't have noses as mammals do, yet they can smell in their underwater environment. By it's very nature of the term random mutation, the implication is made that there are no biological limitations on the possible varieties of life that can occur. Yet from land to sea to air, all animals share these common features and design. In other words, the very mechanism of life is consistent in spite of all of the various types of life. They all compliment each other in some fashion.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","02:07 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","16"

Because they evolved from fish, land animals inherited the sense of smell. The same holds true with parts like legs and eyes. The first land animals had four legs, so shouldn't it make sense for most of their descendants to have four legs as well provided they're an effective trait? Only in very specific cases where environmental pressures require radically different conditions for life are those four legs done away with (snakes, whales, dolphins). Your use of the word ""formula"" is a creative and clever bit of rhetoric, but it's misleading and not relevant. Common decent predicts exactly what you describe. Tetrapods all come from the same common ancestor, so they all have similar traits. Of course, the farther down the evolutionary tree you go, the fewer resemblances you find. I humbly submit to you that an eyeless, however-manly-legged shrimp is actually not the same as an air-breathing, milk-producing, hair-growing, spine-having, four-legged, two-eyed dog.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","02:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"

As for the ""proof"" you want, if you were genuinely interested, it's readily available. But, as I already stated, what you meant to title this thread was ""There is absolutely no evidence of the theory of evolution that would convince me"", so why should anyone waste their time teaching you high school biology, when we all know that no matter what anyone says, you'll just dismiss it and insult them?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","06:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","21"

You can say what ever you like but untill you can substantiate your claims you are jsut making noise.

Unfortunately I can't link with less than 10 post but: www bumblebee.org/invertebrates/Araneae1.htm","Archangel","334498","If I'm seeing the right photo, these eyes are in no way in the rear of the head. Although they do serve lateral vision because the insect has no neck and therefore is unable to turn its head. It must turn its whole body in order to advance its line of vision. So by what evidence do you claim this is the result of evolution and not original creation? Had the spider been at such a defensive loss prior to allegedly evolving the median eyes, how did it originally survive the millions of years needed to adapt? Especially in the radically environmentally unfriendly period in evolutionary history when this evolution process would have occurred? And why hasn't it continued to evolve more sophisticated vision in the hundreds of millions of years since then? All of these questions demand a rational answer before Creationism can be discounted out of hand.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:14 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","27"
