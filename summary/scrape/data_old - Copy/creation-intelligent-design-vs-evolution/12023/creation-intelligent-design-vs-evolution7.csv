You claimed:""have never shown to add any new structure or even a new part to any existing structure."" Now you are changing your argument away from structure as new proteins and especially enzymes (which are proteins) don't count.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","95"

Now you are changing your argument away from structure as new proteins and especially enzymes (which are proteins) don't count.","supersport","335165","first of all, the claim is that random changes in molecules do not produce bodiliy structures. Proteins are molecules and are thus not what I was referring to. Second, there are no new enzymes or new proteins produced by any mutations...and not only that but none of those mutations have been shown to be random. So for all the billions of bodily structures in the world, ToE cannot account for even ONE of them.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","96"
"12-02-2008","12023",7,"CashBurnRate","335154","Are you saying that the theory that all life evolved from a common ancestor is discarded? Why do I even bother explaining things to you. I mean, seriously. Seriously. evolution =/= theory of evolution learn to read kthx","obvious_child","335166","Where in the Theory of Evolution does it say that all life evolved from a Common Ancestor. Find me a respectable textbook that says that. Biology by Neil A. Campbell and Jane B. Reece, which is used at most colleges doesn't say that. lol. Nothing but insults. Interesting given that you can't define either properly.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:06 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","97"

Except that proteins are in fact structures and play a huge role in organisms. To deny them as relevant is to essentially say that your body isn't important. Without proteins and their functions, life cannot exist. Incorrect. I provided two links showing that claim you regularly spammed as false. How many times have you been refuted on that? 10? 15? 20? 100?","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","98"
"12-02-2008","12023",7,"obvious_child","335167","Incorrect. I provided two links showing that claim you regularly spammed as false.","supersport","335169","so of all the animal kingdom, the evidence that mutations can create new sturcutures has been narrowed down to two proteins. I deny that these were caused by mutations...show me the reference.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:13 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","99"
"12-02-2008","12023",7,"CashBurnRate","335161","You pointed out someone that had 6 fingers. I said that making a copy is not creating anything new, I never mentioned anything about reproduction. Are you incapable of reading or are you simply being dense on purpose?","SickDelirium","335171","Firstly, you didn't clearly indicate the copying you were referring to. Secondly, congratulations on being the first to use an ad hominem attack. You only denigrate your own credibility. Thirdly, your requirement that a new attachment to a limb must have a different function than the rest is arbitrary. You asked for proof of a new appendage, and I provided one. Fourthly, I've already stated that new appendages is not the only outcome of genetic variance and therefor the lack of a new appendage does not disprove it. In the overall argument of ToE vs Creationism, the issue of appendages is not relevant.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","100"

Documentation of mutations producing new features includes the following: the ability of a bacterium to digest nylon (Negoro et al. 1994; Thomas n.d.; Thwaites 1985); adaptation in yeast to a low-phosphate environment (Francis and Hansche 1972; 1973; Hansche 1975); the ability of E. coli to hydrolyze galactosylarabinose (Hall 1981; Hall and Zuzel 1980); evolution of multicellularity in a unicellular green alga (Boraas 1983; Boraas et al. 1998); modification of E. coli's fucose pathway to metabolize propanediol (Lin and Wu 1984); evolution in Klebsiella bacteria of a new metabolic pathway for metabolizing 5-carbon sugars (Hartley 1984); The nylon bug is actually 140 mutations (how could those arise randomly?) and uses a pre-existing enzyme....nothing new.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","102"
"12-02-2008","12023",7,"CashBurnRate","335159","Another lie Forming something complex =/= increasing capacity and adaption no one ever said that nothing has changed","obvious_child","335174","lol. How is taking two simple structures and modifying them into something more complex not increasing complexity? Calling me a liar and saying I've lied without any argument or proof is rather silly. Except when it allows an organism to adapt and thrive, especially by increasing available foods. In the context of evolution your link did.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","103"

None of those had any goal. All they were was experiments to see what would happen if something got added. Please look up engineering. And look at the links at the bottom of the page. They are the blue things.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","104"
