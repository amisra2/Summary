However, you are wrong, I am correct","Another opinion","392132","I can understand the dilemma since popular useage of a word is the one that most stirs the emotions. If an official use of a word contradicts the popular use, then it can easily lead to misunderstandings - which seems to be the case here. So, let me be very specific: Do you or do you not accept that various philosophers have used the term ""atheist"" to also mean those that deny the existance of the supernatural, but without certainty (as agnostics do)? That point is clearly discussed in the Wikipedia article so I would not understand the logic of denying that. However, I can understand if you do not care about how philosophers use it since it contradicts popular use. Iangb is clearly using the term in the way that philosophers use it, not in its popular use - thus the misunderstanding.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:45 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","556"

You just lumped it all under a much broader category than what the experimental and observed data suggests. I doubt you even understand the ERV mapping or you would not have made that comment. You are really slipping here. All you have done so far is say that I am wrong. You have offered not even a speck of substance in your rebuttal. If you aren't going to address the actual issues I have presented then just stop commenting. how common descent does not necessarily mean evolution. I am going to ignore the rest of your reply to keep you from coming back with feigned content.","Freedom","392135","Then why have you run out of attempted rebuttals? so... you say I am wrong, yea I don't think this is going anywhere useful. You either know that's not true and are lying or you are ignorant of it in which case it is unlikely that repeating myself would help. How does it? Common descent only means common descent, it neccesarily means increasing complexity and advancement in genes through time inherited. If that is evolution, why can't the theory explain that advancement? It's an unexplained observation. Evolution in the sense you speak of is best described as an extrapolation, given common descent, mutation, and natural selection we can probably conclude that all life evolved from simple forms. You cannot yet add ""but we have an idea as to how that would happen"" and so consequently you cannot call it a scientific theory and you cannot teach it as fact. Heliocentrism is a good analogy because it's a hypothesis that matches observed data but does not explain itself that is how you know it is not scientific fact. What good is a theory that says that the light we see comes from the sun if it does not propose that light is a ray that can travel through space from the sun to earth? What good is a theory that says life advanced from the simplest cell if it does not propose the mechanism of such advancement? If I did that to you, you would be furious at me.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:51 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","557"

I have posted the definitions of athiest and agnostic in previous posts and my objections to the use of athiest agnostic and vice versa. We are all philosophers. I accept that Accipiter and iangb can call themselves what they want..but they are agnostic. I can call myself a black man because I am whiter than an albino but if I did I would not be a black man I would be a *****","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:52 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","558"
"02-23-2010","12023",38,"iangb","392130","You haven't 'explained', you have repeated a single, incomplete definition while steadfastly ignoring all the other ones that vindicate me. To quote myself from earlier; do you deny the following - ""Atheism: The lack of belief in a God"" and ""Atheist: someone who is not theistic""?. If you do, you are denying dictionary sources without any stated reason (see the cite notes linked to a while ago). If you do not, then I fall under the 'atheist' definition.","Another opinion","392138","I understand that, in the official / philosophical use of the term ""atheist"", which is a more broadly defined term, you could indeed call yourself an agnostic atheist and even call a newborn an atheist. However, do you understand the basic point that the popular use of the term ""atheist"" does not match this broad philosophical use of that term so that, if you use the broader term, it can lead to misunderstandings - as it has here. The main goal of communication is for the other person to understand your meaning. That is far more easily accomplished if one sticks to popular useage of terms.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","559"

If you do not answer that question, then it is clear that you are not answering it because you know that the answer is that philosophers do indeed use the term to also denote agnostics. You simply do not want to admit it. However, as I have written to iangb, I tend to think that, in communicating ideas, it is usually best for people to stick to popular definitions, not more obscure philosophical ones. It leads to less misunderstanding. You are clearly using the popular use of the word ""atheist"", which is the understanding of the word that I would think the great majority of people have.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","560"

I also stick by my point that we are all philosophers .","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","06:03 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","561"
"02-23-2010","12023",38,"iangb","392144","Personally speaking, I experience the 'philosophical' usage of the term far more than the 'usual' term - not just on forums, but in day-to-day life. That could be a commentary about who my friends are or a commentary that different areas have different 'norms'. I do understand that there is the potential for misunderstanding here, which is why I've linked to as many definitions and references as possible and constantly emphasised 'broadly' - but I don't think gansao realises even that.","gansao","392146","I realise it. I have chosen a definition that was adequate and stuck with it, I dont think that you realise it The only reason to broaden the definition was to make you feel good","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","06:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","564"
"02-23-2010","12023",38,"iangb","392150","When the term is misused in order to insult someone - yes, it's worth the trouble, for the same reason I would challenge anyone who uses 'gay' as a slang insult. It's probably also because I've been following a similar debate over in the DP forums; did you see it? So answer the earlier question for me. Is there a difference between an agnostic who believes in God and an agnostic who doesn't believe in God? 'Scepticism' does not imply a lack of belief, only that the belief (or absence) is not beyond question. You have not chosen a definition, you have chosen to reject all the others. It was nice of those dictionary-writers to come up with a definition just to make me feel good...","gansao","392152","Someone who believes in god is not agnostic, someone who believes god does not exist is not agnostic read the definition of agnostic I supplied. Dictionary writers did not come up with a definition just to make you feel good. I chose a definition , you chose to reject my definition and redifine yourself as something you are not.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","06:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","566"
"02-23-2010","12023",38,"iangb","392154","But, as has been pointed out, your supplied definition of agnostic was incomplete. Agreed. On what basis do you think that dictionary writers do come up with definitions? No - you chose part of a definition. I chose to add to it with other cited definitions and this led to our disagreement. In your opinion, I am not an atheist. But your opinion disagrees with a complete definition of the term 'atheist'.","gansao","392156","My supplied definition was fine. To define words I chose a complete definition..the disagreement is all on your side. I just keep repeated the true definition in the hope it will sink in. You are not an atheist because your beliefs define you as an agnostic","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","06:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","568"
"02-23-2010","12023",38,"Another opinion","392145","and iangb is wrong in setting up this situation of misunderstandings by pushing obscure philosophical useage of the term on a population of laypeople who are only used to the popular useage of the term - a term that is so emotionally laden. ... Someone who believes in god is not agnostic","Symbiote","392164","I just wanted to point out that outside of the united states, at least in Australia, the popular usage of the term ""atheist"" IS the ""obscure"" philosophical usage. In Australia, agnostic atheists will generally simply refer to themselves as atheists, unless perhaps they're in the company of christians they are trying not to offend. If you asked any of these self-professed atheists if they were certain about the non-existence of god, they'd probably think you were an XXXXX. The idea of some kind of fundamentalist atheism that claims with certainty the absence of god is an idea simply ridiculous to most atheists. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnostic_theism","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","08:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","570"
