The only place such large scale events can be witnessed is in the fossil record where you can observe the changes that take place in the course of millions of years.. But you want people to witness such things in real time.","CashBurnRate","339213","Technically, that's not raising the bar, that's unrealistic expectation nevertheless, fruit flies only live for about a day, we can observe tens of thousands of generations, expose them to radioactivity and the environment which accelerates mutation furthermore, you can list the steps in which a mutation of a body part will happen, and then show each of those steps in different populations","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:17 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","228"

Strains of laboratory fruit flies ( Drosophila melanogaster ) have speciated several times. The original strains were obtained from wild flies in the central valley in California. They have been bred commercially for many years and it has been found that they will no longer breed back to the original wild population. It is also impossible to cross several of the strains, while others may breed but produce sterile offspring. That's what is known as allopatric speciation in the business.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","05:47 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","230"
"01-06-2009","12023",16,"Ignatius","339224","Thanks. I wonder how many news we get from the media, and assume they are correct... and they're not.","Matthew","339231","Well, they may have been only partially incorrect. Things are complicated. I mean, the reason why the issue of teaching creationism makes the news at all is that there are people trying to make it happen, even though they haven't succeeded yet (and aren't likely ever to reverse that trend). And they try loudly , which makes them seem much more widespread than they are. The two biggest cases recently have been in the state of Kansas and in the town of Dover, Pennsylvania. In neither case did creationism actually get taught, and in neither case did evolution get removed from the curriculum. In Kansas, the state school board removed naturalistic methodological constraints from its definition of science, so that supernatural explanations could be taught alongside natural ones. To my knowledge, this never actually happened in a classroom, however. In addition, the offending board members were subsequently voted out and the definition changed back. On the other hand, the new board members themselves were subsequently voted out in turn. I have no idea where things stand right now, but I don't think it looks too good for the creationists. This is mainly because of how things turned out in Dover. There, the local school board tried to force science teachers to read a statement saying that ""evolution is just a theory"" and encouraging students to investigate the supposedly non-religious idea of ""Intelligent Design."" To make a long story short, not only is ID bad science and entirely religious (and perhaps even bad theology as well), several of the board members were caught in flagrant lies pertaining to the case. (It was quite absurd: they'd say ""I never said x,"" and then the lawyers would play video of them saying x.) The judge decided against the IDists, describing the entire matter as ""breathtaking inanity."" So the upshot is, creationism has been defeated again. Biology classes teach biology, not religion.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","07:24 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","232"

You know you can get banned if you don't restrict your discussion to ridiculous strawmen of theories that bear no resemblance to the actual issue. Cease and desist with the correct definition and accurate discussion of evolution. Evolution is new body parts and nothing else! lol.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","10:21 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","233"

It wasn't video that enraged the judge enough to make him exercise his prerogative to directly question a witness, it was previous testimony by two witnesses in sworn depositions. My son, an attorney, tells me that this action by the judge is actually quite unusual. The witnesses were school board members William Buckingham and Alan Bonsell whose testimony at trial differed from their previous sworn depositions. There were two issues. One was the source of $850 used to purchase the creationist text book, Of Pandas and People for the school library. In his deposition, Bonsell stated that his father had ""donated"" the books. At trial it was revealed that the money was collected by Buckingham in his church, given to Bonsell, who then gave it to his father to buy the books. In his deposition, Buckingham denied that he had any knowledge of the source of the money used to purchase the books. There was also the issue of whether IDCreationism is scientific. In his deposition, Buckingham had admitted that his support of IDCreationism was religiously motivated. At trial he specifically denied that. Wikipedia has a short piece on the Allegations of Perjury in their article on Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","12:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","237"
