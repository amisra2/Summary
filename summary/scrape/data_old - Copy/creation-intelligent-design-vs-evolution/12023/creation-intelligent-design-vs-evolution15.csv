It's true, but what is most interesting about it is how it was buried. In 1976, workers from the Dicalite division of Grefco inc. found the remains of a baleen whale entombed vertically in a diatomaceous earth quarry. ""They've found fossils there before; in fact the machinery operators have learned a good deal about them and carefully annotate any they find with the name of the collector, the date, and the exact place found. Each discovery is turned over to Lawrence G. Barnes at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. The Whale, however, is one of the largest fossils ever collected anywhere... (It) is standing on end.. and is being exposed gradually as the diatomite is mined. Only the head and a small part of the body are visible as yet. ""The modern baleen whale is 80 to 90 feet long and has a head of similar size, indicating that the fossil may be close to 80 feet long. 46,47 Do you agree that a fossil lying parallel to the sedimentary layer in which it is found is not a polystrate fossil? I have no problem agreeing with that as a factual statement. But that isn't what the evidence states according to my source. It's only your pro-evolution source which states that and I have no reason to believe your version over my own. it just says the fossil was 'vertical', and lets you assume from that statement that it crossed horizontal strata. Go back and read it again - I'm right, aren't I? No; it clearly say's the whale is standing vertical in diatomite. It isn't making vague implications and leaving anything to the imagination. And only you could dishonestly imply that a body lying at fifty degree angle is resting in parallel position. Assuming it was at 50 degrees, couldn't an 80 to 90 foot object encompass 2, 3 or more quickly laid strata over a 40 day and night period which this flood occurred in?","Peeling","338989","Ok, let's go back and look at exactly what your source has to say about the whale: Would you agree that is the sum total of what your source has to say on the subject? Ok. Now, I would like you to point out where in the above text it says the fossil was polystrate. It doesn't, does it? It just describes it as 'vertical' - which is a bit of a stretch, but 50 degrees is indeed more vertical than horizontal. It says nothing about the angle of the sedimentary layer in which the fossil lies. Perhaps you don't appreciate why that omission is of such vital significance. Here's why: Sedimentary layers are (more or less) horizontal at the time they are deposited. Any distortion, bending or folding etc occurs afterward. The whale fossil is parallel to the layer in which it is buried, which means that at the time it was buried it was lying horizontal, and was subsequently tilted, along with the diatomite, through geological movement. The whale fossil was not polystrate, and your source doesn't claim it was. So why is it, do you suppose, you are so utterly convinced that your source disagrees with me? The answer is very simple: the above text is located almost immediately below a discussion of polystrate trees. The intention is obvious: talk about polystrate trees, then segue on to a 'vertical' whale fossil, highlighting the fact that its angle of burial is what's 'interesting' about it, and your readers won't notice the fact that you've stopped explicitly claiming the fossil was polystrate. Instead, they'll do exactly what you did, AA: you imagined that sedimentary layers are always horizontal and that a 'vertical' whale fossil would have to cross them. Here you are, in subsequent posts, arguing for something your own source never claimed: Except it clearly is, because you go on to argue: See? You're passionately defending something your source never once claimed to be true. And you're doing it because your source behaved dishonestly, mentioning a 'vertical' whale fossil right below a discussion of polystrate trees without mentioning that the whale fossil wasn't polystrate. This is why I say many creationist sources are dishonest, AA: because I can clearly see the effects of that dishonesty upon their readers. You are now utterly - and seemingly irrevocably - committed to believing that whale fossil crossed several strata, something even your source clearly knows is factually untrue. It makes me incredibly angry and sad to see you treated like this in the name of 'righteousness'.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","06:50 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","215"

Here's the link I posted: Scientific Evidence for a Worldwide Flood And the paragraphs immediately above and below the quote you posted. Extensive Strata and Pancake Layering: As we observe sedimentary strata throughout the world we see almost everywhere flat-lying (or ""pancake"") layered strata. Many of these layers are so extensive that they cover several states. Evolutionists believe that such layers were deposited slowly over millions and millions of years, or that they are simply ""river"" deposits or river deltas. 42,43 Creationists, and a growing number of geologists see problems with such interpretations. 44,45 First because there is virtually no evidence of erosion between the layers, and second, because the sheer size and extent of the strata suggests that the layers were neither formed by rivers, or river deltas. That's because many of the ""layers"" are quite thick, and cover (literally) hundreds and even thousands of square miles, and in many instances are the size of the state of Utah, or even larger. This, coupled with the presence of marine fossils that are buried in many of the layers, tells us that they were deposited by ocean currents (i.e. from a major, major Flood), like nothing we have ever seen before. We can say for certain that it was the ocean (as opposed to a lake) because of the marine fossils that are buried in much of this strata. For example, in the Grand Canyon area itself, old Earth geologists have said that the Ocean swept over the whole area on six different occasions. Young Earth geologists say it was probably only once. A ""Whale"" of a Fossil: Or should we say ""a fossil of a whale? It's true, but what is most interesting about it is how it was buried. In 1976, workers from the Dicalite division of Grefco inc. found the remains of a baleen whale entombed vertically in a diatomaceous earth quarry. ""They've found fossils there before; in fact the machinery operators have learned a good deal about them and carefully annotate any they find with the name of the collector, the date, and the exact place found.

""The modern baleen whale is 80 to 90 feet long and has a head of similar size, indicating that the fossil may be close to 80 feet long. 46,47 More Fossil Whales: ""In bogs covering glacial deposits in Michigan, skeletons of two whales were discovered ... How did they come to Michigan in the post-glacial epoch? Glaciers do not carry whales, and the ice sheet would not have brought them to the middle of a continent... Was there a sea in Michigan after the glacial epoch, only a few thousand years ago?"" 48 ""Bones of Whale have been found 440 feet above sea level, north of Lake Ontario; a skeleton of another whale was discovered in Vermont, more than 500 feet above sea level; and still another in the Montreal-Quebec area, about 600 feet above sea level..."" 48 Marine Fossils In The Mountains: In Mountains all over the world one can find sea shells and other marine fossils. These include the Sierras, the Swiss Alps, the Himalayas and many more. 49,50,51,52,53 For more on this subject see the following video 54 by Dr. Walter Brown. Frozen Mammoths: Frozen mammoths and Mammoth bones are found in large numbers in Siberia, Alaska, and Northern Europe. Some of these were in such good preservation that Eskimos would feed their dogs meat from them when they became exposed due to melting ice and snow: that is, if wolves didn't get their first. For those who want to know more see: Frozen Mammoths. Also, keep in mind that above this quoted section, polystrate strata are directly discussed. And here is a diagram regarding the same vertical whale evidence from a source that is familiar with the actual facts of this issue: here And it is nothing like your home made diagram. I agree that with any single issue raised in my link you can argue opposing views. But when all of these examples are taken together, and considering that all of these discoveries listed in that link were independently discovered by secular/non christian methods and processes. It seems ludicrous to me that we ignore what the evidence shows and disregard it out of hand since it doesn't fit with your preferred world view. It doesn't in the posted text, but it say's it above it here: Polystrate Fossils: One of the strongest pieces of evidence for a worldwide flood is the existence of what Rupke termed ""polystrate fossils."" Such fossils are found all over the world. They usually consist of fossil trees that were buried upright, and which often traverse multiple layers of strata such as sandstone, limestone, shale, and even coal beds. 1,2,3,4 They range in size from small rootlets to trees over 80 feet long. 3 Sometimes they are oblique in relation to the surrounding strata, but more often they are perpendicular to it. For example, at Joggins, Nova Scotia, polystrate tree (and root) fossils are found at various intervals throughout roughly 2,500 feet of strata. Many of these are from 10-20 feet long, 5,6 and, at least one was 40 feet long. 5,6,7 Very few of these upright fossil trees have attached roots, and only about 1 in 50 8 have both roots and rootlets attached. Such trees, and their -- more often than not -- missing roots, are discussed in much more detail in The ""Fossil Forests"" of Nova Scotia. 9 Likewise, many (if not most) of the large, fragmented, and broken-off Stigmaria roots are also missing their rootlets. 9 Many of these roots and rootlets, are also buried individually. 9 This strongly suggests that these trees did not grow in the same places where they were buried, but rather were uprooted and re-deposited there. Similar circumstances occur at various other places in Nova Scotia, as well as in the United States, England, Germany, and France. Another place where large tree stumps are preserved without their roots attached is Axel Heiberg 10,11 Island in Northern Canada. And although there is much data on buried trees in the geological literature, most of it is over 100 years old, and difficult to access. One of the few articles on this subject was by Rupke, and in it he comments that: Personally, I am of the opinion that the polystrate fossils constitute a crucial phenomenon both to the actuality and the mechanism of cataclysmic deposition. Curiously a paper on polystrate fossils appears to be a 'black swan in geological literature. Antecedent to this synopsis a systematic discussion of the relevant phenomena was never published. However, geologists must have been informed about these fossils. In view of this it seems unintelligible that uniformitarianism has kept its dominant position."" 12 With regard to Rupke's observation, I suspect the reason why such is (still) the case has more to do with one's personal bias against the concept of a Creator / God to whom we might very well have to give account than to the ever-mounting evidence against the theory of evolution and the millions of years old Earth that it requires (to appear plausible). However, T-I-M-E is simply not enough: not even BILLIONS of years of it. See also The Organic Levels of the Yellowstone Petrified Forest 13 and The Yellowstone Petrified ""Forests"" 14 by Harold Coffin. The Fossils Themselves: Fossils don't form on lake bottoms today, nor are they found forming on the bottom of the sea. 15 Instead, they normally only form when a plant or animal is buried soon after it dies. 16 Therefore, the fossils themselves are evidence of a catastrophe such as a flood or volcanic eruption that took place in the past. See also Rapid Petrification of Wood, by Andrew Snelling. Clastic Dikes: According to Austin, a clastic dike is ""a cross cutting body of sedimentary material which has been intruded into a foreign rock mass."" 17 ""These dikes...(may) penetrate horizontal sedimentary strata (or) they may occur... in igneous and metamorphic rocks. The process of formation of a clastic dike is analogous to wet sand oozing up between ones toes, but on a much larger scale."" 17 Clastic dikes present a problem to the ""mythions of years"" mindset of evolution in that massive ""older"" sediments are found intruding up into overlying younger strata. This must have occurred while the ""older"" sediments were still in a plastic state. What took these ""older"" sediments so long to become hard? One would think that a million years would be more than enough time to turn massive sand laden sediments into sandstone, yet we have an example of sediments which are said to be 80 million years older than those above them, and yet they still had not become hard, but were in a wet and plastic state when an earth movement caused them to be forced up into the (supposedly much) ""younger"" sediments. Such things not only present serious problems for the evolutionary method of ""dating"", but also tell us that something is wrong with the millions of years mindset of evolutionary theory itself, and thus cause strongly suspicion that we are not being told the truth by the mass media, nor the ""Scientific"" community of believers in evolution. 17,18,19 Mt. St. Helens: Three separate eruptions produced sedimentary-type layers hundreds of feet thick. One of these was a hurricane velocity deposit that produced thousands of thin laminations up to 25 feet thick 10,11,12 The third eruption was a lava flow, which turned into a hot mud-flow as it crossed the Toutle River. This hot mud flow not only diverted the river, but carved a 17 mile long series of canyons (up to 140 feet deep) in a matter of hours. They call it the Little Grand Canyon of the Toutle River."" 20,21,22 And to this very day, the neither the mass media, nor any popular ""science"" publications have told the public what happened. 23 For more on this see Mt. St. Helens: Evidence in Support of Biblical Catastrophe. Palouse Canyon: In Eastern Washington State there is a canyon that was eroded through solid basalt by Lake Missoula floods in 1-2 days. This canyon is 300 to 500 feet deep. See references below for more information. 24,25,26,27,28 Observations at an Australian Beach: At Greenmount Beach on the Gold Coast of Queensland, an interesting thing occurred: ""clear laminations, or layering, in the sand--formed by the separation of normal silica-sand grains and smaller, denser mineral sand-grains such as rutile which are dark in color.. The layering was present along the whole sand mass exposed."" 29 Emphasis Added ""This was produced as a result of a beach restoration project (which involved) the dredging of sand from (a) sand bar (on) the Tweed River and carrying it by ship several kilometres north to the southern Gold Coast beaches, where it was pumped ashore as a water/sand slurry through a large pipe to the beach."" 29 See also Talking About Geology / Varves. 30 Emphasis Added Spontaneous Sorting of Layers: Laboratory experiments have shown that spontaneous sorting and layering occurs with a sand, mud and clay slurry. When the mixture slows down, the sand, mud and clay will spontaneously precipitate (settle out) and form individual layers. Dr. Guy Berthault has performed a number of experiments which demonstrate this. 31,32,33 Those who wish to see for themselves, may do so by simply ordering one of the following videos : Evolution: Fact or Belief? Or Experiments in Stratification. Turbidity Currents: A turbidity current is an underwater mud flow, the discovery of which caused somewhat of a revolution in geology. As a result, many sedimentary strata layers throughout the world have been reevaluated and found to be turbidites. 34,35,36,37,38,39,40 The relevant point here is that regarding what the complete page say's, you have no right or reason to just ignore these factual discoveries which throw a massive wrench in the assumptions evolutionists make in their interpretation of this info without seriously questioning them and seeking to explain them all away with rational and reasonable answers which consistently and honestly justify the existing conflicts, if it's the objective truth that is being sought.","there-absolutely-no-convincing-evidence-theory-evolution","09:11 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","216"
