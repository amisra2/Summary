"05-28-2011","15012",3,"Atlas","430886","Or evolution could have been guided by the ID entity, if so, then the term creation would only apply loosly. You want to argue against a creationist. The basic premise is different, and you can't handle that. Lets see: Xcaliber:Your a creationist!!! I win. Person: No I'm not. Xcaliber:I don't believe anything you say, your still a creationist!! I win.","Xcaliber","430909","Then it wouldn't be Evolution now would it. Simple Fact of Life.. Intelligent Design is just an umbrella term that creationists use to mask the fact that they believe in the invisible creator. In other words, Intelligent design IS Creationism.. Can't help it if the truth hurts.. If that's how you see it, I won't argue it with you.","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","03:11 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","34"

Nice try but He was just a delusional Atheist Scientist who didn't believe in Creation . He didn't believe in intelligent design any more than I do. He merely thought that Intelligent Lifeforms came here on space ships and influenced the evolution of Already living cells. He also supported Darwinism, so he didn't exactly fit the intelligent design mold. Intelligent design is the proposition that ""certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.""It is neo-creationism, a form of creationism restated in non-religious terms.It is also a contemporary adaptation of the traditional teleological argument for the existence of God, but one that deliberately avoids specifying the nature or identity of the intelligent designer. Its leading proponentsall of whom are associated with the Discovery Institute, a politically conservative think tank believe the designer to be the Christian God Intelligent design was developed by a group of American creationists who revised their argument in the creationevolution controversy to circumvent court rulings such as the United States Supreme Court Edwards v. Aguillard ruling, which barred the teaching of ""creation science"" in public schools as breaching the separation of church and state","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","05:59 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","41"

However a Buddhist model of the universe requires a self awareness of the universe itself and a regulating system within it( karma). Karma is just as applicable to all forms of flora and fauna as it is to humans. Just that only humans can recognise it. You wouldnt know Buddhist doctrine from scribblings on a toilet door so I am not surprised you cannot imagine Buddhism accommodating ID or at least a form of it. Your problem is that your imagined god that you think others imagine makes you angry and frustrated....good","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","06:14 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","43"

They believe that questions pertaining to the origin of life are a waste of time. Taking that into consideration you would be wrong in your assertion that Buddhism could be involved in Intelligent Design. Creationism, Although not specific to the Biblical God still maintains that a higher being Created Life. Intelligent Design was created to by a group of creationists.. You are wrong, get over it. Are YOU frustrated yet?.. I hope so...","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","08:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","44"
