I first encountered Bertvan on the old Internet Infidels forum more than 10 years ago. She is the reason I stopped actually taking the time to answer creationist questions as if I were writing a technical paper - I was answering one of her questions with citations and explanations and quotations from the primary literature, etc. I wrote it first in Word, and it ended up being 7 or 8 pages or something. Bertvan replied with a one-sentence XXXX-off, claiming that I did not really answer her question. So thanks, BerthaJane - you taught me that creationists of all stripes are by and large disingenuous and not interested in having their disinformation corrected, and I see that in all the time since I last encountered you, you have not learned a thing. Lucky accidents in the thousands in the proper order? How can anyone who pretends to know about evolution write something so completely idiotic and absurd?","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","07:20 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","121"

Again, you've not changed at all in 10 years - the same sad erroneous beliefs, the same sad tendency to play victim.","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","07:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","122"
