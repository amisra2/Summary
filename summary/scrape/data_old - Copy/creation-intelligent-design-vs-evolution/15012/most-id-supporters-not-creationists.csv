ID = theory of life in which life was designed by an intelligent agent. Creationism = the superiority of religious doctrine over any theory of life. Creationist assertions fit the definition of ID but their epistemology is different. That is to say that the word ID used as opposed to creationism is meant to mean all those IDrs who are not creationist, which are IDrs who think there is a rational scientific theory as opposed to a faith based one. There is no evidence for ID, however; so all of this fuss is really about the scientific right to 'consider' ID theories.

Aguillard ruling, which barred the teaching of ""creation science"" in public schools as breaching the separation of church and state.The first significant published use of intelligent design was in Of Pandas and People, a 1989 textbook intended for high-school biology classes. It seeks to redefine science in a fundamental way that would invoke supernatural explanations, a viewpoint known as theistic science. It puts forward a number of arguments, the most prominent of which are irreducible complexity and specified complexity, in support of the existence of a designer. From the mid-1990s, intelligent design proponents were supported by the Discovery Institute which, together with its Center for Science and Culture, planned and funded the ""intelligent design movement"".They advocated inclusion of intelligent design in public school curricula, leading to the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial, where U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III ruled that intelligent design is not science, that it ""cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents"", and that the school district's promotion of it therefore violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. http://www.pamd.uscourts.gov/kitzmil...miller_342.pdf Intelligent design - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia In other words Intelligent Designers are simply put, Creationists who were upset because the Government said teaching creation was not Science so Creation was removed from school studies. A group of Creationists came up with "" intelligent design"" and tried to pass it off as science in an attempt to get "" GOD"" put back into Public Schools.

Freedom, thanks for defining creationism and ID. Let me respond to your question regarding what I said regarding my statement that in order to design nature, one must be supernatural. Perhaps I was not clear; I meant that in order to create nature, one must be supernatural. Here is my logic: Premise 1: Nature was created. Premise 2: Nature did not create itself. Conclusion: Therefore, an entity outside of Nature created Nature. I suppose that ""something outside of Nature"" is how I would define supernatural. Imagine a box. Everything inside that box is nature. Someone who believes that the box is all that exists is a naturalist. Someone who believes that there is anything outside that box is a supernaturalist.

I have long thought that this in itself is a peculiarity of mystical assertion. i.e. something that would only occur to someone if they already assumed mysticism. Let me explain. If one was defining nature why would one stop short of saying 'all that exists'? I believe the answer is that they have already setup (regardless of the self-contradiction) a differentiation in their mind between physical reality and spiritual reality. Where spiritual reality (in their minds) takes on the fuzzy definition of 'that which is real but not real'; content to maintain the reality of this set of existents by faith or a definitional maze. This has many functions for mystics but the most important one is to clearly define what needs to taken on faith and what one actually has to know because of their own senses. Lets look at it a different way, let's treat all reality with the eye of scientist. If nature or the universe is defined as all that exists, no matter what we find nor what natural laws are discovered it will be 'inside the box', the box will simply expand. If we find a God who designed the rest of the known universe but self-generated himself we could certainly categorize him as a unique part of nature but if he exists (they say he does) he is part of the universe. It is therefore premise two that establishes supernaturalism but on a connection that doesnt exist in the real world, namely that it makes any more sense if god spontaneously generated the universe from the outside than if god as part of the universe spontaneously generated the rest. We cannot escape the primary dichotomy. Either existence in some form always existed; or it spontaneously generated. It is just a jedi mind trick to think weve solved it by defining existents which have many of the laws of reality absent from them.","most-id-supporters-not-creationists","08:20 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","18"

Bertvan replied with a one-sentence XXXX-off, claiming that I did not really answer her question. So thanks, BerthaJane - you taught me that creationists of all stripes are by and large disingenuous and not interested in having their disinformation corrected, and I see that in all the time since I last encountered you, you have not learned a thing.
