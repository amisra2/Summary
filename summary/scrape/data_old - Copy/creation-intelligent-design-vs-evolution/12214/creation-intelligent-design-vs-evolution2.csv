"01-16-2009","12214",2,"Smallax","340176","The essence of the discussion is not whether the various creatures adapt to various environments. The discussion is the how. Fact 1. Every population has such high fertility that its size would increase exponentially if not constrained. Fact 2. The size of populations, except for temporary annual fluctuations, remains stable over time. Fact 3. The resources available to every species are limited. Inference 1. There is intense competition among the members of a species. Fact 4. No two individuals of a population are exactly the same. Inference 2. Individuals of a population differ from each other in the probability of survival. Fact 5. Many of the differences among the individuals of a population are, at least in part, heritable. Inference 3. Natural selection, continued over many generations, results in evolution. So far there is no mechanism for an organism to grow wings when it previously had none. So you speak out intelligently and knowingly with you best evidence yet...""Creationists of any ilk fail to understand the power of the environment in acting on genetic diversity over time."" What a joke.","pandion","340459","Well, I incorrectly assumed that anyone attempting to enter the discussion would at least have a grasp of the most fundamental principles. It is quite strange to encounter someone in this day and age who lacks any knowledge whatsoever of the mechanism of adaptation since it was explained 150 years ago. It is one of Darwin's original hypotheses, independently arrived at by Alfred Russel Wallace. Darwin called this mechanism of adaptive change natural selection. It is based on a few simple observations and inferences. Here is how Ernst Mayr, formulator of the biological species concept and one of the evolutionary biologists responsible for the modern synthesis, put it: Darwin and Wallace realized that this process operating within species would result in organisms that appeared designed for their environment. Those organisms that possessed advantageous characteristics had a survival, and thus reproductive, advantage. If the advantageous characteristics were heritable, individuals in the next generation would also possess a reproductive advantage. That is why biologists sometimes talk about natural selection as being differential reproductive success. Natural selection was seriously debated for about 50 years before Mendel's work in genetics was rediscovered. That event supplied the missing mechanism of heredity. Darwin's theories + Mendelian genetics = modern synthesis. For 150 years, Darwin's theories have passed every test that has been devised. I know this may seem obvious to most people, but it seems to have escaped the notice of creationists. Birds are tetrapods, as are amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Birds didn't just grow wings. Wings are adaptions of the front limbs that were covered with feathers. Perhaps you are unaware of the evidence that indicates that maniraptors had feathers, probably for thermoregulation. Saying that there is no mechanism for birds to grow wings when they previously had none is like saying that there is no mechanism for mankind to grow arms when he previously had none. You see, mankind's closest relatives are the two species of chimpanzee - they are quadrupeds. And you have been so kind as to prove my point. Obviously you fail to understand. I can recommend some books for you to read to educate yourself a little. Let me know. At any rate, after extensive reading of the opinions of creationists such as Mr. Kent Hovind and Ken Ham, we truthfully characterize the creationist knowledge of science when we say:","intelligent-designs-black-box","11:39 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"
"01-16-2009","12214",2,"jakers","340486","Hi; I'm back, as promised. First let me say thank-you to Marc for his gracious welcome. Others have not been so kind. I can't imagine what put ""Winston Smith"" into such a snit, since Orwell's character was much concerned with semantics, and how language is twisted and bent out of shape for ideological purposes. Since I am in complete accord with, and a great admirer of, George Orwell and his work, it's quite odd to hear to hear someone using the name of one of his heroes to champion 'truthspeak'. And to quite crudely insult me personally. Is this an unmoderated board, or are the rules of good manners held in the same low esteem here as people like mr. smith hold the rules of good English? IAC, boors are never worth further notice, once they've revealed themselves. You, however, even though irritated by my insistence upon semantic honesty, have remained a gentleman. At least thus far. I'll try to finish your post, read your response to mine, and decide whether or not it will be fun to discuss this topic further, despite the hoots and catcalls . Let me give you my own definition. Intelligence is the faculty or capacity or ability to take in data from the environment, process it into meaning and significance, i.e., information wrt to a sensed 'self', an identity, and to use that information to determine, choose, and select a course of action from among alternatives, and then to record, store, [memorize]and if called upon in future, recollect [remember, re-acquire] that for previously acquired information for present application, use. I see nothing circular in it, but a great deal that is teleological. Which means you probably will not accept it. But I am a person who likes to believe that intelligence and other mental attributes are indeed actual phenomena, and not some kind of illusory epiphenomenon caused by the way in which molecules react to one another, either mechanically or accidentally. Now, if you do choose to adopt this latter position, [one much favoured in the world of 'science', apparently], and so simply and arbitrarily deny the existence of intelligence etc. because it does not fit into your philosophy, that is fair enough. But if you also wish to continue this debate with me, then you can nether denote nor connote, state or imply, that any molecular, chemical, or organismic behaviour falls under the definition that I have just given for 'intelligence', and its cognates. If you cannot do that, then I cannot continue. Well, I have no trouble with that, because it is pure, unvarnished teleology. The ""final cause"" in Aristotle's terms. As far as I am concerned, that's ""Intelligent Design"" in a nutshell. But how you can attribute planning and invention to a combination of simple mechanics and accidents is quite beyond me. Accept your own cited definition of 'design' and you argue my side for me. First, ""mimic"" is a poor choice of words [as per my continuing objections], since it denotes conscious and deliberate imitation. Now, to me anything that is intentional is teleological. I cannot attribute conscious and deliberate imitation to inanimate objects [proteins and molecules] and/or abstract concepts--only to intelligent entities. Now if you wish to say ""it is the case that simulations of proteins at the molecular level, in which only the known natural forces are represented, accurately [mirror, reflect, or resemble] their behaviour in real organisms."" Then go ahead. Those words do not imply intention, and so are not teleological. Moreover they neither surprise nor impress me. I mean what would expect mechanical things to do? Change their behaviour according to the time of day. Mechanical things never change. They always act the same, given the same set of conditions. That's why we call them 'mechanical'. Second, why in the world would it matter to me that an intelligently designed computer simulation with the laws of chemistry and atomic physics programmed into it should accurately mirror those same principles in the 'real' world?!? What's your point? Absolutely. Indeed, it is the very issue that we are debating, so it couldn't be more pertinent. The ""how"", that is the causation of biological evolution, the mechanism/force/agency that drives it and accounts for its existence in the realworld, is exactly what we are debating. I am saying that it is 'something' that is 'intelligent' and 'designing', i.e., something intentional and willful and aware. You are supposed to be arguing the opposite--that the 'how' of evolution is simple physical mechanics combined with its opposite, pure chance. I do not remember 'that part'. But I know that I would and do disagree with it. First of, for me, as I stated at the outset, evolution is all about the development of divergent lifeforms, i.e., organisms, over at least two or more generations. Developmental processes are are part and parcel of being a lifeform, i.e., organism. There is no, 'either/or'. I don't communicate all that well with codfish and clams, either, but what has that got to do with anything at all?!?!? That doesn't make me unintelligent. More importantly, it doesn't make codfish or clams unintelligent, either. I simply don't see what you are trying to get at. There used to be a 'caveman' comic in the papers wherein one character had invented the wheel, Except that his 'wheel' was a perfectly square rock. The humour being that he didn't seem to realize that only round, circular things can function as wheels. That is all I meant by form limits function. I don't remember saying that it 'determines' function, but only that it 'regulates' it, or constrains the 'function' possibilities open to it. What Aristotle would, I think, call a 'formal cause'. Such as trying to construct a fire using sand and water. The materials do not determine a fire but they do limit the possibilities thereof. Thank heaven, or we'd all go up in smoke. It may not be unreasonable, but for me its boring. I am not interested in discussing the mechanics of molecular chemistry. I only want to discuss the evolution of life forms. Now, if you believe that organisms are nothing more than a collection of chemically interacting molecules, that's fine. But I don't. Nor do I have to simply take your word for it. Your job in this debate is to prove to me that this, your premise, is true. I am not going to allow you to 'beg the question' by accepting your premise/conclusion as a given. True. But don't put those words in my mouth. It's up to you to find an honest way to express your ideas coherently and intelligibly. Ever since Darwin biologists have anthropomorphized the process of evolution. After over 150 years of misuse the general public, particularly those who attended the right schools, may 'intuitively' accept it, but they are wrong [no fault of theirs] to do so. Evolution is a process, not the agent or agency driving that process. So appeals to popularity are unacceptable. So you say. I disagree. Semantically-speaking, that's quite the circular statement you just made, since, in semantic terms, 'defining' and 'describing accurately' mean the same thing. Semantics is the science of determining the truth relation between a word and its meaning. That is, the 'true meaning' of a given word, symbol, whatever. IOW, you intend to use teleological words illegitimately, to express non-teleological mechanics. That's too bad. I was enjoying this. True. It is called, ""intelligent design"". It is exactly what I am arguing in favour of, re evolution. So how can it not matter?!? The contrary is true. If I understand [and I'm not sure that I do] your concept, 'complex specified information', than any search process must eventually come to a ' best' solution, if any such solution exists. The trouble is, that purely randomly generated 'possible solutions' will never achieve anything unless there is some very good luck involved, or the number of possible solutions allowed for trial boil down to 'either/or', or close to it. My contention is that organisms are not presented with 'either/or solutions to the real world problem of adaptation and survival in an environment composed of much CSI. That in fact, random 'try and try and try again' just won't cut it there. Simplification of a problem does not exclude its solution unless the 'problem solver' does not recognize it before it excludes it. Anything without awareness, values, and powers of discrimination will limit the complexity by comparing the solution with the problem, and chucking the failures out, until the problem/solution ratio gets very close to either/or. But with these qualities we are talking a 'goal-directed' i.e., teleological, process of elimination, in which 'good' solutions are kept, and 'poor' solutions are discarded, as the 'search space' is simplified by this intelligence-dependent culling process. How do you propose that "" limited variations upon previous trials"" take place, other than teleologically, as above? Random chance does not limit variations, and pure mechanics does not permit variation. If you can answer this question, could you please furnish an example for clarification? All ""feedback mechanisms"" are teleological, as above. This I agree with. Sorry. I've tried to figure out what you are trying to say, ""the binary nature of success prevents that process from converging upon a solution"" but I cannot. True. And that is what teleological processes are all about. Mechanical generation/chance elimination processes have no feed-back mechanisms, because they have no awareness of what they are doing, or why. True, but teleology dependent. 'Recognizing' is integral to 'designing'. There is no designing without awareness and intent. You can recognise something you did not design, but you cannot design anything that you cannot recognise. True. But the statement is vacuous, tautological, a truism, a mere statement of fact, explaining nothing. It speaks only to outcome, not to cause, and not to process. To become meaningful you must establish a verifiable connection between the fact/result that 'Tom won the race.', and the reason/s for why and how he did so. Well if that's so, then it is not my ""ID"" theory you're talking about, since your third condition was in fact the only one I accepted. My point exactly. Couldn't have put it better myself. that's teleological problem solving, versus mechanics plus random accident [pot shots in the dark] problem solving, right there. Well, it has been a long pull, much longer than I like, but I've finished my reply. As I said, unless you stop using teleology as if it were mechanics plus chance, by using teleological language and example as if they demonstrated chemical mechanics plus random chance, then I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree. Which won't be all bad, given that some very disagreeable types have attached themselves to this thread. Been good talking to you, though. Thanks.","Winston Smith","340514","Obviously you know absolutely nothing about the theory of evolution, luck and chance are not the engines of evolution. we have mutations and those random mutation which give an organism a reproductive advantage over the rest get passed on. The physical world is the final arbiter of which mutations are advantageous or not. There is no intelligent design, and there is no plan when it comes to evolution. maybe Peeling ought to give you a primer on the theory of evolution, kinda ""Evolution for Dummies""","intelligent-designs-black-box","06:10 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","20"
"01-16-2009","12214",2,"The Barbarian","340495","I think you're right. So how about this... Let Darwinism loose in an electronics lab and just watch what it creates. A lean, mean machine that nobody understands. Clive Davidson reports ""GO!"" barks the researcher into the microphone. The oscilloscope in front of him displays a steady green line across the top of its screen. ""Stop!"" he says and the line immediately drops to the bottom. Between the microphone and the oscilloscope is an electronic circuit that discriminates between the two words. It puts out 5 volts when it hears ""go"" and cuts off the signal when it hears ""stop"". It is unremarkable that a microprocessor can perform such a task--except in this case. Even though the circuit consists of only a small number of basic components, the researcher, Adrian Thompson, does not know how it works. He can't ask the designer because there wasn't one. Instead, the circuit evolved from a ""primordial soup"" of silicon components guided by the principles of genetic variation and survival of the fittest. Apparently, the device works by some so-far-unrecognized effect that can't be nailed down to anything happening in an individual component. The researcher who set up the environment in which this solution evolved has no idea how it actually works. He doesn't recognize the solution. So who did design this rather complex gadget?","jakers","340521","Hi; It doesn't sound all that 'complex', and it is not a 'gadget', it is simply a phenomenon. Phenomena do not need to be designed; they can merely happen,-- provided no physical laws are broken. Now, if and when this phenomenon is shown to serve a purpose, to have a function, then you can start pre-supposing a 'designer' of some kind. Until then it's just an unexplained physical event, nothing more. I wonder if it can be repeated under modified arrangements?","intelligent-designs-black-box","09:52 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","21"
"01-17-2009","12214",2,"iangb","340559","Three immediate responses to this: 1. What prevents an organism from being viewed as a 'phenomenon'? A human (or any other organism, really) is only born into life with a 'purpose' if you accept religion, or if a purpose is bestowed upon them. 2. A circuit which can recognise verbal commands sounds highly useful for all sorts of purposes. With regards to the OP: it's an excellent post and made for very interesting reading. Would it be be a fair paraphrase of the final argument to say that ""The designer implied by ID advocates is an entity which must be able to predict the outcome of an emergent system, when given the initial conditions""? If this is the case, then practically the only entity matching the description would be, not a designer, but a D esigner. Yet this would be a Designer strangely limited - by the constraints of the initial possibilities, and by the constraints of the emergent process (see also, the Incompetent Design arguments). Good food for thought.","jakers","340569","True. You can choose any 'a priori' position on existence, life, humanity, you name it. If, as Materialists/Positivists do, you elect to believe that everything is ultimately purposeless, meaningless, and absurd, you have every right to do so. Yes, it does. It might even render 'the Clapper' obsolete . But until some intelligent human designer finds a useful app for it, and builds it, it remains nothing more than a curiosity. If it's me that your asking, I will speak only for myself, and no other ""ID advocate"". My answer is no. The designer need only be aware of present conditions, including its own abilities and the attributes of any encountered problem. For example, suppose that I am an angler, and one day I notice that trout are 'taking' a certain insect, but ignoring every artificial fly I cast to them. Now, is I pick up a specimen of what it is they are eating, then I can 'design' a fly to match, provided that a/I know how to tie a fishing fly, and b/ I have the materials necessary to the design and construction of this particular fly. If I did, and do, there is still no guarantee that I'll catcha fish. I may have to fiddle with my model if they are being really, really picky, and even then they may simply stop biting altogether. There's no need for me to ""know"" that one or more fish must bite my fly. I don't know what ""Incompetent Design"" arguments are.","intelligent-designs-black-box","12:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","23"
"01-17-2009","12214",2,"iangb","340591","In that case, your position falls apart. You've essentially said here that the only things which need a 'designer' are those things that are used for a purpose. To come at that conclusion from a different direction: Man has no purpose, therefore man can be viewed as a phenomenon, therefore Man does not need to be designed. I would argue that the 'purpose' of the circuit has already been fulfilled - it's purpose was to show that irreducibly complex entities can be created without the interference of an intelligent agency. Does something has to be 'useful' in order to have a purpose? Furthermore, it's not too big a mental leap to imagine the scientist going on to 'breed in' other components. Many 'useful apps' could be created in this way - for example, the 'evolved watch' that I linked to above is an example. For this analogy to be correct, you must already know the appearance of what you are trying to create - in this case, the specimen that you have just picked up. This doesn't work for ID, unless you are proposing that the designers copied life already existent. That begs the question of how the original life came about.","jakers","340619","""My"" philosophical position does not 'fall apart' simply because somebody else subscribes to a different view. That is a Materialist/Positivist argument. I am not at all a Materialist/Positivist; the very opposite, in fact. They are allowed to believe that nothing needs to be designed, including human beings, but I am not compelled to concede that their supposition is correct. Like Materialist ontology, you are allowed to assume anything you please. Such as, this phenomenon fulfills its purpose simply by existing. But, as above, I have every right to deny your assumption, and I do. First of all, whose 'purpose' are you referring to? After all , among its meanings, the word 'purpose' has two that apply in this case-a/an anticipated outcome that is intended or that guides your [or somebody's or something's] planned actions and b/ what something is used for. At present the 'circuit is used for nothing, it simply is, so that's b/ eliminated. Therefore a/ applies, or would if the 'circuit' -[that is, the strange phenomenon it displays]- hadn't been a totally unanticipated accident. But it was, so the word 'purpose' has no application wrt it. No. There are other legitimate senses/applications for the word, 'purpose', including a/, as given above. An anticipated or intended outcome need not be 'useful' in the usual sense of the word, 'useful'. For instance, you can pick a wild flower and then discard it. The acts are intentional and deliberate, but there is no way that anything 'useful' has been accomplished; not unless you stretch the meaning of the word 'useful' to include just about anything and everything that anybody ever does. And I've already told you that once an app has been found for it, the app will be intelligently designed. Yes, to some extent it is necessary to have at least a notion of what qualities the solution will need. The problem itself will provide the 'clues' as to what its solution will require. And it is not necessary to know exactly and precisely what the solution must be in every detail. As with the insect, you do not have to create a real insect--a fair facsimile will usually fill the bill. Nor do you have to examine a specimen under a microscope in order to know enough to create an artificial that 'works'. But to the extent that in order to design something, or to solve a problem, or whatever, you must have at least some idea of what the end result will be, according to the requirements built into the situation or problem itself. The better and truer the preconception, the quicker and easier to get the job done. But that does not mean that you cannot solve a problem starting with only the germ of an idea. Of course, if the problem gives you no clue to any conceivable solution, you're pretty much out of luck. You can try 'potshots in the dark' , but unless you are miraculously lucky, that approach will get you nowhere. Well, I do believe that all designers work from prior experience, their own or something they've learned from somebody else. Going to 'the original' from a base of 'the established'. I do not believe that novelty pops out of nowhere and nothing. And yes, in terms of biology, it does call up the question of how life arose on earth, with the implication that life on earth is based on something else, somewhere else. But let us leave the issue of genesis aside while we deal with the mechanism/s of evolution. Most proponents of chemical, mechanical mechanisms for evolution tend to object to connecting genesis and evolution, preferring to view them as two separate issues. I do not, but that's just me, and in a debate on evolution I have no need to bring up genesis unless forced to do so by my opponents. Thanks for the link.","intelligent-designs-black-box","05:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","25"
"01-18-2009","12214",2,"iangb","340685","It would not fall apart if this were a philosophical discussion. However, given that the argument is concerning the scientific merits of ID - and given that one needs to ascribe a metaphysical property such as 'purpose' to something in order to call it Intelligently Designed, your argument falls apart from a scientific points of view - if purely by Ockham's Razor. Surely b/ does apply - the circuit has been used for something? For the simplest of examples, it has been used as a talking point in this discussion. So if nothing changed about the app, but a purpose had been found for it, then it's status would change from 'intelligently evolved' (to coin a phrase) to 'intelligently designed'? Does this mean that if I use a rock to break open a coconut, that rock was intelligently designed? You seem to be under the impression that creation of an organism works something like the 'creature creator' in Spore , where the designer chooses the appropriate limbs and macroscopic features, and the microscopic features (how the creature actually 'works') sort themselves out. However, this isn't the case. Features of an organism are the result of an emergent process where the microscopic controls the macroscopic, not the other way around - and this is the argument of the OP - that reverse-engineering an emergent system such as this is incredibly difficult. An analogy presents itself. Imagine you have a running pinball machine, but you are not allowed to interact with it beyond choosing the initial speed of the pinball as it is shot into the mechanisms - the paddles/flippers work automatically on a timer. Your challenge - what you are assuming an intelligent designer could do - is to work out how fast to throw out the ball in order to get a specific score. While it is technically possible, actually doing it is near-impossible. All you are left with is to take 'potshots in the dark' of varying speeds and hope that you will strike it lucky. Apologies, I think you misunderstood me. By the 'original life', I do not mean the 'original human' or 'original organism-of-your-choice'. Instead, I mean the origins of the organism that humanity (or other organism) was based upon . Another analogy; you can buy plastic snowflake replicas as a form of confetti, or for decorative purposes. The plastic snowflakes are made by intelligent design based on the appearance of an actual snowflake. But someone looking at the origins of snowflakes would then ask how the actual snowflake came about - the fact that the plastic copy is a replica does not discuss the origins of the original. It's the 'did the intelligent designers evolve' argument, reformatted to be 'did the lifeforms that earthly organisms are based on evolve'.","jakers","340707","Well, so? This _is_ a philosophical discussion. No, it does not, since your self-titled ""scientific point of view"" is in fact based upon the metaphysical, 'a priori', philosophical pre-suppositions and basic ontological assumptions intrinsic to Materialism/Positivism. What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, my friend. You want the world to believe, as you do, that only world view that falls somewhere under the general heading of ""MATERIALISM"" can be called ""science"". You want the world to presuppose that only the mechanics/chance explanations of reality accepted by Materialism are 'scientific'. Well, you are entitled tothat opinion as far as your private life is concerned, but when you try to evangelize or impose that opinion on others, you best be prepared for the fact that, unlike you, that do not simply take it for granted. Simply labeling mental/psychological properties 'metaphysical' does not make them any less scientific than gravity, electro-magnetism, or any other phenomenon that can onlt be observed obliquely, via its effects upon things material, corporeal, and substantial. So unless you wish to confess that 'gravity' is a metaphysical concept [it is not] then you can stop trying to pretend that intelligence, volitition, motivation, etc., are ""merely"" metaphysical, mere ""objects of philosophy"" and ""unscientific"", I suggest that you drop this line of argumentation, because it's a loser. I have as much respect for ""Ockham's Razor"" as anyone, but per mit me to point out to you that, as was memorably put in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", ""It's not really a 'law', anyway. More like a 'guideline'."" But more to the point, what does ""Ochkams Razor"" have to do with disproving a non-materialist philosophy or disqualifying the presence of intelligence and volition in live organisms from the realm of scientific inquiry? That is not and was not the point. Simply because somebody can find a 'use' for something, thus endowing it with a telic purpose, does not mean that something had to be, perforce, intelligently designed and teleologically purposeful in its own creation. A boulder can drive in a tent peg, thus serving a telic purpose, but that bould was neither created nor generated so that, one happy day, it might get to act as a hammer. Are you following me so far? What ""app""? All you have so far is a curiosity, and unexplained phenomenon. Finding a purpose/use for it is an act of intelligent design, which has not, so far as you or I know, yet been done. I've already been over all of this in my earlier post to you, and I really do not enjoy repeating myself. I would say that where biology is concerned, you can put it either way and still be correct. See above. I had not seen your example before offering mine, [I compose my responses as I read posts, in order to save time, line by line] so it's quite amusing that they are so similar, don't you think? Well, you have me at a disadvantage because I have never seen ""Spore"", and probably never will. I have no idea what a 'creature creator' is supposed to be, except that it sounds as anthropomorphic as Dawkins' ""Blind Watchmaker"", or ""Mother Nature"", or ""The Great Flying Spaghetti Monster"" or whatever, and anthropomorphism plays no part in my view of the universe, including my explanation for the reality of the evolutionary process.evolution. If you want to anthropomorphise, then just say ""God"", or, ""the gods"", and be done with it. Yes, I'm quite sure that it isn't! Nice word, ""emergent"", but subject to much misuse. What do you think it means, when you use it? I know that that is, or was the original premise for the OP. I disagree with that premise, which is why I am here. I would say next to impossible if you start from a flawed philosophical premise. Begin with wrong basic idea in your head, and only much good luck will lead you to the right answer. First you have to know which part is the cart and which part is the horse. Here's my opinion--molecules, including genes, are the cart, not the horse. Well, it may be a wonderful analogy,-- but not to anything I envision or propose. In fact, it seems to be perfectly analogous to your model of evolution's mechanism more than anything else. That is-- A random mutagen whacks a gene, creating a molecular 'mutation', after which pre-programmed developmental 'flippers' may or may not, depending upon happy coincidence, rack up a good score [positive fitness] for you. No, I didn't misunderstand you. That is what I referred to, as well. Actually, I thought that I had made that quite clear. Obviously, but what's your point? I've never claimed otherwise. The 'plastic copy' or 'replica' is the process of biological inheritance. I never confuse 'inheritance', i.e., self-replication, conservation of form over time and generation, for creation; that is, the generation of the original forms, contrary to the mechanisms of inheritance/replication/manufacture of copies. If all we had we inheritance, we could have no evolution. So evolution, the process of creating novelty, originality, and diversity, is the direct opposite of conservative genetic inheritance. You can't have 'genes' doing both things at once, when these processes are in direct opposition to each other. Push/pull. Sorry, but I am not aware of these 'arguments', or at least, not in the form that you express them here.","intelligent-designs-black-box","12:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","27"

You are supposed to be arguing the opposite--that the 'how' of evolution is simple physical mechanics combined with its opposite, pure chance. (developmental processes evolve, not organisms) I do not remember 'that part'. But I know that I would and do disagree with it. First of, for me, as I stated at the outset, evolution is all about the development of divergent lifeforms, i.e., organisms, over at least two or more generations. Developmental processes are are part and parcel of being a lifeform, i.e., organism. There is no, 'either/or'. I don't communicate all that well with codfish and clams, either, but what has that got to do with anything at all?!?!? That doesn't make me unintelligent. More importantly, it doesn't make codfish or clams unintelligent, either. I simply don't see what you are trying to get at. That is all I meant by form limits function. I don't remember saying that it 'determines' function, but only that it 'regulates' it, or constrains the 'function' possibilities open to it. It may not be unreasonable, but for me its boring. I am not interested in discussing the mechanics of molecular chemistry. I only want to discuss the evolution of life forms. Now, if you believe that organisms are nothing more than a collection of chemically interacting molecules, that's fine. But I don't. Nor do I have to simply take your word for it. Your job in this debate is to prove to me that this, your premise, is true. I am not going to allow you to 'beg the question' by accepting your premise/conclusion as a given. (the prevalence of terms with teleological connotations in the language we're using, and the consequent difficulty of speaking upon any topic without bumping into them, has no implications for the presence or absence of teleology in the actual subject under discussion.) So you say. I disagree. Semantically-speaking, that's quite the circular statement you just made, since, in semantic terms, 'defining' and 'describing accurately' mean the same thing. Semantics is the science of determining the truth relation between a word and its meaning. That is, the 'true meaning' of a given word, symbol, whatever. IOW, you intend to use teleological words illegitimately, to express non-teleological mechanics. That's too bad. I was enjoying this. (when you design something, you cull alternative solutions in the abstract. ) True. It is called, ""intelligent design"". It is exactly what I am arguing in favour of, re evolution. So how can it not matter?!? (if the CSI possessed by a given solution is genuinely high, simplifications of the problem would be far more likely to wrongly exclude it than to find it, rendering 'design' an implausible explanation.) The contrary is true. If I understand [and I'm not sure that I do] your concept, 'complex specified information', than any search process must eventually come to a ' best' solution, if any such solution exists. My contention is that organisms are not presented with 'either/or solutions to the real world problem of adaptation and survival in an environment composed of much CSI. Simplification of a problem does not exclude its solution unless the 'problem solver' does not recognize it before it excludes it. How do you propose that "" limited variations upon previous trials"" take place, other than teleologically, as above? Random chance does not limit variations, and pure mechanics does not permit variation. If you can answer this question, could you please furnish an example for clarification? All ""feedback mechanisms"" are teleological, as above. Sorry. I've tried to figure out what you are trying to say, ""the binary nature of success prevents that process from converging upon a solution"" but I cannot. True. And that is what teleological processes are all about. Mechanical generation/chance elimination processes have no feed-back mechanisms, because they have no awareness of what they are doing, or why. 'Recognizing' is integral to 'designing'. (The best self-replicators inevitably predominate in future generations) True. But the statement is vacuous, tautological, a truism, a mere statement of fact, explaining nothing. It speaks only to outcome, not to cause, and not to process. To become meaningful you must establish a verifiable connection between the fact/result that 'Tom won the race.', and the reason/s for why and how he did so. Well if that's so, then it is not my ""ID"" theory you're talking about, since your third condition was in fact the only one I accepted. My point exactly. Couldn't have put it better myself. that's teleological problem solving, versus mechanics plus random accident [pot shots in the dark] problem solving, right there.","Peeling","340800","RE: jakers Once again, before I address the issues there are a couple of points to clarify: First, as regards my use of terms with teleological implications, as I've said I will do my best to accommodate your request for disambiguation. I am also happy to be corrected on the occasions when I slip up. All I ask in return is that such corrections are not employed in lieu of addressing the point I'm making. If you can correct my choice of words, you have clearly understood what I was trying to say - which means you can answer it. This isn't a formal debate; it's not about winning. It's about exchanging ideas and talking them through. Secondly, my use of teleological terms is deliberate when I reference intelligent design, so there is no need to correct me, or to imply that I am unwittingly strengthening your case. So... you don't employ the dictionary definition either? In any case, the definition of intelligence - incorporating teleology or otherwise - isn't relevant here. What concerns us is design - specifically, the fact that the degree to which a design process can reduce a problem depends upon the problem . This is what I was talking about in my preface: I'm not trying to argue that design isn't teleological. For the purposes of this discussion, I don't care one way or the other. It's irrelevant. Good! Gosh, I didn't expect that to be resolved so speedily. We've established that your earlier refusal to talk about the real-world behaviour of complex proteins in ateleological terms is unwarranted. Their sequence determines their physical form and thus their chemical interactions. So we return to the original question: if a given sequence is as complex and specific and isolated as ID theory would have us believe, is it reasonable to assume a design process produced it? Actually, no I'm not. What I'm talking about, here in this thread, are the demonstrable limitations of design processes. I'm discussing a flaw in ID theory. Now who's playing fast and loose with semantics? The process by which an organism grows is not itself 'an organism'. True - because you have not yet grasped what this discussion is about. I'm not trying to prove you're unintelligent. Indeed, the fact that you are intelligent is central to my argument. You are intelligent, yet some problems are demonstrably no more tractable to you than they are to evolutionary processes. You've actually quoted and responded to yourself there As I said, you haven't understood what's being discussed. I don't have to prove organisms are nothing more than chemically interacting molecules. Whatever the motive force , it is demonstrably the case that the sequence and consequent form of biological molecules such as proteins are vital to their operation. A key must fit a lock in order to turn, regardless of whether the torsional force is applied by a teleological agent or otherwise. Now, ID's reasoning is that the more CSI can be measured - the more complex the key and the more precisely-milled it must be before it will turn one iota - the less likely an evolutionary process is to have produced it. And that's true. However, their simultaneous assumption that a design process is always a plausible explanation for CSI is demonstrably false, as the WEP-key problem demonstrates. I'm sure you do, but the question is: why? Earlier, I posed a hypothetical: if I were to contrive a language absent all teleological terms and insist we employ it in our discussion, would you consider your inevitable capitulation fair and justified? Would you consider yourself proven wrong? You dodged the question without supplying an answer, but I can't imagine it would be 'yes'. Yet here you are, unrepentantly enjoying the semantic high ground and entirely prepared to declare a logical victory thence. Forgive me if I don't entirely buy your story that it stems from an altruistic concern for the English language Oh deary me, no. Historically Pi has been defined as '3', '25/8' and umpteen other values. Are any of those 'accurate descriptions' of the real value? Semantics define truth within the context of the language, but there is no necessary correspondence with truth in the real world. I can hardly believe you would acknowledge Orwell and claim otherwise in the same thread! Oh, sure - but what a word means doesn't itself have to represent real-world truth to any degree of accuracy. At one point Pi 'meant' three. That doesn't make three the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. It isn't an illegitimate use of a teleological word. I'm employing a scientific term in a teleologically agnostic context. I explained that from the outset in order to avoid confusion. This isn't confusion: this is just you being awkward Because all you care about is whether or not the process is teleological. Which is irrelevant here. What's relevant is to what degree the process can reduce a given problem. CSI is not my concept, but that of ID theorists. It supposedly measures how long 'eventually' is likely to be in the case of evolutionary processes, by assuming that at least one of the criteria necessary for convergence is lacking. Quite true - in fact, this is vital to the success of evolutionary processes. But that's the point: if the 'problem solver' were able to individually consider every solution his simplification culls, he wouldn't need the simplification, would he? He can't recognise a solution if he doesn't consider it, and he's employing the simplification because considering all solutions is impractical. According to ID theory high quantities of CSI mean that a given structure we see in nature is isolated in a vast sea of similar but useless alternatives - precisely the kind of solution most likely to be wrongly excluded by a simplification or abstraction of the problem. A 'for instance': suppose that in terms of streamlined shapes, a quirk of nature meant that a large, straight-sided box with a tiny dimple in one precise location on one side is the ultimate aerodynamically perfect shape. If the dimple is anywhere else, or if there's more than one, the effect disappears. Now, no designer could ever find that solution. He would observe various patterns and construct abstract models of the problem, all of which would quickly eliminate anything like a big square box. So if we were to actually observe that shape in nature, we would have no grounds for claiming that it could have been designed, right? Now, according to ID theory, organisms are packed full of molecular structures analogous to that dimpled box. So how can we possibly infer a design process? Genetic mutation. Genes are inherited unchanged for the most part, and the number of random changes that do occur is limited by the local levels of mutagens (eg radiation, chemicals or retroviruses). Thus each subsequent generation (or 'trial') inherently consists of variations on previous trials rather than entirely new random genomes. Incorrect. As noted further down, self-replication constitutes a feedback mechanism: the mere existence, extinction or abundance of a 'next generation' generated by a particular variant constitutes feedback from the environment. Teleology need not apply. Nothing needs to want to self-replicate; nothing needs to want to achieve some particular evolutionary goal, or be intelligently choosing a direction for the process. There is only variation, and the consequent replication (of varying levels of abundance), or failure to replicate. I'll try to explain: Given an arbitrary 128 digit binary number, another, purely random 128 digit binary number (which I'll call the 'seed' number) will, statistically speaking, have about 64 digits that match. Purely random variation of the seed (changing one random digit at a time) will cause that total to wander up and down. The higher it gets, the more likely random variation is to change a matching digit to a non-matching one. The lower it gets, the more likely the reverse is to occur. The expected number of generations for a purely random 'walk', as this is known, to reach 128 matching digits is therefore enormous. With me so far? Now imagine instead of one seed random number from which the random walk proceeds, there are two, and further imagine that the most 'successful' trial in one generation forms the basis for both trials in the next. Or, if both trials are equally successful, both are represented. If success is binary, as it is in the WEP-key problem (either yes, all digits match, or no, not all digits match) then both trials in each generation are almost certain to fail equally. So they each form the basis of one trial in the next generation, and so the two random walks continue side by side, neither of them likely to generate a fully matching sequence. They'll just meander around an equilibrium point of 64 matching digits until the heat-death of the universe. But what if success is not binary? What if 'success' is the number of matching digits? Now the process operates as a kind of ratchet. The 'best' random seed forms the basis of both the second generation trials. Now, either both random variants thereof will have one more matching digit (approx 25% chance at this stage), one will have one more and one will have one less (approx 50% chance), or both will have one less (25% chance). In all but the last case, the third generation will have more matching digits than the second. Our random walk now has a statistical bias towards more and more matching digits. But the effect of that bias is limited. When the number of matching digits reaches about 90, the odds of both subsequent trials having fewer matching digits reaches 50%, and the process reaches a new equilibrium. If the process includes three seeds, the equilibrium point becomes 101 matching digits. A fourth, and it's 107. A hundred seeds, and the equilibrium point of the process is 127 matching digits, at which point randomly hitting 128 is all but inevitable. That's why non-binary success is necessary for an evolutionary process to converge: it provides the statistical bias needed for the process to 'ratchet'. Again, you are simply incorrect in this belief. The relative rates at which variants self-replicate constitutes feedback all on its own. Awareness of a goal is redundant. But it is not design. Once again, you play fast and loose with semantics. You incorrectly described a process as 'intelligent design' in which the trials were random and only the recognition of success occurred. Again, I ask you: if 'success' is self-replication, what need is there for an intelligence to 'recognise' that success? What's the intelligence going to do, exactly? ""Ah, that mechanism self-replicated better than the others; I will therefore make it more abundant in the next generation so as to... oh. It already is more abundant. I'll just let it get on with it, then."" Well, I'm not about to get into a semantic wrangle about tautologies being vacuous. You agree that what I describe is inevitable, and that's enough. What differential reproductive rates explain is how random variations that happen to improve rather than impede self-replication in the local environment can accumulate - stack with one another - in individuals of successive generations, even though each such change may itself be a million-to-one shot. What differential reproductive rates explain is why you are wrong in your belief that the odds are too great for species to evolve undirected. My dear chap, it can hardly be my fault that you decided to enter a discussion about an ID theory that isn't yours. I really don't think that can be your point, since you still seem to believe that teleology is a magic bullet when it comes to problem-solving. I've provided two examples of comparatively simple problems where intelligence yields next to no advantage - upon what grounds do you claim that the biochemistry of living organisms is any different?","intelligent-designs-black-box","11:03 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","28"

In fact, until such time as you express yourself clearly and legitimately I cannot possibly know what you truly intend to express, nor will I ignore that fact and proceed on the basis of a supposition, an 'educated guess', as to what you mean. I can only understand what you truly mean, and respond to what you truly mean, when you use language that agrees with what you truly mean. That has been my point all along. And it is not that difficult to express scientific concepts in terms that are mechanical, not telic. I have shown you this more than once already. All you have to do is avoid words that necessarily imply or denote awareness and intention on the part of the subject, whenever/wherever that subject is not a living or sentient entity. Like the man says, ""It's not rocket science!"" No, it's not about 'winning', but we cannot exchange ideas unless and until those ideas are expressed in language appropriate to them. Unlike children, we cannot ascribe awareness, volition, judgement, and all the rest, to a toy soldier or plastic doll. That's what I call animism, I cannot allow you to do it with molecules, processes, genes, and the like. If you may it clear that it is the ID position, and not your own, that you are referencing, then yes, you are quite right to do so. Not if you refuse to accept the dictionary definition, but the word in question needs to be defined or all discussion comes to a grinding halt! I'm sorry, and I regret it if I offend you, but is pure nonsense. Without a mutually acceptable definition for intelligence we have absolutely no way of discussing 'intelligent',-- nor 'design', come right down to it. As above, 'design', as an active verb, always entails intelligence of some kind. That much is undeniable. Then let us proceed on the basis that 'design' is always and everywhere, teleological, i.e., 'intelligent'. Since that fact doesn't matter to you. Now all you have to do is show that complex processes that produce or serve someone's or something's purposes, that accomplish the ends of that which is external to themselves, can arise by mechanics plus chance in cases where that something is inanimate and insentient. Such as in the case of a 'gene', a 'molecule' or 'evolution', per se. I'm sorry, my faculties are not what they used to be. I often express myself poorly or simply commit mistakes. Added to which, my memory is more like a sieve than anything else. So maybe that is why I have no recollection of ever refused to allow any discussion of insentient articles, particles, or processes in _ateleological_, i.e., in mechanical terms. I do not believe that I have ever done so, but if I did, I did not mean to do so, and simply made a slip of the tongue. Can you quote the statement wherein I am supposed to have made this error, back to me? I will thank you for it. I have no real understanding of what these words mean, but so long as you do not imply that their 'sequence' is in any way 'self-aware' or 'self- intentional' or 'self-directed', but is simply and strictly an event determined by something external to themselves [such as an inflexible physical 'law'], we'll have no problem. We can discuss where and how the laws of physics arose, some other time. [quote] This is what I was afraid of. What, exactly, are you referring to when you use the word, ""sequence""?!? Are you trying to slip it into the discussion as if it were synonymous with the word 'system', or even 'process'? Because it it is not, and I will not accept it as such. This is what the noun, 'sequence' means-- noun: film consisting of a succession of related shots that develop a given subject in a movie noun: a following of one thing after another in time (""The doctor saw a sequence of patients"") noun: several repetitions of a melodic phrase in different keys noun: serial arrangement in which things follow in logical order or a recurrent pattern (""The sequence of names was alphabetical"") noun: the action of following in order (""He played the trumps in sequence"") [ I have put that which I think pertinent to your use in bold, and these are the only senses in which I will accept the usage of this noun.] And in answer to your question, anything, even random chance, can create a 'sequence' of events, when you mean nothing more than one event following after another. For and orderly, iterated, repeatable, predictable series of events, you need, at minimum, the 'laws' of physics,[even though that explanation is tautological, since that is what the laws of physics are, themselves]. Well, I guess that is why we are at cross-purposes, since it is obvious to me that whatever ""Intelligent Design Theory"" you are referring to, it is not my own understanding of intelligence and design at work in the evolutionary process. In addition, no matter to whom this theory of which you speak properly belongs, [I believe it is that of William Dembski [sp.?], whose opinions I have seldom read, and do not usually accept;-at least not as he frames them.], unless we can forget about that and concentrate on my own opinions, we will continue to fail to understand each other. Now, since I am not going to pick up Dembski's banner, you'll have to look elsewhere for an opponent, since the purpose of your thread was and is to attack his opinions, and not the concept of ""Evolution by means of Intelligent Design"", in general. Let me know if you are willing to forget about Dembski, et al, and debate my opinions on the matter.
