There is a difference between using and abusing statistics. When properly applied to scientific evidence, statistical methods can be very valuable. As I said, you're welcome to do the same for the Lamarckian ""variation is directed"" hypothesis, too. So far, the evidence indicates lack of direction rather than direction. This doesn't mean directed variation is impossible. But in the more than two centuries since Lamarck published his ideas, the evidence still has yet to turn up. Ever hear of Lysenko? More ad hominem irrelevancy. Even if politics played a role in the award, that has nothing to do with whether or not the research was good or bad. Many people would disagree with your assessment on the merits.","jakers","344188","First, let me just state that the empirical evidence that you suppose supports a '""variation in undirected"" [towards adaptation] thesis is non-existent, when you really take the trouble to a/ look for it, and to b/ examine it with anything like a critical eye.

In fact, I would say that the evidence of harmful mutations causing sick and/or crippled 'mutants' is everywhere to be found. What I do say is organisms, wherever and whenever possible, will try, and ofttimes succeed, in directing their own physiology and behaviour toward adaptation to novel environmental circumstances. This is the teleology POV. The Standard POV holds that all changes in organismic physiology and behaviour [function included] are accidental. That they begin prior to organismic need or want, thanks to a random accident taking place in an organism's genome, with the morphological/behavioural result imposed mechanically by genetic determinism upon its offspring and its offspring's offspring;--until such time as [if and when] another purely anomalous, spontaneous, accidental, random, coincidental mutation occurs that overides the first one.

Strangely, to my eyes, that evidence is everywhere to be seen. The simple fact of adaptation itself is sufficient to prompt one to lean in that direction, and from the ancient Greeks right up to the 'spontaneous random genetic mutation' model was introduced in the 1930's, everyone, including Darwin with his 'pangenesis', believed exactly that. More to the point, I researched Lysenko. Have you? First, this is not 'ad hominem'. Look it up. Second, it is fact.

I congratulate the serious participants, especially Peeling and jakers for a mature, though occasionally petty debate. The above quote rings true to my knowledge of certain organisms that appear to have adapted to dark environments. I recall learning of blind shrimp, salamanders and others that have evolved to have the remains of eyes but no real eyes...and no sense of sight. They don't need it anymore. Is this an example of that teleological adaptation (granted a reversing of sensory development rather than the manufacturing of a useful function) of which you speak?","intelligent-designs-black-box","02:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","137"
"02-16-2009","12214",10,"Matthew","344069","On the contrary, it was only by changing meanings that you could pretend that my original claim -- ""Organisms change because their genes change"" -- amounts to ""They change because they change."" Intentional or not, it's a semantic confusion of parts and wholes. Whose ""spontaneous genetic mutation model"" are you talking about? Did you get to the part of my post where I said that I don't think mutations (or any other type of genetic variation) are uncaused? Then your fight is with materialist metaphysics. Not with biology. Because the idea that the universe is ""purely material"" and ""mechanically determined"" is not entailed by the non-directedness of genetic variation. My single biggest complaint about Intelligent Design is that it confuses speculative metaphysics with empirical science. Look, I'm actually content to let bygones be bygones. Online debates get pointlessly heated all too quickly, and I don't want this not to be fun. But when you start imputing metaphysical agendas to people based on their scientific views -- metaphysical agendas that many who accept what you call the ""standard model"" of evolution simply do not hold, and that are not entailed by that model -- I'd say there's more at work here than typos! It seems to me that your argument is with metaphysical materialism and determinism. But these are not entailed by the undirectedness of variation. Perhaps this would be a fruitful opening into further discussion?","jakers","344200","The confusion is yours not mine. Your statement, ""Organisms change because their genes change."" equates gene change with organismic change, wherebye you claim that a change in a part determines any and all changes in the whole. As for my, ""they change because they change because..."", if, as you did, one adopts the determinist mechanical gene-driven hypothesis re organisms and their traits, and if, as you did, you attribute gene change to 'random mutation', i.e., spontaneous, accidental, non-mechanical, non-intentional, undirected random causes, then , in point of fact, then that is exactly what you are saying.. I am talking about that great mass of geneticists, molecular biologists, statisticians, et al, who have, ever since the late 20's and early 30's, have insisted upon coupling Darwin's ""Natural Selection"" imagery to the geneticist/statistician [see Wright, et al] supposition of genetically determined, rando, [spontaneous] and undirected evolution, which is most commonly referred to as ""Random Mutation plus Natural Selection"", often simply as ""RM+NS"". No, but, FYI, ""spontaneous does _not_ mean ""uncaused"" or ""without cause"". In fact, if you'll re-read Luria-Delbruck, you'll find [if memory serves?] that they referred to their 'mutations' as 'spontaneous'. In that sense 'spontaneous' simply means 'undirected', 'unintententional', 'random', etc. You are probably right. But we are stuck with the fact that it is biology, most specifically, evolution, that those of the Materialist/Mechanist/Positivist metaphysical persuasion have latched onto, via ""Random Genetic Mutation"", in order to convince the world at large that the universe is unintentional, a wierd accident, an act of spontaneous generation unintended, undirected, accidental, and ateleological, which not only 'could have', but in fact did, arise out of nothingness and nowhere thanks to nothing else at all giving it the least aid and support. They do this because they [rightly] fear primitive religious passions and the violence and horrors that they generate. But their motives, albeit honourable, are not scientific, but ideological, and all that they have done is deflect scientific attention away from the way evolution, and universes, operate. I did not say it was ""entailed"" by genetic determinism. Isaid that genetic determinism is part and parcel of an over-view that that the entire universe, and every event in it, are mechanically pre-determined. And the fact is, that unless you insist upon genetic determinism in evolution, not only does your ""evolution via RM+NS' hypothesis fall apart [because that would admit of something non-genetic, non-molecular, non-corporeal intervening between gene and expressed trait], the entire notion of a spontaneously self-generated universe would also crumble. And that way, materialists believe, [with unfortunately, some reason] back to horrible days of religious fundamentalism, and people dying [a la Palestine] for the sake of a children's story. The brand of ""Intelligent Design"" associated with fundamentalist right-wing politics in the USA and Canada does that, it is true. Mine does not. However, the ""RM+NS"" hypothesis is equally guilty of confusing speculative metaphysics with empirical science. Of course there is a lot more in play here than typoes and misunderstandings. But never pretend to yourself that what goes on in evolution debates is all about 'science', on either side. Only scientists bother to debate pure science. Whether you like it or not, all public debates wrt to life and evolution are philosophical debates, with 'science' merely appended to attach more or less credibility to some ideological POV, and it is that POV, not the science, that is AL:WAYS the core issue in these debates, for ALL participants, even those who pretend to be mere objective empirical 'scientists'. In the end, that is what it all comes round to, when a supposedly scientific ""theory"" depends for its very life upon an assumption of strictly genetic molecular mechanical materialist determinism. You see, we have 3 choices only,unless you can find me another. Choice 1--RM+NS, a gene is changed, ergo, mechanically, a trait is changed [genetic determinism]. Choice 2--A trait's change begins with the accidental, random, spontaneous mutation of a molecule called a gene, but it is not determined by that mutation, because along the way from 'gene' to 'trait', all sorts of other accidental, spontaneous, random, undirected aberrations take place, too, so that in fact all traits are spontaneous and random, both to their genes and the expressed traits, which are only coincidentally adaptive to specified environmental demands and opportunities. Choice 3 The organism attempts, when necessary or highly advantageous, to adapt itself to environmental circumstances, and to that end operates upon itself entire, including its own genome, and records adaptive changes in its 'self' in the code of its genome. Sometimes it wins, ofttimes it loses, and in some cases, the inability to operates successfully upon itself, its physiology, behaviours, and trait functions, it dies, along with all its kind, and we have another extinction event. But sometimes it works, and we get a novel organism, a butterfly, a bat, a bobolink, or a burbot, just to name a few.","intelligent-designs-black-box","02:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","138"

That would be a manifest contradiction, so it's hardly surprising that the evidence for it is non-existent. But I do thank you for using those brackets and differentiating what I actually said from the straw man you're keen to knock around. What I said was, ""variation is undirected."" This is because variation sometimes makes organisms more adapted to their environments, but it often makes them less so, and many times has no effect at all. Variation happens, and it doesn't have an intrinsic tendency toward adaptation. That is Lamarck's hypothesis -- and there is no evidence for it. And if that's the teleology POV, it's wrong. Organisms don't try to direct their physiology and behavior toward adaptation. They try to survive, and they try to reproduce. The indirect effect of which, under a given set of genetic and environmental circumstances, can be adaptation. Or not. I've discussed the brown bear ancestors of polar bears and the Galapagos finches with reference to this issue. The stuff about the bears was speculative, but the stuff about the finches referred to the work of the Grants. And my point has been that organisms don't produce offspring that would be adaptive any more frequently than the Mendelian-molecular model of inheritance predicts they will. Nor is there any evidence that they are ""trying"" to do so. Why do you keep ignoring this? Twice now, at least. And once again, you characterize the whole process as more ""random"" than it should be, precisely because you ignore the fact that natural selection is not a random process. It's not that some random mutation comes along and overrides a previous random mutation. It's that under a given set of environmental conditions and a given sequence of environmental events, the variations that already exist in a population -- and these variations do not have to be ""mutations,"" incidentally (but I digress) -- will cause their bearers to survive and reproduce with variable degrees of success. This process -- e.g. in the Galapagos finches -- is non -random! I mean, look. If it were random, then there should have been drought survivors of all different sizes. There should have been successfully mated male survivors of all different sizes. But that's not what happened. Why do you keep ignoring this, too? It looks to me like you're fighting a straw man. And not an assumption made by evolutionary biology. Mutations do, of course, happen. They are indeed often harmful, and they are, on some level, an ""ultimate"" source of variations. But they are hardly the only source of variation, and biologists don't say so. And all that I find ""astonishing"" here is that you actually seem to believe this. A difference in "" what it takes,"" sure. Under a given set of circumstances, some features would be adaptive for an organism, while others would be maladaptive. But that does not imply an essential difference in the process that yields both adaptations and maladaptations. You seem to be saying that there must be such a difference. 'Sure we could chalk maladaptation up to material and efficient causes -- but only final causes could explain adaptation.' One sort of explanation for failure, another sort for success. And that's what I don't buy. Perhaps so, but do non-human organisms comprehend this need and try to meet it? Do they do so by planning ahead and trying to adapt themselves? Show me the evidence. Explain to me what is going on in their conscious or subconscious minds (as you mentioned in the discussion of the polar bears' ancestors). Or in ""the psyche."" (Or in Gaia, perhaps? Is that where you're coming from? Gaia theory?) I think you have bitten off much more than any human being can chew. ""It is quite simply silly to suppose that"" this is how biologist propose that evolution by natural selection works. Yet again: straw man. But what are you astonished at? Not biology. Your straw man. [QUOTE]Even were I to grant, [which I do not, but will not argue against], that by some billion to one chance fluke of nature a spontaneous/random genetic mutation did, once or twice, by incredible good luck, result in coincidentally granting an adaptive advantage to this organism or that... See? Again with the straw man. Regularities? You mean, the sort of things that STATISTICS can be used to describe? Come on. And I'm still not sure why you think the ""standard model"" of evolution is special pleading. Living things work differently from non-living things. You yourself have said as much. Sounds like all of intelligent design to me! What about using them to describe -- how did you put it? -- ""observable regularities?"" Only if you mistake the map for the terrain, which biologists don't, so far as I can see. But not to prompt one correctly . As you yourself have said, appearances can deceive. And this is a case in point. ""Researched?"" I wouldn't put it that way, no. But it doesn't take much ""research"" to realize that his theories about environmentally induced variation failed, miserably. It is always ad hominem to invoke features of the messenger -- including not only his character but also, as is unfortunately less frequently acknowledged, his motives -- in order to discredit the message. Every time you critique evolutionary biology by talking about metaphysical agendas or politicking in their name, you're guilty of ad hominem attack. ""Look it up."" Perhaps so! But if so, a fact that is completely irrelevant to whether the science in question was good science. It's not based upon ideological differences. It's based on scientists' estimate of what is or is not quality science. If that offends anybody's politics, so what. Who was appealing to popularity? I was merely saying that a whole lot of people disagree with your assessment of the merits of the research in question. My point was that the disagreement will not be settled by accusations of politicking.","intelligent-designs-black-box","08:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","139"

That is your straw man (mis)interpretation of my claim. I hate to break this to you, but there is a relationship between genetic change and phenotypic change. To say this does not commit one to the ""determinist mechanical gene-driven hypothesis"" you are so keen to attribute to me. I really don't get why you refuse to address genetics at all . Every time someone brings up ""molecular chemistry"" (?) you idignantly refuse to get a doctorate in the ""subject,"" as if that were required in order to grasp the ideas at hand, and you then proceed to dismiss them. Ditto for statistics and probability, despite that what is being discussed are the variable characteristics among the individuals that comprise populations, and the ways and likelihoods of those characteristics changing over time. It's as if nothing in molecular genetics or population genetics counts as ""science"" to you. And that's just plain sad. I think it absolutely cripples your ability to grasp how the process of natural selection, that you so vehemently criticize, even works. But of course, I did not make this attribution! Because I do not think that all gene change is random, when we're talking about gene changes in populations , subject to differential survival and reproduction -- i.e., to natural selection, a non -random process that you have, yet again, left out. Fair enough. Which is a metaphysical abuse of the theory, not anything implied by the theory itself. There are plenty of evolutionists who don't share that metaphysic at all, and even plenty of evolutionists who are materialists reject using evolution to further their metaphysical views. Nuclear physics makes weapons of mass destruction possible. If one objects to such weapons, that hardly renders the physics faulty. Ah, so you do have an IDist axe to grind! But that would be ad hominem of me. What is less ad hominem is to point out that ""RM +NS "" certainly does incorporate something other than genes into the model, namely the entire set of environmental circumstances in which organisms find themselves. Even as you mention ""NS,"" you ignore it. Meanwhile, if you think there really is something ""non-corporeal"" at work here, get set explaining it. I'm not sure that it would or even could have anything to do with ""science,"" but you're welcome to persuade me otherwise. Gaia theory, perhaps? Or what? No, some materialists (e.g. Dawkins) are. It doesn't. You have got to distinguish the metaphysical views of a few vocal materialists with the empirical science of evolutionary biology itself. Show me the evidence! Don't just claim it. Prove it! Give me the grounds that show organisms ""attempting"" to change their own genomes! Tell me how to get into the conscious or subconscious ""mind"" of a bacterium or a snail or a mosquito or a fish or a finch or a bear so I can understand what it's ""attempting."" Because ""RM+NS"" ( don't forget the ""+NS"" ) can explain how these changes happen. Why is your ""teleological"" explanation preferable?

"02-17-2009","12214",10,"Peeling","344184","In our discussion, the closest you've come to an argument against the effects of random mutation is to say that the outcome is too predictable for the cause to be random. I'm more than willing to put my money where my mouth is. I'll bet a thousand pounds to your ten that if we play a thousand hands of poker I'll be dealt an Ace at some point. Come on; there are forty-eight cards in the pack that aren't aces - how can you lose? Or I'll bet you a thousand pounds to your one that someone somewhere will win the lottery this year. How can you possibly refuse when the odds are so manifestly in your favour? As it turns out, you knew perfectly well that argument was unfounded, as you revealed here: After spending umpteen posts denying it to my face, you implicitly acknowledge to someone else that empirical observations do match predictions based on a model of random mutation! So why did you drag the two of us all around the houses, rather than simply stating right from the outset: ""I know it looks like these mutations occur at random, but that's wrong because..."" ? We could have talked about all kinds of interesting things. Perhaps you thought I would behave boorishly if you made the slightest concession; I'm not offended by that presumption but I am a little disappointed.","jakers","344248","I have never argued against the effects of random genetic mutation in general. What I have actually asserted [and here repeat] is that adaptation by organisms to random changes in their environment is simply too common to be a matter of sheer good fortune. That is, that the concept of spontaneous, random, accidental, undirected, unspecified alterations in this DNA molecule or that one, whatever,[ya spins the wheel and ya takes ya chance], leading inevitably and immutably through the determinism of an organism's molecular mechanics to a change in the function, size, shape, operation, capacity or whatever of some portion or trait or property possessed by an organism--[a change, that is, which is meaningful, i.e.,non-trivial, enough to be remarked upon empirically as something truly novel, original, and at the same time adaptive, positive, and productive, [in the organism's own terms] that it may be said that that lifeform has in fact evolved, is so speculative, flimsy, hypothetical and lacking in scientific [empirical]] observation and testing that it is no better than a superstition. Sorry for the run -on, but I think the thought process is plain enough to follow without too much difficulty. Quite frankly I said at the start that I was only interested in debating the merits of ""Intelligent Design"" in this thread, not in attacking the standard geneticist/molecular biologist/statistician model for evolution's supposed source of causation. I believe that I stated plainly at that time, that statistics, and any suppositions derived from statistics, were of no interest to me, because I saw and see no reason to suppose that that arithmetic offers or provides anything empirically testable. Empirical, scientific observation of organisms and their traits, not their census numbers, nor any book-keeping wrt to the comparative ledger balance, plus or minus, wrt to the relative totals of specified DNA molecules between different organisms of the same kind. In addition, let me add that statistics do not explain themselves. They are measurements, observations, of numerical, arithmetical, effects, outcomes. Observations of effects does not explain the causes of said effects, but that is precisely what you geneticist/statistician/molecular biologists are trying to do with your antique bacteria experiments. You are trying to make a statistical effect the proof of an empirical cause, [random, accidental DNA molecule mutation] for an organismic phenomenon--evolution. Well, that's simply not science,and I'm not buying any, I've exposed and explained this flaw as it pertains to Luria-Delbruck and company. I've done so by pointing out properties which we now know bacteria to possess that were unknown in 1943, and which pretty much squelch the entire notion of anything, even an organism as primitive as a bacteria colony, evolving by happy accident alone, is preposterous. You simply hand-wave the findings of modern microbiology off like smoke, and pretend that what I'm saying, what I believe to be the scientific case, is merely some kind of stubborn refusal to face 'the facts' of statistics. Well, since all that statistics are is meaningless facts requiring interpretation before they mean a darn thing, what you are really saying is that I'm just being stubborn when I reject your interpretation of those facts. But the truth is, there is nothing, either in logic, reasoning, or science, that should compel me or anyone else to accept your interpretation of your statistics. ['quote] That's all you've ever said, and it's in defiance of basic statistics.[/quote] See, there you go, talking as if statistics, [which are numbers, which are nothing more than meaningless factual observations], are really meaningful in and of themselves alone! I've never challenged a fact. That would be silly, since by definition a fact is something indisputable. So I've never ""defied basic statistics"". I've simply noted that statistics are meaningless without a causal explanation for them, and that they do not ever explain themselves, and that all given explanations for supposed causes of statistical effects/facts are strictly hypothetical until empirically demonstrated by the scientific method. But you guys just want to wave off the scientific method of establishing causation and go straight from, 'these effects _look_ random , statistically -speaking', therefore their cause _actually is_ random'. Very bad science. I find that you have a very exagerated awe of statistics, what they are, and what they can and do contribute to hum understanding. I do not defy them, but unlike many [no offence?] I do do not bow down and venerate them for their own sakes. Now you're just trying for a laugh by offering absurdities. OK Excuse me?!?! Where and when did I ever 'deny to your face' that statistical number comparisons, as empirical observations, can compare positively [in statistics terms] to census expectations founded upon earlier observations of fact? Or indeed, where and when did I ever say that numerical outcomes cannot look stochastic, or cannot look stochastic if anyone predicts that they will look that way? I've never said any such thing. If you can quote me, with post number, please do so. Otherwise do not put words in my mouth, please and thank-you. I dragged nobody anywhere. I have never ever denied that the Luria-Delbruck stats looked like a random result. Instead, I pointed out, as I have always pointed out, that just because something resembles a random effect, that in no way shape or form proves that it had a random cause. NOT, that is unless you first assume that there are only 2 kinds of causes-1/mechanically determined, and 2/ random, i.e., stochastic. Given this false dichotomy as an a priori materialist assumption, if effects look regular and predictable, formed, regulated and constrained, then they are 'mechanical'. If not, then they are, perforce, random. Problem is the false dichotomy, because, in my view and that of several billion other people, there is a third alternative to the determined/random dichotomy--teleology. Intention. And the fact is that facts, results, outcomes, both those that resemble products of ordered and predictable mechanical causation, but also those that look like disordered, accidental, and random products, can both be truly the result neither of determined, nor of random, causation; but rather, of teleological causation. Intelligence and volition. You cannot distinguish these causes simply by looking at effects.You and the others that still believe that Luria-Delbruck actually proved anything on the basis of appearances still do so, but that's your philosophy, not science, talking.","intelligent-designs-black-box","02:59 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","145"

Post 64 I think that is the one who assumes a regular, repeatable, predictable, but totally random, utterly stochastic, brand new, disassociated set of two [on/off] genetic mutations. I wouild say that such an appeal to such dependably iterated good luck not only would offend Ockham, but common sense as well. It smacks of superstition, to me. Post 79 Problem is, they regularly and predictably develop resistance over time. Putting that down to lucky accidents in the form of genetic mutations is, again, a children's fable. Post 79 Speed and specificity and regularity. That is , their resistance/immunity happens way too often, way too fast, and way too specific to cause, to simply be a matter of happy accident, of chance mutation. Post 88 The only reason you call such a regularity, 'random', is because that is what you'd like it to be--a 'random mechanism', a self-contradictory oxymoron, because that would help it fit into your a priori assumptions of what everything is all about. But anybody without ideological blinkers firmly in place can see that bacterial resistance, even way back in 1943, was never, is never, a matter of chance. Post 91 Anything that happens with a dependable, predictable regularity, is not random.

I wouldn't dream of claiming random mutation is responsible for all organismic adaptation. I wouldn't dream of dismissing the last sixty years of research into the biology of bacteria and other organisms. But RM is unquestionably happening ; it's a part of the grand biological process whether we like it or not. I don't have a philosophical axe to grind here; I don't have a 'materialist agenda'. I just want to get the clearest possible picture of what's actually happening, warts and all. And to do that we can't just brush contributing factors like RM under the carpet and pretend they don't exist or don't matter. We need to fully understand their contribution so that our understanding of everything else isn't grossly distorted. Recall the poker analogy, which I think was the closest we came to a meeting of minds. You talked about 'aces up sleeves' and suchlike, and it's certainly the case that organisms possess developmental contingencies to a greater or lesser extent. Let's examine that analogy in more detail. Are you familiar with Texas Hold'em? Each player is dealt two cards, and must make the best hand he can with five further cards dealt to the table. This game is a particularly good analogy because the player's two 'hole' cards can be thought of as his genes, and those dealt to the table, the environment in which he and all his fellow players are living. So while, as you suggested, a player can possess developmental contingencies (cards up his sleeve) they are only effective within a limited range of environmental peturbation. Where biology and poker sharply diverge is in the way the 'cards' are dealt to the players and the table. In poker there is no continuity: the 'genes' and 'environment' are shuffled and re-dealt each hand. The effect of this is to render the influence of the cards neutral over the long term, so that winning or losing is in the end a matter of player skill and strategy. In biology on the other hand there is genetic and environmental continuity, and that changes everything. Imagine a game where the shared cards remain on the table, with maybe one or two changing occasionally. The same happens with the players' cards: kept from hand to hand with one changing occasionally. And the winner(s) of each hand get to give a copy of their cards to another player for the next round. The 'best' hands proliferate and the 'worst' abate - best and worst being strictly in the context of the environmental cards on the table, of course. And so the 'gene pool' will, after a fashion, blindly track the environmental changes. In this version of the game we've removed all skill and strategy, and reproduction of cards is asexual, so it's a very limited analogy for biology. You're absolutely right that in macroscopic, sexually reproducing species adaptation does not tally with the occurrence of random mutation, and bacteria possess many contingent mechanisms or behaviours. But that doesn't mean RM+NS can't 'work', or has no influence in the grand scheme of things. It just means that in order to detect unalloyed RM+NS it's necessary to filter out other evolutionary factors, something which is most readily achieved in the lab with bacteria. We agree that pertinent mutations have been shown to arise, during colony growth, in a statistically stochastic pattern prior to environmental change. There is no empirical evidence of it being a response to the colony achieving a 'critical mass', or indeed a response to anything at all. Up to this point the possibility remains that, as you would prefer, the genetic dice are being rolled on purpose by the bacteria as insurance against future environmental change. They can't know what's coming, or predict the effects of mutation, so a degree of randomised biodiversity is about the best strategy one could hope for under the circumstances. Does that sound fair enough? That hypothesis fails when we investigate causes of mutation. The empirical fact that the rate of mutations - both adaptive and maladaptive - increases linearly with radiation dosage indicates the genetic dice-rolls are inadvertent: externally induced, unintentional. This fact does not vindicate philosophical materialism or determinism in the slightest, it is merely a truth we must factor into our model of evolution: among random mutations there are those that do turn out to be pertinent to future environmental changes, and in bacterial colonies of billions those individually rare events are sufficient to explain our observations of evolutionary adaptation under controlled circumstances. I say again for the record: this is not the be-all and end-all of evolution. It is merely one ongoing, inevitable process which we must recognise and accept, or else be led into grave error. That's not what I claimed you denied. You denied that random mutation could be a sufficiently reliable process - reliability being a statistical measurement - to account for the regularity of results from tests like L&D. I've included several supporting links below. The comparison in question was not, as you now claim, between observations and census expectations based on previous observation, but between observation and prediction based on hypothesis. By saying that the occurrence of bacterial resistance is too regular to be explained by random mutation, you are denying the statistical math that leads us to expect precisely the observed degree of regularity given a tiny finite chance of mutation per cell division - ie, replication error. I know. Nevertheless, you attempted to deny that the results of the L&D test indicated stochastic mutation: I'm sorry, but you repeatedly denied, to myself and to others, that the L&D results matched the expectations of a hypothesis of random mutation: I could go on, but I think the point is proved. You said I must be 'superstitious', wearing 'ideological blinkers', prone to believing in 'children's fables' - hardly the words of someone who accepts that the predictions of the RM hypothesis match our observations. And time and time again you explicitly said the outcome, the effect , was too reliable, too regular, too predictable - more denial of the correlation between RM's predictions and our observations. You offered an alternative teleological cause, but the only argument you leveled against RM, other than scorn, was that RM could not explain the observed effects. An argument you've since admitted is incorrect. Correct. You distinguish between causes by bombarding organisms with radiation and observing the linear elevation in their mutation rates. L&D on its own directly proves that mutations occurred stochastically during cell growth prior to environmental change. It eliminates the possibility of the underlying mechanism being responsive. Bombardment with radiation, and the observation of linear change in mutation rates, eliminates the remaining uncertainty as to whether the mechanism is endogenous - a deliberate strategy - or exogenous (environmentally induced and unintentional). Once again, this is not the sum total of evolutionary processes. But it is one of them, it is part of the whole.

"02-18-2009","12214",10,"Matthew","344218","The thesis was not that ""'variation is undirected [toward adaptation] .'"" That would be a manifest contradiction, so it's hardly surprising that the evidence for it is non-existent. But I do thank you for using those brackets and differentiating what I actually said from the straw man you're keen to knock around. What I said was, ""variation is undirected."" This is because variation sometimes makes organisms more adapted to their environments, but it often makes them less so, and many times has no effect at all. Variation happens, and it doesn't have an intrinsic tendency toward adaptation. That is Lamarck's hypothesis -- and there is no evidence for it. Organisms don't try to direct their physiology and behavior toward adaptation. They try to survive, and they try to reproduce.","jakers","344301","Up to this point our discussion has been pleasant. But your tone is now turning towards that of others that I automatically ignore. You will not hear from me again should this persist. The confusion between us here is that you are speaking of 'variation' _after_ it has been created and inherited, whereas I have been speaking of the creation of novel variation, i.e., evolution. Please specify that you are talking about 'ex post facto' variation, inherited variation, when that is what you intend. Whenever you say something like ""Variation happens, and it doesn't have an intrinsic tendency toward adaptation."", you lead me to believe that you are talking, not of existing inherited and established variation, but of the creation of novel, original variety in addition to that which inheritance brings with it. And of that you offer that it just ""happens"", as in the vulgarity ""sh-t happens"", spontaneously, for no mechanical nor teleological reasons. That it simply does, out of nowhere and nothing, by pure random chance i.e., the intrinsic systemic entropy of a 'genetic copying error' , or a toxic deformation of a DNA molecule by some external mutagen. You don't speak of 'genes', here, but I don't think I am offering a ""strawman"" by interposing them into the thought, since I do not believe that you meant that organismic trait variations simply popped into existence altogether on their own, willy-nilly. OTH, I speak of the evolution of novel, original variation, something beyond the standard parameters of established trait variation for any given species. I do not believe that such creation is an uncaused event, nor do I believe that the causation of such events must be either chemically mechanical -[determinist], or stochastically spontaneous, i.e., random. I believe that there is also a third alternative, something based in what Ian has called ""mind-stuff"", which, as intelligently directed volition, aka, 'intelligent design'. is also capable of shaping ,changing, developing, i.e., informing, organismic traits, including brand-new, original, evolved traits. I am not at all concerned with the 'ex post facto' consequences involved ecologically between a certain species or a certain variety of a given species, ex post facto, after it has been expressed and exposed to its environment with whatever distinct individual trait combination it has. It goes without saying, as a truism, that if it expresses traits that match its needs to what the environment has on offer, it thrives. If it doesn't, it does poorly, and quite often perishes. It takes no scientist to say that the better suited [adapted] to a given situation one is, the better off one is. That's mere tautology, and basically, that is all that ""Natural Selection"" does say. I am strictly concerned with that which causes novelty, originality, diversity, and unprecedented variety in lifeforms over time. That is what I call evolution--the origination of novel biological traits, and the causes for that phenomenon are all that interest me. ""NS"" would happen no matter whether 'random mutation' did it, god did it, mother nature did it, the fairies did it, or nothing did it, it simply happened to happen all by itself, spontaneously self-generated. As it hap[pens, I choose ""none of the above"" did it. Unless you interpret the word 'god' very , very broadly, well beyond the bounds of any earthly religion of which I am aware. That's your opinion, you're entitled to it, it is in fact the ruling and most popular opinion, but I respectfully disagree with it. How can you admit this, and at the same time deny their efforts to adapt themselves to the living conditions in which they find themselves? Trying to survive and trying to reproduce are acts of trying to adapt. They are wilful, aka teleological, actions. If you admit, as here you do, to teleology in the everyday adaptive behaviour of organisms, where do you find the right to banish teleology from the long-term, generational adaptive behaviour [evolution] of lineages of organisms? You either must do what the last die-hard materialists, such as that fellow, Richard Dawkins, do, and claim that life-forms, organisms, are mere automatons, robots, zombies, whatever, that have no teleology in them. That, despite empirical appearances, they merely react mechanically in ways determined chemically by 'the laws of physics', without anything like true 'intelligence' or true 'volition' involved. Just mere passive subjection to the external compulsions of the material world batting them this way and that, like billiard balls. ""Variation just happens"", and so on.
