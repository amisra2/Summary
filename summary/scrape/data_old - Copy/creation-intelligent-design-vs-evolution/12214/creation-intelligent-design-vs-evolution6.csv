"01-31-2009","12214",6,"Matthew","342111","The obvious fact is that organisms are adapted to their environments. What is not obvious is what has caused that fact. And that's what I thought was at issue here: not whether organisms are adapted to their environments, but why. What's also not obvious (to me, at any rate) is what exactly you have in mind by speaking of ""teleology."" Perhaps an example will help. Must we invoke final causes to explain why, say, a polar bear is adapted to cold environments? (Or see the bacterium example below. But I'd like to see what you have to say about the polar bears, too.) But in the case of evolution, what exactly is doing this ""looking for?"" Or maybe not what, but who ?","jakers","342510","Hi; That is what I thought, too. But apparently that was not Peeling's intention when he started this thread. Now it has come to a question of whether organisms evolve by design or by genetic accident. Is teleology involved or is it a case of, "" things change, willy-nilly, and what you see today is just what was lucky enough to change in a way that suited the fickle finger of blind, random, environmental fluctuations"". To me there is no way that you can claim that anything 'adapted' to anything without speaking teleologically, or poetically. Poetically, as in, the water adapted to the drop in temperature by freezing, or the branch adapted to the rise in temperature by catching fire. The online dictionaries all say something like-- Adapt # (a.) Fitted; suited. # (v. t.) To make suitable; to fit, or suit; to adjust; to alter so as to fit for a new use; -- sometimes followed by to or for. Therefore the original [and only true and legitimate] meaning for 'fitness for' something, is also teleological. To be 'fit for' is always to 'be suitable for'. I do not see how the words 'adapted' and 'fitted' can be separated from each other wrt the words 'environment' and 'evolution'. Thus both ""Survival of the Fittest"" and ""Natural Selection"" imply a value judgement made by something or other, real or imaginary, and that makes such expressions intrinsically teleological and clearly opposite any inference of chance or mechanics. Well, to me teleology is a part of the concept of 'causation' in philosophy. That is, it sometimes plays a part in explaining what caused a certain effect, or outcome. Thus, to me, teleology is part of an Aristotelian tradition of causation, that is his 'final cause'. Anything that suggests that a 'change action' was started with a view, be it vague or clearly defined, to a desired end, is teleological. Anything that makes a value judgement on the lines of 'good, better, best', etc., wrt to itself and the world around it, is teleological. Thus anything capable of recognising itself as a 'self', an individual being distinguishable from the rest of the universe, is teleological. The concepts of 'mind', 'intelligence'. awareness'. 'volition', 'free will', 'choice', 'judgement', 'selection', 'fitness', 'suitability', 'purpose', 'use', 'intention', 'goal', 'objective', 'motive' and a thousand others are plainly teleological. To put in its simplest terms, teleology is present where a mental activity assesses a present state of affairs, makes a conscious or unconscious judgement wrt its impact on the being experiencing the mental activity, and this judgement has an effect on what that 'judge' does, and what the result of that action will be. Many people, especially of late, have ridiculed teleology as being a philosophy which insists that everything that exists, got to be where it is and how it is through the conscious efforts of some wilful external agent or agency, usually referred to as a god. [but sometimes 'evolution', That is not my belief. I am not here to deny the presence of random chance as an intrinsic part of reality. I believe that accidents do happen. Nor I am I here to deny mechanics. Observation shows us that there is law and order in this universe, because certain causes can be depended upon to lead to certain ends, time after time. I am here simply to say that where living organisms are concerned, what they do in their own lives, and over the 'lifespans' of their 'lifeforms', is not a simple matter of chemical iterations nor inexplicable failures of molecular iterations, but that there is 'something else' in 'life' itself which exercises power over the mechanics/operations/behaviours of sentient, self-aware, mentally-endowed beings, a power exercised right down to the molecular level. An intrinsic teleological power. The power to _act_ upon the world, and just to be a passive 'thing' that it acts upon. I say that you have to invoke a final cause anytime you claim that something is 'adapted' to anything. To 'adapt' yourself, or anything else, to something else, is always a teleological act. A senseless thing can 'conform' to the laws of physics and chemistry, but it can never 'adapt' to them. 'Adaptation' always connotes awareness and intention. Conformance and compliance do not. I believe that insentient matter complies and conforms entirely, passively, in reaction to whatever external forces act upon it. I believe that sentient lifeforms, i.e., living organisms, internally affect and direct what happens to the insentient matter within themselves, just as they act upon the insentient matter external to them, though by no means in the same way or to the same extent. Polar bears are white [sort of], and their ice flow environment is whitish as well. Therefore we may suppose that polar bear fur colour is another instance of natural camouflage, a phenomenon widespread throughout the natural world. Camouflage, in and of itself, [along with 'mimicry'] is an extremely interesting and mysterious phenomenon. Great topic. But for our purposes, the polar bear, once a grizzly bear kind of bear, somehow sensed that it caught more seals on ice flows when the seal couldn't see them, and, unconsciously picking up on the fact that the ice and snow around it were white, succeeded, teleologically, in making its offspring successively less brown and more white. How subconscious awareness of surroundings cause organisms to change themselves to suit, either intantly or over a generation or so, is quite a mystery. But claiming that all the brown bears died, and only mutant white bears survived, is, to me, a children's story. I do not know. For lack of a better word, I could say 'the psyche'. Whatever ""it"" is, it is intrinsic to ""life"". Now, I have heard some people say that there is no such thing as 'life'. That is only 'matter', acting mechanically. I do not like to argue with people who deny the obvious--that is, a live thing does things that a dead thing cannot, even though all of the 'matter' is still there. So that therefore there is a true and real difference between an organism that possesses something called 'life', and another one that does not. Well. enough for now. I'll get back to this in a while. Later.","intelligent-designs-black-box","07:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","78"

I'm sorry to hear that. All of the above, I believe. I suspect that you are being, shall we say, disingenuous, since I cannot believe that you cannot put ""genetic accident"" together with ""random genetic mutation"". Surely you are familiar with that? Well, no, not really. I'm talking about random events [mutagenic random events] which change _the genes_ in an organism [i.e., 'mutate' one or more of them] to the extent that the organism's offspring [and their 'genes'][i.e., 'mutants'] are at least somewhat different from those carried, up to that moment, by it's ancestors' offspring. Lots of things can change the genetic makeup of any given population. The Nazis tried to change the genetic makeup of the European population by killing all the Jews and Gypsies. Thankfully, they failed, but they did kill enough, I would wager, to have changed ""the genetic makeup"" of Europe. Statistically, at least. Or, put another way, just adding one more hen to a coop can change that flock's ""genetic makeup"". Well, if you choose to make an enemy of everybody who disagrees with you, you've picked the proper way to go about it. Poisoning the well by accusing others of deliberate ignorance will not bring anyone over to your point of view. If any of the above are intentional or mechanical, then they do not deserve to be called 'accidental', 'random', 'coincidental', 'fortuitous', 'chance' or 'just plain lucky'. If, OTH, the presence of mechanics and/or or intent is denied, then how else are they to be described other than in those terms? Well, that is basically what I was referring to, but since you bring up these other things, perhaps I should include them under the same heading. Unless, of course, you can show that ""gene flow, recombination, and genetic drift"" are mechanical and/or intentional, then they won't deserve to be called 'random', 'accidental', etc. What ""Taint so?"" That ""the word design implies some intelligent cause""? It does. That's just the way it is. So what are you saying? In that case, since there are only the three alternatives, then those 'mechanisms' must be true 'mechanisms', i.e., chains of events that are mechanically determined and predictable, that cannot be altered or avoided. None of that verbiage relates to the plain English word 'to select', or to any of its cognates. All you are doing is offering the tautology that, 'things that do better, do better'. 'Selection' just ain't in this stuff. Neither is anything else. Instead of natural selection, just say ""Natural Success"". ""Success breeds success!"", and so on. ""Prosperity of the Successful"", to coin a phrase. Well, it would be nice if they didn't just suggest what it does, but actually said what, in scientific as opposed to literary terms, it _is_. I suggest to you that anything that is not mechanical is not a mechanism, as such. At least in material terms. However, I do admit of psychological 'mechanisms' as well as material ones. I do not admit of 'accidental mechanisms', since that is an oxymoron, but that does seem to be what you are trying to put forward. Sexual selection, in the rare cases where it is actually present, is true 'selection' because it is something done by a sentient being, a live organism. An awful lot of 'mate acquisition' has little to do with any real choice. But forget about that for now. This appears to be a genuine instance of choice, selection, based upon a certain 'value judgement', and is thus intentional, and not accidental. It also makes it teleological, unless you can show a determined, inflexible, unavoidable chemical progression from the eye of the peahen to the act of copulation. In which case it is not selection/choice, since it is compelled. The ladies will not, I think, thank you for that one. Well, I only meant to assert my opinion that there is a teleological element in biological evolution. I had no intention of taking a course in genetics. I still don't, not really. I know that that is what you believe, but you'll have to prove it to me. And, BTW, ""random mechanisms"" is still an oxymoron. Well, since I'm not taking your course, I don't have to do your quizzes, do I?","intelligent-designs-black-box","01:15 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","81"

Nor was it intended to be, since I make no pretense of being what is commonly called a scientist. True. But I think that the belief in a truly determinist reality has already been proved false by quantum theory. So absolute determinism is already in the wastebasket, 'mind-stuff' or no 'mind-stuff'. Which is another reason to assert the true existence of 'mind-stuff' in reality, including the reality of this universe. Not necessarily. The organism's 'mind-stuff' must necessarily be aware, even if unconsciously aware. But all it needs to be aware of is it's current state of well-being. It helps to be aware of what is contributing to a state of well or ill being, but at the very basic level, all that is needed is an attraction to this or a repulsion to that, based upon unconscious awareness and 'knowledge' of how 'this' or 'that' have, in the past or currently, have done or are positively or negatively affecting the 'self's' state of being, existence. In other words, not all organisms contain, or perhaps, have access to, the same amount, or perhaps quality, of 'mind-stuff'. The development of of organisms that are very passive and reactive to organisms that are very dynamic and proactive seems to be a large part of biological evolution. If by ""biological methods"", you mean is aware of its 'self' and its own 'biology', and how to 'own and operate' that biological 'self', i.e., to adjust, alter, and adapt that biology [knowledge of physical system, make-up and operation]then , yes, it must be at least unconsciously [or subconsciously, I'm not sure which is the better word] aware of how and to what extent it can act. Yes. How 'often' and/or how 'serious' ""mistakes"" are made are contingent upon a/the quantity of problems to be solved, the number of proximate and immediate needs and wants to be satisfied, b/, the quality, i.e., seriousness [life or death], degree of change/adaptation required, the degree of complexity inherent in the situation, and c/ the amount and/or quality of 'mind-stuff' which the organism has, or has access to. No. If the 'parent' did not have its own 'mind-stuff' operating on it, it could do nothing to enable its offspring's 'mind-stuff' to work on, to develop, to adapt, itself. No 'new-born' so to speak, has to start from its parents', 'square one'. The changes wrought in a parent in its life struggles with its own world affect its potential offspring before it even has anything started. Well, lots of things change the features of an individual during that individual's lifetime, intentionally or unintentionally. Just plain old development and aging will do that, among a million others. The issue is whether or not some changes undergone by a parent in its lifetime can in any way carry on to, be inherited by, its offspring. Obviously accidental changes that have nothing to do with adaptedness do not. Scarred faces, lost arms or tails or foreskins, are not inheritable. That does not mean that internally induced organismic changes brought on by the organism's 'mind-stuff' assessing and acting upon its state of well-being cannot and do not get passed on to its offspring, not ever, ever. As a matter of fact, modern developmental biology is, I believe, far more in line with Lamarck's ideas on evolution's mechanism/s than with the reigning 'genetic mechanics/determinism'+random mutation' paradigm. Then why hasn't the assumption of a ""Natural Selector"", aka ""Flying Spaghetti Monster"", not eliminated Darwin's allegorical hypothesis from science classrooms? Why hasn't the foolishness of the oxymoron of ""random mechanisms"" or ""mechanical randomness"" not been eliminated from science classes? Is it because 'scientists' like to be allowed to cherry-pick what is to be called 'science', and what is not, strictly on the basis of their personal philosophical preferences? Anything random is not, by definition, a mechanism, because all mechanisms are founded upon regularity, dependability, and predictability, i.e., mechanical determinism. That is why 'random mechanism' is an absurd contradiction in terms. Nothing can be both 'random' and 'mechanically determined' at the same time. Obviously, because I no longer find the old paradigm satisfactory. The instances in which I found it less than convincing are too numerous to go over. Suffice it to say, in view of what we have learned about organisms, how they operate, how they develop, etc., over the past 50 years, has simply rendered the current paradigm obsolete. IMHO. Granted, it is difficult, at least at times, to discern whether or not an event/outcome arose by accident or by intent. But it is certain that dice do not come into existence 'by accident', nor do they get thrown 'by accident' nor do the results get analysed, 'by accident'. So even tales of coin and die tossing and other wonders of statistical arithmetic and 'probability theory' are not, in and of themselves, random or accidental. I know that that is the story that has dominated evolutionary biology for the past 80 years. I just don't accept it any longer. What makes you say that? The assumption seems unwarranted, to me. Well, if I find time to look for and at it, I will. But as I've said often enough already, I'm not here to take a course of study; especially not one designed in accordance with someone else's opinions. I just want a light, pleasant discussion of the what, how, and why of life form evolution.","intelligent-designs-black-box","01:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","85"

Therefore, Darwin's theory of natural selection acting on random mutations applies to bacteria as well as to more complex organisms.

"02-01-2009","12214",6,"jakers","342058","(Re: observed evidence for Darwinian evolution) And there's your problem. Even according to your own theory it should be fallacious to suppose that just because any individual or any particular population has never encountered such an environment, that they have not inherited a mechanism from their ancestors who had already, and perhaps millions of times, encountered and devised a mechanism to deal with that very problem. If the problem environment can be shown, or even supposed, to be one that has come and gone repeatedly over million, billions, trillions, of bacteria generations, there is no reason to suppose that any given population of same has to rely on random chance, a lucky genetic mutation, to stochastically 're-invent the wheel' for the gazillioneth time. It seems top me that I am not the one who is making erroneous a priori philosophical assumptions that 'violate' Ockham's razor. I think that is the one who assumes a regular, repeatable, predictable, but totally random, utterly stochastic, brand new, disassociated set of two [on/off] genetic mutations. I wouild say that such an appeal to such dependably iterated good luck not only would offend Ockham, but common sense as well. It smacks of superstition, to me. This word, 'stacking', although quite familiar to me, seems to used by you in a sense that to me is entirely unfamiliar. Could you outline your novel use of this word, and explain just exactly what it means in terms of DNA molecules and expressed organic traits? However, I can argue that relative frequency, speed, efficiency, and specificity by which a change in life forms arise in relation to a novel environmental difference which makes that change 'positive', as opposed to neutral [ineffective] or negative [detrimental] can give reasonable grounds to awarding the accomplishment to some intentional agency rather than a great streak of amazing luck. Fine. I'll continue to assert that evolution is a process of organismic adaptation to random environmental change, and you can stop using the word 'adaptive', or any of its cognates, or synonyms, wrt evolution. Darwin must be rolling over in his grave, but he's dead, so that's his problem. And my problem with you, all along, is your incredibly cavalier attitude towards words and their true meanings. there is no legitimate way that one person, or select group of persons, can unilaterally and arbitrarily impose a new meaning on a word without the express consent of all others with whom they use that word in any act of communication, This is a flagrant example of 'special pleading'. I can't remember the exact names of the logical fallacies it falls under. What special case?!? LIFE? Life was around long before language was invented. Which might be convincing if you could demonstrate it just as easily using other life forms. Another 'special case' for 'special pleading', it sounds like to me. Exceptions are not the foundations for the rule. I appreciate the fact that if I wish to drink a glass of beer I need the beer, a hand an elbow, a throat and stomach, among other physical things. I also require thirst, taste, satisfaction, and a lot of other stuff that I would not have were I not also alive, and acting teleologically.","Peeling","342614","Sorry it's taken me so long to reply - I've been very busy with other commitments. Certainly organisms do possess mechanisms for dealing with common (but irregularly-encountered) environmental changes. You can recognise them because they kick in after the environment changes, not before. There are three main flaws with that argument. First of all, it wrongly presumes that the random, lucky genetic mutation stochastically 're-inventing the wheel' is somehow a defective or unreliable mechanism for generating the 'enzyme' in question on all those occasions. It's not. In a quite modestly-sized bacterial colony every multi-billion-to-one mutation will be amply represented purely through replication error. So supposing the existence of a responsive mechanism ready to generate each and every one is entirely unnecessary, on top of being implausible. Where are all these mechanisms? There isn't nearly enough genome to describe them all, even theoretically. Secondly, if a bacterial species had developed a responsive mechanism for dealing with an environmental change after being exposed to it millions of times over, we would expect it to work on an individual level a bit better than the one-in-ten-billion times or so it empirically does in the examples we're talking about - a rate that is on the other hand remarkably congruent with typical rates of genetic mutation. And of course, there's the awkward fact that mutants arise, stochastically, prior to and in the absence of the environmental changes to which they could be considered adaptive. I hardly think it appropriate to describe straightforward statistics as 'superstition' Pick a number from one to six and then roll a die. Did you guess right? Now ask twenty people to pick a number, and then roll a die. Did one of them guess right? Now enter the lottery. Did you win? Now get fifty million people to enter the lottery. Did one of them win? The math doesn't become invalid just because the numbers get bigger. I hardly think it's a novel use of the word. Plates stack, effects stack... mutations stack. And because they're stochastic, any given mutation is most likely to occur to the offspring of the most numerically prevalent variant of an organism - thus adding to their particular 'stack' of accumulated variations rather than to a different organism's 'stack'. You can certainly try . In bacteria, the argument fails because the demonstrable pre-existence of mutants represents effectively instant 'adaptation'. Is 'instant' fast enough for you? In sexually-reproducing organisms, the argument fails for somewhat more complex reasons. I really don't think it's a good idea to get into that right now. As I've said all along, I'll do my best to accomodate your needs. If that means avoiding using the word 'adaptive' in conjuncton with evolution, fine. Well, I can only apologise for causing your problems. Now, why is it I'm not seeing Humpty Dumpty, but an image of a monkey with his hands over his ears, sitting next to one with his hands over his mouth? You're correct that I cannot force you to accept a phrase such as 'ateleological adaption' as valid. But I can use it to converse with other people who share my understanding of it, and I can explain to those who don't what is meant by it, so that they might understand me in future. You are entirely free to abstain - which makes it much more difficult to talk to you but has no implications whatsoever for which of us is ultimately right. Hardly. Is it 'special pleading' to say that the result of division is uniquely undefined when the operand is zero? Or merely stating a logical truth? Evolutionary processes can be used, to find solutions that are 'better' according to pretty much any criteria. As you say, that both logically and semantically entails teleology: choosing a goal and then selection criteria to cause the system to converge upon that goal. No argument there. But in the unique instance of the 'goal' being better self-replication, any hypothetical teleological agent need only stand back and watch. In the absence of any externally-imposed criteria, a pool of stochastically variable self-replicators will inevitably converge upon better self-replicating variants, if they exist in potentia. It's not special pleading, it's just true. But the theory of evolution wasn't. Prior to that, we had no need to get our brains around the idea of an 'ateleologically adaptive' process, so we didn't need or have words for it. And if you have your way, we never will I'm not using bacteria as an exception. I'm using them because focusing on single-celled, asexually-reproducing organisms allows us to work comfortably with the large populations and rapid reproduction rates necessary to see genetic mutation, the slowest of evolutionary mechanisms, in operation. It's the simplest and clearest way to disprove the supposed universal principle that random changes cannot increase reproductive rates. That doesn't mean you developed a hand, elbow, throat and stomach in order to satisfy your desire to drink beer; it just means you've come up with something entertaining to do with the organs you already had. Have you ever played poker? That's a classic example of what we're talking about here. There's a telic layer to the game, and a random layer. The best players win statistically more often than the worst players, despite them both being dealt the same average quality of hands, in the long run. That's the telic layer. But it's also true that the best hands win statistically more often than the worst hands, despite them being dealt equally to both good and bad players. In life we may believe there's a telic layer, and that success and failure is influenced by that layer. Even if that's true, there's also a random layer to the game, and it too influences the outcome. The difference between life and poker is that in poker the crappy hands keep getting dealt out with the same frequency, forever - whereas in life the crappy genetic hands tend to lose 'market share', as it were. Unless the telic layer is deliberately acting perversely to prevent that happening, it's simply inevitable. Anyway, it's really late (again) and I need to tidy the kitchen before bed. So I'll leave it there.","intelligent-designs-black-box","08:35 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","90"
