"01-27-2009","12214",5,"pandion","341965","That's a fact! Evolution isn't an agent or a mechanism. It is an observation. Organisms have changed through the ages and are still being observed to change in response to their environment. Thus, mechanisms like mutation, gene flow, recombination (non-random mating), natural selection, sexual selection, genetic drift, biased variation, and movable elements have been observed to effect changes in the genetic makeup of populations over time. And that is evolution. But evolution doesn't ""do"" anything. The word ""evolution"" is applied to the definition of events that constitute evolution (a change in the allele frequency of populations of organisms over generations), observations of events that fit the definition, and theories that explain the events. Then you haven't looked. You haven't read Darwin, since that is one of the basic points he pointed out 150 years ago based on the evidence he observed. We observe a great deal of genetic diversity in most organisms. Even humans, a species of quite limited genetic diversity due to a population bottleneck a couple hundred thousand years ago, carry an average of 14 alleles for every gene in the genome.","jakers","342040","Thank-you, Pandion, for supporting me on this point.

Individual organisms do not evolve. Populations do. As to ""changes in the actual forms that express life,"" it sounds like what you're talking about is changes to organisms' phenotypes , and even perhaps just to their observable anatomy. But changes to genotypes underlie changes to phenotypes. Not true! Phenotypes change precisely because genotypes change. True, on all accounts. But science is not limited to explanations in terms of ""what we can observe with the naked eye!"" Indeed. But guess what? Modern genetics has corroborated the idea, in ways that aren't always visible, and that Darwin could never have dreamed of. I'm sorry, but you totally lost me here. How does the hypothesis depend on all possible trait variations pre-existing their expression? I don't think I've ever seen that said or even implied. It sounds far too Platonist for an empirical science. Could you clarify? If two individuals differ in a given allele, then at that point in their DNA, the molecules are precisely not the same! The coding sequences are different, and they thus get expressed differently, and they therefore produce different phenotypic effects. On the other hand, even the same allele doesn't work similarly under all conditions. Your own DNA is the same in every cell in your body, but fortunately, not every portion of it is active in every cell. Those genes encoding, say, muscle proteins aren't active in your brain cells -- which is fortunate, or we wouldn't be having this discussion! The process of gene expression is controlled chemically, via mechanisms that biologists are only beginning to understand. But they are beginning to understand them -- and they still haven't found it necessary to invoke final causes to do it! The process is chemistry, all the way down. I'm not going to pretend to be an expert. But there are lots of readable sources out there for this stuff.

"01-27-2009","12214",5,"Peeling","341997","I couldn't agree more. So when, for instance, a mutation in bacterial DNA is demonstrably both necessary and sufficient for a replication-improving trait to manifest, when the chemical activity of the novel enzyme (for instance) deterministically generated from that DNA can be traced to its effect upon organismic fitness, and the mutation demonstrably arises stochastically prior to the bacterium encountering the environment in which the mutation improves replication, it would violate Ockham's Razor to suppose the existence of some unknown teleological mechanism at work, based solely on an a priori philosophical assumption that only teleological processes can increase the replication chances of complex systems. Simpler by far to acknowledge the sufficiency of what we see before us to explain the phenomenon, and discard the erroneous philosophical assumption. Population fluctuations in absolute terms can, as you say, occur for many reasons. But fluctuations in the relative proportions of variants comprising that population are influenced by what you would call the relative 'fitness' of those variants in their environment. And those fluctuations in turn inevitably influence the relative chances of future changes stacking with the different variants already in existence. If there are a lot of variant A and only a few of variant B, the chances of a later change stacking with A is much greater than that of it stacking with B. So if a change - random or telic - empirically improves the relative statistical chance of self-replication, that mutant will inevitably come to numerically dominate the population. Agreed? If you take the position that 'adaptive' implies teleology by definition, then obviously an ateleological but adaptive process is a semantic contradiction. It doesn't stop a process of ateleological self-replication improvement occurring, it just means we can't call it adaptive. Now personally , I'm comfortable with saying 'ateleological adaptation', because to me that describes something that has the same effect as adaptation, but isn't telic. Since semantics do not define objective truth, I don't see why putting those two words together should make me automatically wrong. 'Ateleological' is just a qualifier. The same goes for 'natural selection', a phrase chosen at the time for the express purpose of leading the reader from a concept they're comfortable and familiar with (livestock breeding) and showing them how the rigours of the environment result in an analogous effect , even if the actual process lacks the telic qualities implied by 'selection'. As I've said all along, self-replication with variation is an utterly unique special case, the only situation in which statistically rare improvements can accumulate, and statistically common neutral or deleterious changes abate, without the interference of a telic entity. It's hardly surprising that it's difficult to find appropriate words, when the words we have were defined in ignorance of that one special case. I know there is much, much more to evolution than mutation and differential reproductive rates. There are two reasons I focus on those elements here and now. First, their combined effectiveness is relatively straightforward to demonstrate, using asexually reproducing bacteria. I neither deny teleology per se, nor do I claim adaptation has no role in evolutionary biology. What I'm saying is that whatever effect they have it is inevitably layered atop known ateleological effects. Do you appreciate the distinction? Ateleological processes that improve an organism's fitness will continue to blindly operate regardless of whether or not the organism itself is telic. There is no all or nothing dichotomy.","jakers","342058","And there's your problem. Even according to your own theory it should be fallacious to suppose that just because any individual or any particular population has never encountered such an environment, that they have not inherited a mechanism from their ancestors who had already, and perhaps millions of times, encountered and devised a mechanism to deal with that very problem. A mechanism that could hold a certain enzyme action in abeyance until such time as it was necessary to release it again, even if that mechanism was a genetic 'allele' or whatever. If the problem environment can be shown, or even supposed, to be one that has come and gone repeatedly over million, billions, trillions, of bacteria generations, there is no reason to suppose that any given population of same has to rely on random chance, a lucky genetic mutation, to stochastically 're-invent the wheel' for the gazillioneth time. That is, no reason to suppose such a thing unless you really, really want such a phenomenon to be purely accidental. It seems top me that I am not the one who is making erroneous a priori philosophical assumptions that 'violate' Ockham's razor. I think that is the one who assumes a regular, repeatable, predictable, but totally random, utterly stochastic, brand new, disassociated set of two [on/off] genetic mutations. I wouild say that such an appeal to such dependably iterated good luck not only would offend Ockham, but common sense as well. It smacks of superstition, to me. This word, 'stacking', although quite familiar to me, seems to used by you in a sense that to me is entirely unfamiliar. Could you outline your novel use of this word, and explain just exactly what it means in terms of DNA molecules and expressed organic traits? Is this just another way of re-stating the old Darwinian thesis tiny differences accumulate steadily over generations until one day you look around and discover that a great big difference/change occurred without Natural Selection having noticed? Or any real prompting from the environment. Just incessant 'change for change sake' owing to long periods of isolated self-replication? It is tautologous to say that a positive change in life form will lead to a positive gain in self-replication. Since all tautologies are truisms, I can hardly argue the point. However, I can argue that relative frequency, speed, efficiency, and specificity by which a change in life forms arise in relation to a novel environmental difference which makes that change 'positive', as opposed to neutral [ineffective] or negative [detrimental] can give reasonable grounds to awarding the accomplishment to some intentional agency rather than a great streak of amazing luck. Fine. I'll continue to assert that evolution is a process of organismic adaptation to random environmental change, and you can stop using the word 'adaptive', or any of its cognates, or synonyms, wrt evolution. Darwin must be rolling over in his grave, but he's dead, so that's his problem. And my problem with you, all along, is your incredibly cavalier attitude towards words and their true meanings. Reminds me very much, if you'll forgive my saying so, of just what Humpty Dumpty said to Alice in Lewis Carroll's satirical 'children's' book. Semantics refer to truth in word meanings, where two or more communicaters use the same terminology, what is 'true' for one must be 'true' for the other, or the word usage simply is not true at all. And, what Mr. Dumpty said notwithstanding, there is no legitimate way that one person, or select group of persons, can unilaterally and arbitrarily impose a new meaning on a word without the express consent of all others with whom they use that word in any act of communication, because when they do this, they speak falsely, deceptively, mendaciously, and do no more than corrupt meaning to serve their own purposes. Sounds like 'politics as usual' to me. This is a flagrant example of 'special pleading'. I can't remember the exact names of the logical fallacies it falls under. What special case?!? LIFE? Life was around long before language was invented. Which might be convincing if you could demonstrate it just as easily using other life forms. Another 'special case' for 'special pleading', it sounds like to me. Exceptions are not the foundations for the rule. Well, up to this moment, it has seemed to me that that is exactly what you were doing, in both cases. I appreciate the fact that if I wish to drink a glass of beer I need the beer, a hand an elbow, a throat and stomach, among other physical things. I also require thirst, taste, satisfaction, and a lot of other stuff that I would not have were I not also alive, and acting teleologically. Try telling that to a dead organism.","intelligent-designs-black-box","02:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","64"

"01-27-2009","12214",5,"Matthew","342010","Your mistake is to assume that adaptations require teleological explanations. For while Darwin did indeed believe that evolution is an adaptive process, his entire point was to account for adaptations without invoking final causes. And the need for such an account arises from the fact that adaptations do not appear in response to the needs of the species in which they might appear. Now, I do not doubt for one second that these birds wanted to survive and reproduce. I have no doubt that doing so was some sort of ""purpose"" or ""goal"" of theirs, perhaps even an ""intention"" or a ""drive."" But none of that caused them to adapt to the new predator in their midst. First, there was no final cause that compelled the birds to adapt. (And it's worth keeping in mind that real cases of successful adaptation get explained this way all the time, from the coloration of guppies in the presence or absence of predators to the pesticide resistance of insects.) What purpose is served by being hung up on the name of ""natural selection ?"" The process by which adaptations develop -- or fail to develop , incidentally -- can still be still be described ateleologically, and is in fact best described ateleologically. We could call it ""natural separation"" or even ""flurbation."" A rose by any other name. Why does using evolution as the subject of a sentence reify it? Truth matters to me, too, you know.","jakers","342070","Why is that a mistake, rather than an obvious fact? Perhaps, but in that, he failed. He did, perhaps, show that there are no ultimate final causes, and if he did, then quite possibly he was right, and there are no ultimate final causes. But he did nothing to prove the non-existence of proximate and temporal final causes, and if you believe, as I do, that evolution is a process by which solutions are found to proximate, temporal, problems relative to time and space, and not some ultimate, fundamental, elemental problem, then you cannot call anything adaptive that _is not_ looking for, teleologically seeking, that proximate solution to that immediate problem. Nor can you call anything that _is_ doing that, non-adaptive. And the problem with that is, that they do. Ask any infectious bacterium about antibiotic resistance. Nowhere is it claimed that any organism can adapt to any situation in which it finds its. Heck, the dodo and the dinosaur have already told us that much. But failure to solve to solve one problem or another is not proof that an intrinsic ability to solve some problems does not exist. It is certainly not proof that adaptation and evolution are matters of chance accident, lucky happenstance, a coincidental conjunction of genetic mutation and organismic need. It merely points up the reality that teleology is not magic. Some things it can fix, some things it can't. Lucky chance, however, seldom fixes anything, so if I'm putting money on a race, teleology versus luck, my money is always on teleology. Yes, there was--survival. They were compelled, but unable to comply. They could find no way to adapt to the snakes, just as the dodo could find no way to adapt to 18th century sailors, and so, they are gone. Just like 90% of all the species that ever walked the earth. Having a final cause, and failing to achieve it, are two different things. Just ask any would-be affluent child who had to drop out of medical school and take up truck driving. Beware the seductive rationalization posing as an honest and true explanation. If you think you can, then why don't you? Thise is not a case a case of 'a rose by any other name'. This is a case of two very different plants being called by a name that is only appropriate, legitimate, and true of one of them. It's not so much the reification as the anthropomorphization that botheres me, because in this instance using 'evolution' as the subject makes it out to be its own cause. Evolution is responsible for evolution. Evolution is what evolution does. And so on and so forth. That eliminates the need to find any real cause for evolution. I'm sure that it matters to all of us, or we wouldn't bother talking about ideas and reality, instead of playing video games and eating snacks. Speaking of which, I feel motivated, teleologically speaking, to go grab a bite.","intelligent-designs-black-box","04:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","66"

What is not obvious is what has caused that fact. And that's what I thought was at issue here: not whether organisms are adapted to their environments, but why. What's also not obvious (to me, at any rate) is what exactly you have in mind by speaking of ""teleology."" Perhaps an example will help. Must we invoke final causes to explain why, say, a polar bear is adapted to cold environments? (Or see the bacterium example below. But I'd like to see what you have to say about the polar bears, too.) But in the case of evolution, what exactly is doing this ""looking for?"" Or maybe not what, but who ? Sorry, but no. The mere fact that a given feature would be adaptive under given conditions does not cause that feature to appear. Sometimes, the bacteria all die. Which is quite fortunate for us when we take antibiotics! If, however, a genetic feature that allows a bacterium to resist antibiotics already exists or comes into existence, while its neighbors lack this feature, then that bacterium will leave more offspring in the next generation than its neighbors (other things being equal, of course). As will its offspring, relative to their neighbors. And so on and so on. I would say that, to construe antibiotic resistance as a telos that bacteria are trying to reach, somehow then ""causing"" the bacteria to evolve said antibiotic resistance, is to get things precisely backwards . Antibiotic resistance is a real effect , not an ideal cause. But conversely, successfully adapting does not show that teleology obtains, either. The above account can explain why bacteria develop antibiotic resistance when they do, and why they don't when they don't. It even explains why, in those cases where bacteria develop antibiotic resistance, there is usually a much higher kill rate at the beginning, after which the resistant strains build up their numbers. (The situation is essentially the same for pesticide resistance in insects.) What exactly does this account miss that only teleology can explain? And how does teleology explain it? You realize, though, that natural selection is not ""chance."" Right? ""Not teleological"" is not equivalent to ""chance."" But even granting your point for the sake of argument: Is there a principled distinction to be made between what teleology can fix and what it can't? If not, then what distinguishes teleological causation from lucky chance after all? In practice, how could we tell the difference? Okay, firstly-- now who's hypostasizing an abstraction! ""Survival"" is not a ""thing."" It doesn't do anything. I find it rather bizarre that, after all this criticism about evolutionists reifying ""evolution,"" you would do the same with ""survival."" But frankly, turning abstractions into things strikes me as a necessary component of teleology. Secondly, ""survival"" is entirely too general to explain anything specific . In the case of the vanished birds of Guam, what particular effects did ""survival"" have on them? If all that a teleological explanation can say is something like ""The organism's goal of survival led it to try to survive,"" I just don't find that terribly informative. Thirdly and finally, insofar as the birds did not survive, how did survival "" cause "" anything?!? Your medical student example doesn't help here. Having the goal isn't the cause of your would-be doctor's failure! And even if he were to succeed, having the goal wouldn't be the cause of his success. To sum up: I just don't see how final causes are causes. Indeed! And personally, I find ""final causes"" to be the most seductive of all such rationalizations; their seductiveness probably explains their vast historical success. Not so! In using the term ""selection,"" Darwin was making a useful analogy. As with all analogies, there is no claim of perfect resemblance. The obvious disanalogy is that when human breeders select, they do so consciously and intelligently, whereas the effects of natural ""selection"" are not conscious or intelligent. But a profound similarity is found in both cases: based on some feature or features of their own, some entities are systematically removed from the larger set of entitities to which they belong. So why not call it ""selection?""","intelligent-designs-black-box","08:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","68"

I stated that organisms have been observed to ""...change in response to their environment."" Actually, the organisms change as a consequence of changes in the genome of the population. The genome changes in response to the environment as well as other mechanisms of evolution. It doesn't matter how you'd define evolution. That's how biologists define it. If you don't like it, then you aren't talking about evolution. Maybe you should select another word for whatever you are talking about. People will get the impression that you are talking about evolution and that you know what you are talking about otherwise. But that's the definition used by biologists - a change in the allele frequency in a population over generations. You can talk about whatever you want but please stop calling it evolution. Evolutionary biologists are the ones who get to assign meanings to the terms that they use. What does that mean? Please define ""actual forms that express life."" What exactly is a ""head count"" of DNA molecules? I think a good name for whatever you are talking about would be ""nebulous fantasy."" That may be for someone who doesn't know what evolution is in the first place. Either you missed the point or you are being intentionally disingenuous. The point was (as Peeling said and with which I agreed) that diversity can accumulate in a population that is not a response to problems or opportunities in the environment. I mentioned that Darwin had made that observation. I said nothing about whether or not Darwin understood genetics. Try reading Darwin again. Or even any good book on evolution. I can recommend some if you would like to learn. [quote]And that is basically all that Darwin had to say about that, based upon his empirical observations.

For sure you don't understand the notion of alleles. That could be why you don't understand the notion of evolution, reproduction and genetics. No wonder you want to look for nebulous and undefined forms. Like I agreed, you don't understand.
