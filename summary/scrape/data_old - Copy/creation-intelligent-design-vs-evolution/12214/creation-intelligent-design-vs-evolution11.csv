Jakers, you have been (from the initial instance, I'm guessing) talking about a different version of 'evolution' from the rest of us. Evolution is not simply ""the creation of novel variation"", it is the method by which novel variation is created and retained . It's that retention part (natural selection and genetics) which favours 'positive' variation over 'negative' - natural selection 'chooses*' what variations survive and/or prosper and genetics is (largely) the mechanism by which variation is passed on. * Yes, that's telic language. To re-phrase, then, 'natural selection' is the name given to the tautology/fact/method that those organisms whose variation enables them to breed the most, end up breeding the most.","intelligent-designs-black-box","10:07 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","152"

And to do that we can't just brush contributing factors like RM under the carpet and pretend they don't exist or don't matter. We need to fully understand their contribution so that our understanding of everything else isn't grossly distorted.","jakers","344440","I'm not 'brushing random genetic mutation' under the carpet. Obviously, it happens, just like roadkill 'happens'. What I'm saying is that random genetic mutation, even were I to grant that it might, in a few anomalous cases, fortuitously contribute to some original and productive organismic property/trait, that would always be the exception, not the rule. You don't build scientific principles on anomalies and exceptions. Therefore the basic principle wrt the the fundamental agency/cause of evolution is not random, spontaneous generation of organismic changes via entropic system failure or external toxins, it is a telic process wherebye the organism itself makes itself, [and more importantly, its offspring], more adapted, fitted, suited to a particular environment than its predecessors were. In my hypothesis, the organism is not the hapless pawn of stochastically altered DNA molecules--rather, DNA molecules are the 'paper' on which the organism pro-actively re-writes its message to posterity as it engages with its environment. To simplify, your hypothesis [called a 'theory', although never tested empirically], is that information moves from accidentally altered molecule that by merely existing contains coded information that then is mechanically, deterministically, moved along a chemical developmental conveyor belt until at length a novel [at least in part] organismic trait appears. In my hypothesis, more of the Lamarckian style, information comes to the whole organism from the environment. The organism deals with this information in such a way as to further its own 'best interests'. If during the course of doing so, its behaviour patterns and trait functions change, then this new information is passed on to its offspring during the developmental process, enabling the offspring to use the parent's experience to better work with the information that the environment is supplying. If the same conditions persist over successive generations, more information is collected and expanded, both in terms of behaviour and, if necessary, physiology. Eventually this info 'hardens' and becomes mechasnised and systematic as the organism encodes it on DNA molecules in its genome. Your model; damaged gene->organism->environment->persistent mutant my model environment->organic adaptation-> coded gene->evolved organism Later.","intelligent-designs-black-box","11:42 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","153"
"02-26-2009","12214",11,"Peeling","344825","I think trying to respond line-by line would be somewhat impractical, especially when only one or two issues are at stake. I will instead try to summarise; let me know if I miss anything important. So we agree random mutation happens. I'm confident you would never argue that radiation or chemical mutagens can somehow 'avoid' causing mutations that later turn out to be pertinent, so it follows we agree radiation or chemical mutagens can and do induce such mutations. Yet according to you we can infer nothing from these facts because we are supposedly not allowed to explain a phenomenon via a mechanism which would only rarely and exceptionally generate it - even if that phenomenon is empirically rare and exceptional! Forgive me, but I cannot see merit in that reasoning. Whatever the explanation, it must necessarily only predict rare and exceptional 'success' within individual bacteria, or else it will not accord with our observations. So why is a rarely successful telic process a better explanation than a rarely pertinent natural process? Moreover, if random mutations can, as you say, in exceptional cases turn out to be pertinent, they necessarily account for at least some fraction of the observed occurrences of pertinent mutations.","jakers","345100","Hi; I think that that is a good idea, especially as something has come up that is really eating into the time I have available for fun chats and debates. You may be gettinmg veryshort, 'hit and run' messages for the next few weeks. I hope you won't find that irritating. Well, not exactly. Yes, random mutations and accidents do happen in this world. And yes, there is no question, as seen in many studies, that some random mutations can be ""pertinent"", if by that you mean 'non-trivial' where the 'life-style' of the expressed organism is concerned. In fact, often such mutations are downright lethal, and are very often, even usually, crippling. In that sense there is no denying that randomly arriving genetic mutations are ""pertinent"". But as to whether or not such stochastic accidents are in any way, ever positive [adaptively speaking] for the organism that expresses them;[ ie., experiences a trait change mechanically brought into existence by said genetic accident that coincidentally matches current and immediate needs and wants wrt survival, etc.], ""might do"" is as far as I am willing to go, since arguing what is opr is not possible in this world won't get us anywhere. However, that does not give you the right to change my ""might do"" to ""actually do"". There is a great difference between allowing possibility and affirming actuality. We can draw any inference we like from our observations, so long as they are plausible and ration. That's exactly how every hypothesis, including scientific hypotheses, begins. But in science, as in philosophy, an hypothesis is only a beginning. The hard part is proving that what you have inferred from observations to be the cause for a certain kind of event, is in fact the actual cause of that kind of observed effect, as a general rule and guiding principle. Which means, for L&D, etc., observations of survival patterns in large populations of related microbes in a given experiment is sufficiently plausible and rational to infer that that they were caused by some random agency, because, statistically speaking, the result patterns resemble what one would expect to see if one pre-supposed a non-mechanical, disordered, unguided and haphazardly acting causal factor of some kind, and you have already ruled out any kind of telic agency intrinsic to the organism itself having any influence in the causation of those random-looking result patterns. First of all, you are still thinking in the old, 'bacteria are single -celled organisms that end up clumping together in a certain spot as they increase their population totals'. As if each bacterium were a separate and distinct individual organism, and so to deal with such lifeforms, you must consider them, 'one at a time'. We now know that bacteria are in fact eusocial 'super-organisms', and that they must be dealt with 'one sizable colony/population at a time'. Thus, what is rare in single cells, is common, even the rule, in the eusocial 'superorganism'; a collectively self-serving intelligent entity. Whoa! I said 'might', meaning, 'possibly could';--- but in no way do I grant that they 'actually do', or ever 'have done', anything that is or was positively pertinent in terms of of expressed novel traits. I'm only saying that that is not impossible. I don't know if you are using 'pertinent' as a synonym for 'positive'; I know that I don't. It would seem to me that where where 'pertinent' applies to to a loss of 'adaptability/survivability', i.e., 'negative' outcomes, random genetic accidents have shown themselves to be a common cause. To say that because it has been observed that a fairly ubiquitous causal event [random genetic mutation] commonly results in very negative outcomes for the inheriting offspring, it follows that at least some times it must and actually does result in very positive outcomes as well. That's illogical. Perhaps it may, but there is no natural law compelling such positive outcomes out of randomly acting agents. 'Maybe, might, could do', is the very best that logic will allow. But darn, my spare time is used up again. Will get back to you as soon as I can.","intelligent-designs-black-box","05:52 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","162"

Right now I think the best candidate is the 'Might do' issue - but if you disagree, you can finish your previous response and we can work forward from there. Let's not forget, there's no requirement for a genetic change to match current and immediate needs or wants. It can be pertinent to a later environmental change. (NB: Since you ask, I'm using 'pertinent' for two reasons. Firstly, because you used it. Secondly, as we've established, I can't use 'adaptive' or any term that even whiffs of goal-oriented behaviour, so a mutation being 'pertinent' to self-replication is about the best I can come up with. If I could use 'positive', that would be a great help ) But let's consider this 'might do' you're limiting yourself to at the moment. The exact same kinds of mutation (insertion, deletion, frameshift, mis-sense etc) that negatively affect biological operation and replication - which you would I'm sure happily attribute to random external causes - also lie behind contextually (current environment) or eventually (later environment) positive changes to biological operation. A change to one base-pair that ultimately renders an organism non-viable is no different, in terms of the chemical changes involved, to the same change to an identical base-pair elsewhere in the genome that has a contextually or eventually positive effect. In other words, there's no reason whatsoever to treat contextually/eventually positive mutations as 'special'. Their effects may be wildly different, but in terms of what is changing and how at the molecular level they are indistinguishable. Since you've already accepted that random mutations do happen, and it is an empirical fact that there is no distinction between the 'kinds' of mutations that prove positive and those that prove negative, you have already effectively conceded that RM does encompass positive as well as negative change. But there is further confirmation: observations under elevated levels of environmental mutagens. What we see is a linear increase in the rate of all mutations, something that would not occur if contextually/eventually positive mutations were 'special'. It is not necessary to 'rule out' any kind of telic agency, because it is not and has never been an either/or scenario. Both RM and telic processes could in principle be in play. Based on our factual knowledge, RM's contribution to positive change is inevitable. The question therefore isn't 'Is RM or some telic process at work?', but 'Is something other than RM at work as well ?' All organisms are eusocial. All of them influence their neighbours in some fashion, and all form collectives (willingly, knowingly or otherwise) whose emergent behaviour is something beyond the sum of the parts. The swarming phase of locusts, for instance, emerges spontaneously through purely individualistic activity at a critical population density. The fact remains: mutations occur to individual organisms, in this case bacteria. Moreover, in experiments the 'broth' in which colonies are cultured prior to plating is continuously agitated, effectively eliminating any possibility of structured organisation. It would be like trying to hold a committee meeting in a tornado. Plus, recall the L&D results confirming that the occurrence of mutation within individuals is not related to population size. There is no evidence that mutation is a eusocial activity - and even if we did find some in the future, it wouldn't invalidate the contribution from RM. It would be layered on top. I completely agree, right up to the semicolon. After that we're into somewhat murky semantic waters. Even so, inevitable RM is perfectly adequate, all by itself, to explain how individually rare events become the rule in large populations. If some telic process is also at work in larger, 'more intelligent' colonies, we should see it added to the effects of RM. And so far we don't. I'm aware you've never said those words, but nevertheless you have cumulatively conceded points that add up to precisely that. You agree random mutation happens. You agree the observed effects of experiments are congruent with random external influences as a cause. You have provided no evidence to suggest that positively pertinent mutations are of a different nature, at the genetic level, to those you would readily admit are randomly, exogenously induced. It all adds up. I can't force you to do the math, but I have high hopes","intelligent-designs-black-box","07:24 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","163"

I've taken on some responsibilities that are chewing up every bit of my time, or so it seems. For a while my input may be sporadic, and I apologise for that. [ That's only true if every randomly generated genetic mutation means something from the moment of inception, but is not expressed, or, is expressed but is so trivial that it makes no impact on your ""Natural; Selection"", and yet remains within the genome, archived, ready and able to suddenly, and coincidentally, express itself in a robust and meaningful way just as environmental conditions suddenly and randomly become changed in such a way that its expression is both meaningful and positive in terms of your ""Natural Selection"". Are you saying that all 'accidental information' encoded into a genome by a random mutation remains with that genotype forever? And re-expresses itself repeatedly enough that it gets expressed when positive in terms of NS, when suddenly it creates a difference that makes a difference, but either is not expressed until needed, or is always expressed,but is always trivial [neutral] until the long arm of happy environmental coincidence turns it into a very robust ""good thing""? You can use positive wherever you can empirically demonstrate tha5 a/ a genetic mutation is spontaneously, randomly generated, AND that that particular mutation lead mechanically to the expression of an organic trait that proved positive to the receiving organism in terms of its survival and well-being. If all you are saying is that there is a noticeable relationship between a random mutation at the gene level and a corresponding trait change at the organic level, then unless you can demonstrate the conditions I've outlined, then perhaps, 'robust or trivial', or 'effective or neutral', might be easier to parse than 'pertinent'. What do you think? I know that this is your claim, dating back to Fisher, Haldane, and Wright in the 1930's and forward to date. And it is this claim that I am challenging, calling upon you for empirical evidence and testing via the famous ""Scientific Method"" in order to validate it and give it the merit of being a 'theory', instead of just remaining an hypothesis for almost 80 years [whiler undeservedly called a 'theory'] All you have to do is prove this contention using the scientific method. You'll have a problem doing that, as the past has proven time and again. First, you hae to demonstrate mechanical chemical determinism between DNA molecule and expressed trait, and second you have to show how a random accident can encode meaningful information in a genome. Then you have to show how the issues I raised earlier are resolved. I bet dollars to donuts that you won't be able to do that, since nobody else ever has. You are just taking an assumption based upon idological faith, and assuming it for a fact. Not a good thing. There is, on the contrary, every reason in the world, logically and empirically, to expect a difference between that which causes a beneficial outcome and that which causes a negative outcome, or even no outcome amenable to observation'. Different causes have different effects, and different effects signify a difference in causation. What is to be learned from this is that qalthough all random genetic mutations ""look-alike"", so to speak, they make no difference, positive or negative or neutral, unless they 'code' for an enzyme which, by your reasoning, must by mechanical determinism be expressed biochemically in a specific trait change. Sadly for that hypothesis, most genes don't 'code' for anything at all, and never express anything. So why do some genes express just the right thing at just the right time and place? Because biochemistry says they could do, might do, would do, do do, because ""at the molecular level they are all the same sort of thing--a DNA molecule. There is no logic to that, as the genome-mapping work has proven. There is ""something else"" between the cup and the lip, so top speak. Somethin non-genetic, i.e., not molecular or chemical, is there in the live organism, and it rules the DNA, the DNA does not rule it. Absolutely not, as above. Not so. As we know, hypermutation is a self-defence mechanism employed organismically, epigenetically. Of course if you bang on the roof of a car more often, you'll produce more dents [negative/neutral outcomes]. But the fact of epigenetic hypermutation makes any claim that hyper-mutating bacteria or whatever artificially is the root mechanically determined efficient causer of a demonstrably positive organic trait mutation, dubious in the extreme. Besides, how often, out there in the reaL worled, do huge doses of radiation or other mutagenic materials suddenly invade the organism's immediate environment, causing so much hypermutation that what appears to be a positive trait mutation [and I'd love to see some real examples!!] was actually spontaneously generated. From what I've read, the only 'positive' resultws arising from artificial hypermutation induced by hyper-radiation have been genetic genes arising that that express traits that counter and fight against the effects of hyper-radiation itself, so what does that tell you? I know what it tells me. Just what ""factual knowledge"" would that be.? With all due respect, I've seen nothing ""factual"" that proves anything coming out of your side in over 80 years!! Sorry, but that's my time. I promise to try to get back to you asap, and apologise in advance for any long delay.","intelligent-designs-black-box","01:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","164"

I think it likely you don't have clear examples of positive change in mind, which makes it difficult for you to imagine how a mutation could be neutral in one environment and positive in another. An example might be a mutation which causes the protein produced to be more structurally stable at higher temperatures, allowing biological function to continue should a warmer environment be encountered. Until altered by further mutation or eliminated by the failure of that lineage to breed, yes. Well, we'll get to the latter part presently, but as for the former, you've already agreed spontaneous random mutations do occur. You seem to be saying that they can occur to this base pair but not that one, yet you discriminate between this and that based - not upon the physics of the changes, but upon what the effect would be if they were changed. That's not logical. We cannot suppose mutagens tiptoe around the genome avoiding doing something you think they shouldn't. I really don't mind. I don't understand why you consider this a 'challenge'. Countless genes and genomes have been sequenced, to better understand all manner of positive or harmful mutations, and the changes involved are all of a relatively small variety of kinds. All the evidence is on my side here. You're claiming positive mutations are 'special', not just in terms of their effect but in terms of the actual chemical change to the genome. Where's your evidence? Easily enough done. The 'temperature stability' mutation example I spoke of earlier is a good one; I'll track it down for you if you like. Another is the nylon-bug mutation: the altered protein (nylonase) acts as a chemical catalyst for the breakdown of certain nylon waste products. Then there's gene-splicing: if a gene were, as you prefer, merely a 'note to self' for the organism that had 'invented' an organismic response, that note would invariably be meaningless to another organism. Such is not the case. Take the mutation that produced the nylonase enzyme, for instance - if that occurred (which it undoubtedly did billions of times) before the invention of nylon, would you say it required 'meaningful information' to be encoded in the genome at the time? Clearly not; it would pertain to nothing. Yet when someone invents nylon, that exact same mutation becomes 'meaningful' - so it's suddenly off-limits to arising via random mutation? I don't think so. Information, as I've said before, is a tricky and often counter-intuitive subject, mathematically speaking. Creating a new gene does not require the creation of any additional information; it is merely new data. A meteorite hits the Pope; a meteorite hits Hitler. Different effects, equivalent causation. Find yourself a see-saw, and get two friends to sit on one side of it near the pivot. Sit on the other side of the pivot and see what happens. Now move so you're sitting on the end instead of near the middle. Different effects, equivalent causation. I could go on, and on, and on, but you get the general idea. Yes, different effects have different causes. And the 'same' genetic change to two different base pairs counts as different causes: alike in nature but different in context. Enzyme coding is deterministic. The DNA isn't the 'name' of the enzyme. It's a direct mapping of triplets to amino acids. So what? Their effect can still be deterministic in a given context, as gene splicing demonstrates. Why would hypermutation be a sensible defensive response to elevated mutation rates? It tells me you stopped reading when you found something you liked Like I said, radiation is *routinely* used to increase genome-wide mutation rates to facilitate all manner of experiments. It's not news any more. Responses to UV bombardment are.","intelligent-designs-black-box","12:46 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","165"
