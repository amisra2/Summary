"01-26-2009","12214",4,"jakers","341663","More semantic gamesmanship!! It's getting awfully old, Peeling. (The 'best' self-replicator is an objective, quantitative measurement of fact.) No, it most certainly is no such thing, and in fact it is often a lethal mistake to think so. The ""best self-replicator"" in darwinian terms, 'fitness' and all that, is simply that entity which produces the highest number of replications of itself. The intrinsic value judgment assumed here is that of, ""more is better"". Except that, in many cases, 'more' is 'worse'. Much worse. One of the worst things that can happen to a species, and all of the other species in its ecosystem, is that it overpopulates. Causing the entire system, including itself, to crash and burn.","Peeling","341796","Believe me, I'd much rather not have that kind of discussion. As I said right at the start it's time I've wasted in the past and I don't want to do it again. And I certainly don't want to waste more time arguing over whose fault it has been. Readers can decide that much for themselves, but for what it's worth I apologise for everything I've done to aggravate matters. So I propose a relatively clean slate, and that we proceed more slowly and carefully, covering less ground with each post so as to keep it more manageable. Before it can be worth us discussing the original post in any detail, I think we need to achieve a meeting of minds on a couple of issues: 1. The 'feedback effect' of self-replication-with-variation in an environment of limited resources 2. Undirected random mutation and its implications for organismic fitness. The first issue is one that has proved especially problematic because apparently the word 'feedback' implies teleology. I think this is a case of semantics and objective truth being at odds, and I will endeavour to explain why. Suppose a telic agent were to decide to improve a set of self-replicators. Suppose he were to decide to do so by randomly varying the properties of existing self-replicators, measuring how copiously each variant replicated, clearing the slate and then seeding a new generation with variants in relative quantities derived from his measurements. He does this so that the rare changes that improve self-replication have a greater chance of stacking and accumulating with previous improvements. I'm sure you would happily acknowledge this clever teleological process as employing 'feedback'. Now suppose that the environment is such that the random variations to the properties of the replicators were inevitable. One contribution of the telic agent is thus rendered redundant. Next suppose that the telic agent, instead of clearing the slate and reseeding it with a new generation based on his measurements, simply allows the results of the previous generation to stand. In terms of the replicators themselves, and the numbers of each variant present in each successive generation, nothing has changed. That's the point: nothing has changed. The telic agent is now not doing anything, and the process still has the same effect. So if it has suddenly ceased to be a feedback process, it's for semantic reasons only (no telic agent involved). The 'best' self-replicators are no longer being 'selected' or 'preserved' and the worst no longer being 'rejected', but in terms of their changing numbers from generation to generation, the departure of the telic agent has had no effect . Now, I'm personally quite happy calling this a feedback process, both because of the effect it has and how that effect comes about. If you feel obliged to balk at the prospect, then we need to find an innocuous term we're both happy with, because the process and its effects are logically sound. NB: I'm aware the effect of this process depends upon the possibility of the 'random changes', be they induced by the telic agent or by the environment, increasing the relative quantity of a given self-replicator present in the next generation. Hence the second vital issue, 2) above, which I'll get to when we're done with 1). For now, the important point for us to agree upon is that the presence or absence of a telic agent in the process does not alter its effect on replication efficiency. Also, in case you're concerned that I might be trying to sneak some other prerequisite for evolution in under the radar: no, you've read the above correctly. Differential reproductive rates influence the chances of beneficial changes accumulating within individual organisms - that's all. So if you can agree with that, we can move on in joyous lockstep Edit: I just noticed something from your previous post that needs to be addressed here: This is wrong. I have to dash home now, but I'll pop back on in a bit and explain why. Bear with me until then.","intelligent-designs-black-box","12:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","52"

Now, as to the language issue: Here I am reminded of Nietzsche's famous quip that it might be impossible to get rid of God without also getting rid of grammar. Let me put it a little less obtusely (perhaps very little less). Is there something dishonest about speaking of sunrises and sunsets?

""Evolution"" doesn't get reified just because it gets used as the GRAMMATICAL subject of a sentence!

"01-26-2009","12214",4,"Peeling","341849","Edit: Just saw this: Here's the problem with that: the article I originally presented speaks to an argument for ID made by advocates who understand the fundamentals of evolutionary theory as applied to genetics and for the most part accept the logic and bountiful evidence that undirected evolutionary processes can result in increases in fitness. You think evolution must be telic for a much simpler reason: because you can't see how an ateleological process could have any effect at all. So either we sort that misconception out first, or we agree not to bother. If you are interested in continuing on that basis, post #52 is probably the best starting point. All I show there is that differential reproductive rates inevitably increase the chances of replication-improving changes stacking with earlier ones - regardless of how those changes originate.","jakers","341911","I don't know from "" the logic and bountiful evidence that undirected evolutionary processes can result in increases in fitness"" since that's an empty boast attached to nebulous language, signifying nothing.

And I've made my position clear, and offered to drop out of your thread if it is incompatible with your purposes, on several occasions. You have failed to demonstrate that mechanical determinism plus random chance can, by and of themselves alone, drive life forms to diversify and vary over generations,-- the process we, [or at least, I], call biological evolution. I doubt very much that any ID supporters, anywhere, are convinced that you have done so. What you call ""that misconception"" has been a part of my argument from the start. If you wish to prove that ateleological events, be they random/accidental and/or chemically determined, can lead to population fluctuations, I'm not interested. Anything can lead to population fluctuations. Population fluctuations are not evolution; not unless you are talking about the evolution of whole ecosystems, rather than about the evolution of distinct and separate life forms. I prefer to remain empirical. Your, ""differential reproductive rates inevitably increase the chances of replication-improving changes stacking with earlier ones"" sounds purely theoretical, highly abstract, and a bit like wishful thinking. Let me ask you this question. Do you think that evolution is about adaptation to external events? If you do, how can you say that 'adaptation' is not intrinsically and inescapably teleological? How can you have an ateleological but adaptive process, of any kind? If you deny teleology, you deny the role of adaptation in evolutionary biology. Are you willing to do that?

I couldn't agree more. So when, for instance, a mutation in bacterial DNA is demonstrably both necessary and sufficient for a replication-improving trait to manifest, when the chemical activity of the novel enzyme (for instance) deterministically generated from that DNA can be traced to its effect upon organismic fitness, and the mutation demonstrably arises stochastically prior to the bacterium encountering the environment in which the mutation improves replication, it would violate Ockham's Razor to suppose the existence of some unknown teleological mechanism at work, based solely on an a priori philosophical assumption that only teleological processes can increase the replication chances of complex systems. Simpler by far to acknowledge the sufficiency of what we see before us to explain the phenomenon, and discard the erroneous philosophical assumption. Then you doubt wrongly. Both Behe and Dembski, to name only two, have accepted the validity of known evolutionary mechanisms - they just believe them to be insufficient to explain all biological features. Hence their statistical approach to inferring design. As for me having failed to demonstrate the effect of evolutionary mechanisms - in fairness we've only just reached the point of me starting to try As I said, the OP assumed a certain level of understanding, from which point we've been working steadily backwards in an attempt to find some common ground. Well, yes, that's what I just said. Which is why it would be a waste of time to discuss the OP right now. Its merits are only worth discussing if you don't believe the issue has already been settled by some other argument. Population fluctuations in absolute terms can, as you say, occur for many reasons. But fluctuations in the relative proportions of variants comprising that population are influenced by what you would call the relative 'fitness' of those variants in their environment. And those fluctuations in turn inevitably influence the relative chances of future changes stacking with the different variants already in existence. If there are a lot of variant A and only a few of variant B, the chances of a later change stacking with A is much greater than that of it stacking with B. Why is this relevant to the evolution of distinct and separate life forms? Because what separates two species that share an ancestor species are the differences in their accumulated changes. The longer two populations of a single species are reproductively isolated from one another, the more different the 'stacks' of changes in each population become - and this is true regardless of whether you believe the changes themselves are random or telic in origin. Part of that can result from genuinely different changes arising within each population, but even if the exact same changes were to arise in both populations, in the same order, the two populations can still diverge because DRR in their respective environments would influence which changes accumulated with which others. If a million men called Steve and one man called Andy enter the lottery, is it more likely a Steve or an Andy will win? Do we need to conduct that experiment for real to find out? So if a change - random or telic - empirically improves the relative statistical chance of self-replication, that mutant will inevitably come to numerically dominate the population. Agreed? So when another change occurs to an organism - again, be it random or telic - to which variant is it more likely to occur? The numerically dominant mutants, or the minority non-mutants? If you take the position that 'adaptive' implies teleology by definition, then obviously an ateleological but adaptive process is a semantic contradiction. It doesn't stop a process of ateleological self-replication improvement occurring, it just means we can't call it adaptive. Now personally , I'm comfortable with saying 'ateleological adaptation', because to me that describes something that has the same effect as adaptation, but isn't telic. Since semantics do not define objective truth, I don't see why putting those two words together should make me automatically wrong. 'Ateleological' is just a qualifier. The same goes for 'natural selection', a phrase chosen at the time for the express purpose of leading the reader from a concept they're comfortable and familiar with (livestock breeding) and showing them how the rigours of the environment result in an analogous effect , even if the actual process lacks the telic qualities implied by 'selection'. There was never any intent or desire to sneak animism in through the back door, as you seem determined to believe. As I've said all along, self-replication with variation is an utterly unique special case, the only situation in which statistically rare improvements can accumulate, and statistically common neutral or deleterious changes abate, without the interference of a telic entity. It's hardly surprising that it's difficult to find appropriate words, when the words we have were defined in ignorance of that one special case. Well, I don't know what 'many supporters' think. I know there is much, much more to evolution than mutation and differential reproductive rates. There are two reasons I focus on those elements here and now. First, their combined effectiveness is relatively straightforward to demonstrate, using asexually reproducing bacteria. Second, before I could even hope to interest you in the more complex processes entailed by sexual reproduction, I have to break down the mental block you have against the principle of ateleological processes yielding improved self-replication. I neither deny teleology per se, nor do I claim adaptation has no role in evolutionary biology. What I'm saying is that whatever effect they have it is inevitably layered atop known ateleological effects. Do you appreciate the distinction? Ateleological processes that improve an organism's fitness will continue to blindly operate regardless of whether or not the organism itself is telic. There is no all or nothing dichotomy.","intelligent-designs-black-box","07:38 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","59"

For while Darwin did indeed believe that evolution is an adaptive process, his entire point was to account for adaptations without invoking final causes. And the need for such an account arises from the fact that adaptations do not appear in response to the needs of the species in which they might appear. Consider the case of Guam. A venomous bird-eating tree snake was introduced there sometime around the end of World War II or shortly thereafter. The island's birds had never seen such a predator: prior to its arrival, there were no snakes on Guam. The effect was quite predictable. The snakes found easy pickings, and within a few decades there were no birds left on the island. Some had gone extinct; the others survived only because people removed them from the island altogether for conservation purposes. Now, I do not doubt for one second that these birds wanted to survive and reproduce. I have no doubt that doing so was some sort of ""purpose"" or ""goal"" of theirs, perhaps even an ""intention"" or a ""drive."" But none of that caused them to adapt to the new predator in their midst. On the other hand, it is quite easy to envision a process whereby that could have happened. If any of the birds possessed some feature that enabled them to defend themselves against the snake -- whether that feature pre-existed the snake's arrival or emerged soon after it arrived -- these birds simply would tend to survive and reproduce more effectively than their neighbors. And if that feature were heritable, they would pass it on to at least some of their offspring, who would follow in their parents' footsteps to survive and reproduce more effectively than their neighbors (perhaps even some of their siblings). And so on and so on, until you would wind up with the birds left on Guam adapted to the snake. But of course, that story is counterfactual. It's premised on one big ""if."" And as it turns out, the requisite conditions never got met. The important point to note is twofold. First, there was no final cause that compelled the birds to adapt. Second, their actual decline can be explained, and their hypothetical success could be explained, without resorting to any final causes. (And it's worth keeping in mind that real cases of successful adaptation get explained this way all the time, from the coloration of guppies in the presence or absence of predators to the pesticide resistance of insects.) What purpose is served by being hung up on the name of ""natural selection ?"" The process by which adaptations develop -- or fail to develop , incidentally -- can still be still be described ateleologically, and is in fact best described ateleologically. We could call it ""natural separation"" or even ""flurbation."" A rose by any other name. And I think that sometimes what ""appears to be"" and ""reality"" are not necessarily the same. Which is why I used the examples of sunrise and sunset. The sun appears to move across the sky, and it's hardly dishonest to say so. But that's not what's really going on. I'm sorry you feel that way. I think it's a marvelously simplified example of how mechanistic processes can lead to the numerical dominance of some entitities over others under particular conditions. Where? What is it that we can't understand here without invoking final causes? Why? I presume that you don't disagree about the sunrise/sunset issue (though I could be wrong). Why does using evolution as the subject of a sentence reify it? Truth matters to me, too, you know. And I think the truth of the matter is, adaptations can be explained without invoking final causes!
