A different take, but captures the concept of one utterly unable to look at one's own behavior.","Kronus","292194","See, that's the nuance I'm trying to capture. He was so perfectly describing himself, but in such a deragatory tone. Mere irony doesn't do it justice.","aggressive-evolutionists-abandon-logic-intelligent-design-evolution-debate","08:26 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","31"

I guess it's the irony aspect that's got me here, not the hypocisy. The fact that he was so perfectly, yet apparently blindly, describing and denouncing his own behavior.","aggressive-evolutionists-abandon-logic-intelligent-design-evolution-debate","07:53 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","33"
"12-05-2007","10648",3,"None","None","None","PoliticalRef","292833","The answer to the questions I've asked is simply that there is no provable answer. We all agree on that. Logically speaking, considering the fact that we're all going to die, should we not look into improvable theories of ultimate existence that address some of these questions. It is logical to assume that God exists. It is logical to assume that we are intelligently designed. Neither of these assumptions are provable. I love science because it aids our understanding of many things and helps us in innumerable ways. Science does not give us definitive answers on the ultimate questions. This is where philosophy comes in. As for why I read motivations into the article, the answer is simple. Doing this is provocative and inspires debate as I think all of the replies demonstrate. I agree that it is unfair to the author, but I'm sure the author would appreciate the debate.

Perhaps, but it does not mean we assume one to be truer just because we want it to be. No it isn't. There is no evidence for God. It is logical to assume unicorns exist? On the other hand, merely because there is no evidence does not mean God does not exist. It is logical to be agnostic about God's existence. Any other position is illogical. No it is not logical to assume we are intelligently designed. Your argument is nothing more then ignorance = Goddidit. You never refuted that. You never even tried to. Except you have completely failed to educate yourself about the most basics of science, particularly how it operates. But philosophy is a art without evidence and measurable proof. More like pointless.","aggressive-evolutionists-abandon-logic-intelligent-design-evolution-debate","12:02 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","35"

If complex things require intelligent designers, then intelligent designers also require intelligent designers by dint of being complex (unless you can conceive of a non-complex designer). The only way to avoid the infinite regress is to assume that complex things don't require an intelligent designer. Speaking as a certificated philosopher I can't think of a single 'ultimate question' that philosophy has answered. Theology is worse. It answers questions about nothing at all.","aggressive-evolutionists-abandon-logic-intelligent-design-evolution-debate","07:43 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","39"
"12-07-2007","10648",3,"None","None","None","Symbiote","292959","I tend to think of philosophy at its best as a kind of meta-science, it provides or at least suggests the axioms that ground both natural sciences (ie empiricism) and theoretical sciences (eg mathematics, economics, natural law). It doesn't solve the problems, but it frames the questions and creates the rules about what constitutes a meaningful answer, which is half the battle. Perhaps sadly much contemporary philosophy isn't looking at these kind of questions, which often aren't very glamorous, but prefers to in the words of Marx, not understand the world, but change it. A tenureship is often just a way to try and push an ideology, or a ####### match over the correct interpretation of a historically famous writer, where success and glory are little attracted to the merits of ideas in their own right, more concentrated around those that the political establishment can use to achieve their ends.
