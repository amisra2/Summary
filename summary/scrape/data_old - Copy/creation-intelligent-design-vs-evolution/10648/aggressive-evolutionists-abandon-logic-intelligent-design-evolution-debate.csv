The chimpanzee shares 98% of the DNA of humans yet they are demonstrably a lower animal with nothing in common to humanity creatively or intellectually. CHICAGO Observed in the wild and tested in captivity, chimpanzees invite comparison with humans, their close relatives. They bear a family resemblance that fascinates people, and scientists see increasing evidence of similarities in chimp behavior and skills, making some of them think on the vagaries of evolution. For some time, paleontologists and evolutionary biologists have known that chimp ancestors were the last line of todays apes to diverge from the branch that led to humans, probably six million, maybe four million years ago. More recent examination shows that despite profound differences in the two species, just a 1.23 percent difference in their genes separates Homo sapiens from chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes. And certain similarities between the two species, scientists say, go beyond expressive faces and opposable thumbs. Chimps display a remarkable range of behavior and talent. They make and use simple tools, hunt in groups and engage in aggressive, violent acts. They are social creatures that appear to be capable of empathy, altruism, self-awareness, cooperation in problem solving and learning through example and experience. Chimps even outperform humans in some memory tasks. They have no imagination or sense of reason that allows them to create as we do so easily.

Therefore I realize that simply because we do not know does not equate to Goddidit. Artur C. Clark once wrote that ""any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" That can easily apply to the natural world. What we believe to be unexplainable only is that way because we have not advanced to the stage where we can explain it. The earliest religion, Animism attributed things like rain, sun and lightning to Gods because they were at a loss to explain the natural world. Those natural occurrences were too complex for them to understand at their developed level. ID is in principle no different. And ID is clearly hiding that their so called intelligent Designer is the Christian God. No religious group other then evangelical Christians have jumped on board in numbers and in funds. The Discovery Institute is funded by Evanglical Christians. Force. Which we know is not intelligent. It can be controlled by intelligent forces but it itself is not intelligent. So? You're displaying the very rational as Animists. ID can be summed up in one phrase: Stuff Complex, Therefore God. If you accept ID, you must accept Animist, or you are a hypocrite. Again, you are guilty of what you accuse others of. Cells did not come by what they are today by 'random' chance. While it is true that mutations are indeed random, the selection of genes and thereby allele frequencies is dictated by a wide variety of factors, few if any are random. Only when you do not understand evolution. For one who is guilty of what he accuses others of, I'm not surprised. What do you mean how we got here? Evolution explains how life grew from primitive single celled organisms into complex multi-celled organisms. That alone explains how we got here. If you're looking for a theory of everything, that's a interdisciplinary study of various sciences, psychology and cultural studies. But mankind is very far from a single unifying theory. I have no idea what you mean by ""how we got here."" That's abiogenesis. Not evolution.

No. ID proposes a ""hypothesis,"" but no testing, no theory, no description of nature, no avenue for expanding knowledge. It says, ""Ah, we can't figure it out, therefore we'll quit trying.""

Structures that fit the definition of ""IC"" have had their evolutionary pathways derived. Dembski has admitted that SC just relies upon IC.

On the other hand, merely because there is no evidence does not mean God does not exist. It is logical to be agnostic about God's existence. Any other position is illogical. No it is not logical to assume we are intelligently designed. Your argument is nothing more then ignorance = Goddidit. You never refuted that. You never even tried to.

If complex things require intelligent designers, then intelligent designers also require intelligent designers by dint of being complex (unless you can conceive of a non-complex designer). The only way to avoid the infinite regress is to assume that complex things don't require an intelligent designer.

It doesn't solve the problems, but it frames the questions and creates the rules about what constitutes a meaningful answer, which is half the battle. Perhaps sadly much contemporary philosophy isn't looking at these kind of questions, which often aren't very glamorous, but prefers to in the words of Marx, not understand the world, but change it. A tenureship is often just a way to try and push an ideology, or a ####### match over the correct interpretation of a historically famous writer, where success and glory are little attracted to the merits of ideas in their own right, more concentrated around those that the political establishment can use to achieve their ends.
