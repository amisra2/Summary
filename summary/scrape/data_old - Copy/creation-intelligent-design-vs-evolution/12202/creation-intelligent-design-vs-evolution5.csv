"01-14-2009","12202",5,"Matthew","340242","Because I don't think the Bible needs defending. If that's the way Pandion feels about the matter, I don't think I'm going to succeed in arguing him out of it. It would be like trying to convince someone he that ought to like pecan pie, or that Dostoevsky is the greatest of all novelists. If there are specific passages at issue, I'm happy to discuss them. But I don't see any point in global characterizations of the Bible as meaningful or meaningless. What it needs is not a defense, but careful scrutiny and rigorous analysis. In the meantime, Pandion can buy a box full of Bibles and burn it under an inverted cross for all I care. How would that affect my life or my faith?","Archangel","340254","What's so sad about this is that in your mind, you're taking the high road.

"01-15-2009","12202",5,"gansao","340200","Modern science asks us to believe that the whole universe was once smaller than pinhead..so small in fact that it had no measurable size! It also asks us to believe that the universe is as it is purely by luck!","subaru","340298","Your short posting demonstrates how completely ignorant you are of the most elementary aspects of Science! First, the verb ""believe"" is not within the lexicon of science. Science asks us to ""believe"" nothing. The present available evidence shows a remarkable unity in indicating that a ""Big Bang"" of some sort lies at the beginning of the observable universe. However, there is an army of extremely gifted thinkers who have explored every alternative hypothesis of which they are able to conceive, in order to explain the observable facts. That so little success has attended their efforts is, in itself, impressive. It is impossible that Science asks us to believe that the universe is as it is by luck, since there is is no generally agreed-upon definition of the word ""luck."" A fortiori , there are no hypothetical mechanisms which would make sense of such a conception. (But see the astounding revelations below, especially postings #5, #6, and #9): http://www.4forums.com/political/wor...lings-1-a.html Perhaps your mental processes might approach some coherent form if you did some research on the concepts: ""chance,"" or ""statistical paradigms."" And don't forget quantum mechanics. Probability takes on quite a counter-intuitive form when probability values range over the complex plane, rather than merely over the positive real numbers. -","global-conspiracy-scientists","03:32 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","63"

How would that affect my life or my faith?","pandion","340369","It wouldn't. And that just ignores my point. I could care less what anyone believes about the Bible. Some may even find it useless. But it does contain the mythology of bronze age nomadic herdsmen. There is no doubt of that. When that mythology is presented as evidence in a discussion of science then it is irrelevant and meaningless. By the way, I don't burn books. Neither do I spend my money on Bibles. I have one that has been in my family for some years and I find that it is quite sufficient for any Bible reading that I want to do. I read it all once in English and major portions of it in two other languages. That's about all the Bible reading I need.","global-conspiracy-scientists","04:07 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","66"

But how self righteous are you to think you're God? Or is that just another symptom of your identity crisis. Every time you touch your keyboard you reveal your spiritual ignorance, and hypocrisy I might add. Your ignorance because you think my name is an expression of self righteousness since all Angels, even Archangels are servants of men, not above them in any way. And hypocritical since you just referred to yourself as God in the paragraph above. Also, I don't promote my notions of right and wrong since they're probably as reprobate as yours are. I promote and defend the scriptural principles of a perfect and Holy God whom I'm not worthy of being redeemed by. So I humbly follow and submit myself to Him. Sorry you find that so offensive. Thanks for the warning kid, but you should know that there is no such thing as purgatory. I'd be worrying about some place hotter if I was you. Thanks for the correction. I type fast and used the wrong word. I'm glad you got the point though and the message was clear.","global-conspiracy-scientists","06:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","69"
"01-16-2009","12202",5,"tester","340447","Archangel, Thanks for your reply (1st excerpt quoted below) to my inquiry (post #55 in this thread). I also just saw another post of yours that you recently referenced (2nd quoted excerpt below), and find your ethnic heritage and religious background, given your current religious beliefs, to be quite fascinating. Apparently I had preconceptions about you (i.e., of European descent and childhood in a Christian household) that had no basis in reality. Don't get me wrong: I don't associate anything positive or negative about either scenario... I'm just struck by how far off my preconceptions have turned out to be (I suppose there's a famous adage about making assumptions for a reason!) Finally, although I've been quite critical of some of your posts, I've got to give credit where credit is due; your latest post in this thread (#69, in response to ""God"") had me laughing out loud!","Archangel","340471","Thanks for your thoughtful response Tester. I will only say in addition to my previous posts that I fought my conversion to Christianity and acceptance of Christ for 2 years after I was feeling convicted by the Holy Spirit of who Jesus is. This was the most difficult single decision I ever made in my life, and the most important as it is for everyone who accept Jesus as their Lord and Savior. I was never raised to accept Jesus, talked into it, or ordered by anyone to believe as I do. Salvation, true salvation only comes by freely submitting ones will to our perfect and Holy God. Everything I represent here on this forum is based on what His word represents and is not of my own beliefs in any way. Although I adopt His values and principles as my own, I claim no special worthiness or superiority as His child because I realize it's by grace that I was saved as a sinner who was in dire need of that forgiveness, and not because I hold myself up as a good, self righteous or worthy person at all. That's about all bitter people like this subaru are good for. A touch of comedy relief. I'm glad you enjoyed it.","global-conspiracy-scientists","12:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","71"
"01-16-2009","12202",5,"marc9000","340145","You make a very good case in this particular application. Evolution couldn't attain the heights it has in science and philosophy without a few cases like this. The question is, how do we keep individual scientists opinions from claiming a direct relevance to evolution even when there may not be? The answer is, we cant and we arent, hence all the logical proof that atheism is taking over science. Now I know that claim inspires me to be mocked the opening post of this thread strongly hinted of mocking. It usually does, when the word conspiracy is used. Sure it did they were basic, but they were there. From one Amazon review... Christopher Reeve, Michael J. Fox, Dustin Hoffman, Brad Pitt campaigning for billions while Californias economy is an absolute train wreck. Evolutionary biology had plenty of connection with values. California has a lot more crumbling freeways and schools because of these particular Hollywood values. Like the scientific community, the Hollywood community has a distinct difference in values with that of the general public, even in California. Evolution/science claims to be so beneficial to life in the US - we have thousands of new prescription and OTC drugs that were unheard of only a few decades ago, it's a multi billion dollar industry. Are people in the US all that much more healthy and happy than they were a few decades ago because of these drugs?... We havent' built a new oil refinery in the US in 33 years - could the US possibly be better off with a few more oil refineries and a few less drugs? Would our national debt be just a little lower? Michael Ruse is one of the few atheists who analyzes the creation/evolution controversy while usually trying not to let his own personal views taint his observations. But I guess my respect for him just went down a notch Richard Lewontin is an evolutionist!! How can he say he opposes Darwinism? I brough up Spencer as just one example of many - others were Auguste Comte, James Frazer, Edward Tyler, Thomas Huxley, many others - who used what they believed to be a scientific backing to re-evaluate traditional religious doctrine in how societies and individuals should behaviorally function.[boldface added by Matthew] Most [Spencer-types] from Darwin's time to today, had theories that did vary, but they all used evolutionary concepts related to the gradual rise of man from some ape-like ancestor .","Matthew","340474","In the interests of time, I'm going to trim this response down a bit. I hope that won't seem too much of a cop-out! But I think some interesting issues can be focused well enough that there won't be much lost. I. Thanks! And indeed it couldn't. The thing is, these sorts of cases are not so ""few"" as you might think! II. Well, first off, let me say that it was not my intention to mock you! I can certainly be blunt and combative, and sometimes I will tease. But I have no desire to mock you. I am sorry for coming off that way. But I should also say that I don't set much store by the idea that atheism is taking over science. One doesn't have to be an atheist to be a good scientist or get one's work accepted by the scientific community. It's just that one doesn't have to be a theist for these things, either. Which is as it should be. We all live in the same empirically observable natural world. It shouldn't matter whether one is Catholic or Protestant, Jewish or Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist, atheist or agnostic: the science is the same for all of us. As for the specifics of the explanation you cited, I guess I think it takes more than a ""flow of events"" for a ""conspiracy."" Industrialization involved a ""flow of events,"" and not everyone was happy about them. But it wasn't a ""conspiracy."" (And even Marx didn't think so!) What we need are an identifiable set of real, particular conspirators who intend to control, and who do in fact control, the scientific community in order to bring about a desired end. And that's what we don't have yet. III. With this, we're into the book you had recommended. If you need to go back and look at your post again (or mine), or if you need to go to Amazon to look at the review you cited or the excerpt from the book, then take a sec and do so. But I think it's pretty clear when one looks at all of this: there is no specific connection being drawn between evolution and these moral problems. Sure, such a connection is claimed . But where's the evidence ? Perhaps it's out there, I'm not going to rule out the possibility. But the arguments so far provided don't connect evolution to these problems. For good measure, look at the following paragraph of yours: Fair enough. But what does evolutionary biology have to do with all these things? You can't just drop in a sentence saying that it's connected with value among comments about hypocritical actors and California crumbling and have done with it! Or the following: Probably not! But how would that imply anything about whether evolution is good science? You continue: Quite possibly! But what does it have to do with evolution? As I said at the outset, I think you're running a lot of ideas together here, without making a careful analysis. When it comes to issues of morality and policy, neither evolution in particular nor science in general can't tell us what we ought to do. They can tell us how things work, and that's it. Science could tell you what the effects of abortion are, but it doesn't say when you ""should"" have one -- if ever. Science can explain what happens when you drill for oil, but it doesn't tell you whether you ""ought"" to drill or not. This is what I meant in invoking the is-ought to distinction. III.A. Because Lewontin has always thought that adaptation and natural selection are overestimated, and he has nothing but scorn for applying Darwinism to human beings. My point is simply that you can't go from Darwinian evolution to values. Some conservatives think it gives you a leftist nightmare. Some liberals think it gives you a right-wing nightmare. Obviously, they can't both be right, at least not in any general sense. The reality is always more complicated than that. IV. True enough, and I don't mean to deny it! But the question is, is the scientific backing they believed they possessed really something they had? I think in the case of Spencer, the answer is no. He didn't even care for natural selection, because he recognized -- as did Darwin -- that it doesn't necessitate absolute progress, only relative progress. Despite coining the phrase ""survival of the fittest"" for Darwin, Spencer's view of evolution was progressivist and Lamarckian to the core. So I don't think it is at all accurate to treat Darwin's work as if it grounds or implies Spencer's. Needless to say, this applies a fortiori to contemporary evolutionary biology. Ruse has done some interesting work on this, separating out the metaphysical and value-laden philosophies of evolution (including that held by Darwin himself) from the empirical and value-neutral science of evolution (derived from Darwin's scientific work and refined for over a century now). Sure! But how does that show that there's some intrinsic, logical connection between evolution and Spencer's laissez-faire capitalism or other social theories? It simply doesn't, which is exactly why Wallace could be a socialist and Gould could be a Marxist. (I hasten to add that it would be just as gross a mistake to think that evolution justifies socialism, too.)","global-conspiracy-scientists","01:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","72"

Namely: The sentence quoted above is exactly the point of our disagreement. For I think you represent only what you believe God's word represents, and that is impossible for anyone to get around that limitation. Now, I don't for one second deny that, as you see it, what you say is what God represents. No doubt you have good reasons for thinking so, based on your personal experience. But the rest of us don't have access to your personal experience! So here's my question: Why should anyone else believe that what you say is God's word, rather than your interpretation of God's word?
