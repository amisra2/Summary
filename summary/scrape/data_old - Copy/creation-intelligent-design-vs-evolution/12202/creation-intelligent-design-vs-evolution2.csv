"01-12-2009","12202",2,"marc9000","339683","There are billions of dollars involved in an adoption of the ToE, along with immeasurable power and reputation. Probably the largest percentage of it is in the commercial research and application in the medical industry. So much of it, stem cell research, abortion, ""right to die"", animal rights, etc. take on a different political shift when science becomes God. The moral values of the Judeo Christian religion simply get in the way of so much that science wants to do. Tons of money and power hang in the balance. Everybody doesnt. Most in science do because Darwinism is the standard that has been set. Those who practice science set some basic standards and then follow certain paths, and dont like to be questioned about those paths. The funding and social ramifications of it all are comparable politically to the auto industry controversy. Its not possible for humans to soundly prove or disprove what happened before recorded history. Many have tried to successfully build a career on the questioning of the ToE. Theyre discriminated against, treated rudely, and largely ignored, but they exist. Its not something that happened overnight - philosophers like Herbert Spencer and Thomas Huxley have been spreading social implications of Evolution ever since Darwin wrote Origin Of Species. There doesnt have to be a defined ""shot calling"" leadership of it any more than there has to be one in Judeo Christianity. The two are actually comparable - Christianity gets its leadership/organization through Biblical reference and church leadership. Evolution gets its leadership/organization through the philosophical writings of everyone from Herbert Spencer to Richard Dawkins. It's established in university administrations and peer review. That's the ""top"" - that's where the leadership is. There is a conflict between religion and science. If the scientific community pretends there is not, it raises questions about how many other things they are less than honest about. It has been, and continues to be, pulled off. Here on Amazon , scroll down and read the description, then the three reviews of this book.","Smallax","339919","One point to clarify is that - grants of money come from gov't. Gov't has a vested interest in setting the moral code of a nation. Human chattle rather than soveriegn citizens make their power and control grow exponentially. A Constitutional Republic required officials to be elected to serve the people. Now we have gov't officials to rule the people. Does anyone understand the difference? Not likely, because the gov't grants support ways to teach children what to think not how to think. Clean science is about 2+2=4 no matter what your belief system is. But if gov't says that 2+2=4 because the belief system was a result of no God - then anyone who agrees - gets money to convince the masses that belief in God would make 2+2=anything. That is why Nova has to say something like - ""...over millions of years this organism adapted to accomplish 'x' in its environment."" They say it over and over again even though there is NO legitamate clue as to how 'they adapted'. And that will never be admitted to or they lose their funding. So what is the end result?

Carey expressed a view that intelligent design is ultimately a negation of what science is about. A view of the religions that believe in it, not exclusive to Christianity.

And contrary to what evolutionists now claim regarding what format they used, the fact is that they taught evolution as a scientific explanation for our origins and they taught creationism as a religious explanation for how we came to be. And what is most incredible is that they left it up to us regarding which theory we believed. I remember very clearly asking one of my teachers which theory she believed was correct, and her response was that what she believed was irrelevant as all that mattered was which one made sense to us as individuals. When I pressed her for an answer, she admitted that evolution made more sense to her, but her tests would be based only us knowing the material covered in class, not whether we believed or accepted any of it as factual. OH for the days when schools taught children how to think, but not what to think. That is the reason for education after all, or it once was I should say. But today our children are told what to think, and if any of them have the convictions or personal fortitude to question what they are being spoonfed, they are excoriated as brainwashed and ignorant pawns of religious dogma which will be the destruction of a civilized society. The freedom to think and consider alternatives no longer exists in todays America. And what these young promoters of evolution here are totally unaware of is that debates went on and warnings were sounded 30 and 40 years ago that if education continued as the secular humanists were directing it back then, that within one or two generations we would be precisely where we are today with a closed education system which denies children the option of even making an individual choice after having just received the known facts of what these opposing theories represent.","global-conspiracy-scientists","10:21 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","20"
"01-12-2009","12202",2,"marc9000","339868","So youre saying we would not have clindamycin without the ToE? What are the possibilities that evolution is brought in as a narrative gloss after a discovery, rather than being a cornerstone of all of biology, or all of science? Often, when political or court decisions are made concerning those things, evolutionary biologists are consulted. The above book by Pamela Winnick shows a lot about how science and politics are not always separate from each other. A conservative Christian seminary isnt a public entity that falls under the establishment clause of the first amendment like most US universities, and public education. [Behe's irreducible complexity argument] doesnt fail, it shows a lesser probability of Godless evolution. Showing a lesser probability of something that is supposed to have happened by randomness millions of years ago is notable. This goes back to what my link above referenced, there is no neutrality . If I told you I was about to write something about evolution, would you have a pretty good idea, before reading it, about whether or not you were going to reject it? [Me:] Herbert Spencer has become famous for his ""Social Darwinism."" But the irony here is, Spencer was pushing his ideas for more than a decade BEFORE the Origin was published. It is a mischaracterization of history to claim that Spencer's ideas have anything to do with the ""implications"" of evolution at all. [Wikipedia:] Spencer developed an all-embracing conception of evolution as the progressive development of the physical world, biological organisms, the human mind, and human culture and societies. Who is misrepresenting history? [Wikipedia:] But although after reading Darwin's work he coined the phrase 'survival of the fittest' as his own term for Darwin's concept, and is often misrepresented as a thinker who merely applied the Darwinian theory to society , he only grudgingly incorporated natural selection into his preexisting overall system. The primary mechanism of species transformation that he recognized was Lamarckian use-inheritance which posited that organs are developed or are diminished by use or disuse and that the resulting changes may be transmitted to future generations.","Matthew","339932","Nope. I'm saying that we wouldn't understand why clindamycin works on anything other than bacteria, like most other antibiotics. Because as it happens, clindamycin can be used on some eukaryotic parasites, namely Toxoplasma , the cause of toxoplasmosis, and Plasmodium , the cause of malaria. And it works without destroying host cells or their mitochondria. This is because it turns out that Toxoplasma and Plasmodium contain organelles that were once chloroplasts , as can be shown by these organelles' DNA. When Intelligent Design (or any other form of creationism) comes up with an explanation for how chloroplasts wind up in a non-photosynthetic organism at all, or for why the DNA of these organelles so closely resembles that of chloroplasts if there is no relationship between them, then I will fall to my knees and sing the glories of ID. But my hunch is that all ID can say on the matter is, ""It is so, thanks to the inscrutable intentions of the creator."" Which may be true, I suppose, but which cannot reasonably called an "" explanation "" of anything. Not very good. The Discovery Institute article is dead wrong. Even sticking to the example I've given above, evolution has lead to hypotheses about what other sorts of non-bacterial illnesses clindamycin and other similar antibiotics can treat, as well as suggesting hypotheses about how to improve the treatment of the non-bacterial illnesses we already know it can. The generation of further hypotheses is hardly what I would call mere ""narrative gloss."" Meanwhile, so what if some research projects don't have direct evolutionary input? The double helical structure of DNA, for example, doesn't require evolution in order to be discovered and observed. But what about explaining it? No one ever said that evolution was going to be directly relevant to every aspect of every project. This hardly changes the fact that it is directly relevant to many aspects of many projects, and secondarily relevant to many more. So the author's point is really quite pointless. And his comments about the irrelevance of Darwinian natural selection to antibiotic and pesticide resistance studies is... well, I mean, wow . One wonders who exactly were the ""biologists"" he ""queried"" about this. Citations of literature would be nice; I will leave it to you to decide what it means that he offered none. And how does the book show any connection between the explanations of evolutionary biology and the particular prescriptions for or against any particular answer to those value questions? The excerpt on Amazon offered no such connection. I've been reading Michael Ruse's Darwinism and Its Discontents . In the opening to one chapter, he points out that Darwinism has been criticized by opposite sides for precisely opposed moral reasons. He cites an excellent pair: Phillip Johnson is a conservative and a Christian; he opposes Darwinism because he thinks it subverts traditional values. Richard Lewontin is a Marxist and an atheist; he opposes Darwinism because he thinks it supports traditional values. Which is just to show that, trying to draw a straight line between Darwinian evolution and particular answers to particular questions of value simply can't be done. Which is really no surprise: in philosophy, we call this the ""Is-Ought"" distinction. Maybe you should read up on that. Meanwhile, the ""secular neutrality is a myth"" article had nary a thing to say on using evolution to justify ethical positions, which makes it totally irrelevant to the point at issue here. It was, however, another ironic example of conservative Christianity's slide into self-undermining relativism. ""All bioethics are biased?"" Well, okay. How exactly does that help her own case about what bioethics ought to be? For she, too, must be biased! How is that relevant? Public universities teach evolution. By no means does this conflict with all religious views. And for those whose religious views are offended, they are not required to accept anything about evolution. The idea is that if students are going to take a biology class, then they have to come away with an understanding of biology. Part of what that means is, they will have to study evolution, and they will be graded on how well they understand it. If they are so inclined, they may choose to reject what biology says about evolution for non-biological reasons, e.g. because they believe a literal interpretation of Genesis is true. But at least now they'll understand what they're rejecting. And of course, just because they understand the biological idea they reject, that doesn't mean that their rejection is itself a biological idea. If you can show me how any of that violates the 1st Amendment's Establishment Clause, by all means do so. I'm afraid all Behe can show is that evolution doesn't produce extremely complex features in a single step. But nobody ever disputed that. And he certainly didn't show that in order to produce extremely complex features via very many steps over a long period of time, one must invoke intelligence. Which is a self-undermining tactic: Since your opponents cannot be neutral, why should they try? Since you cannot be neutral, why should anyone think you're any less biased than they are? Heck, if bias is unavoidable, why even think it's bad? Like I said, the article is just another example of conservative Christianity's sadly ironic slide into relativism. Sure I would. But it's precisely to avoid this kind of bias that peer review is done blind . Reviewers don't know whose work they're reviewing, so they can't let their pre-judgements about an author influence their assessments of the merits of his work. Regarding Herbert Spence, I had written: You then cite the Wikipedia entry on Spencer: And then you ask: I'm afraid that you are. Spencer's own position has nothing to do with how evolutionary biology works. He developed it prior to the publication of Darwin's Origin (1859), beginning with Social Statics (1851) and maturing by the publication of ""Progress: Its Law and Cause"" (1857). And as is noted in the remainder of the very Wikipedia article you cite: Spencer's version of evolution is not even Darwin's, let alone the refined Darwinian version employed in contermporary biology. So as I said, I think you're mischaracterizing history. No necessary.","global-conspiracy-scientists","11:03 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","21"

(High school class of '92.) But what they didn't do was teach the religious explanation in a science class. It was taught in a history class, concerning religion and value systems. And here's how it was taught: Christian narratives and doctrines were discussed with attention to sectarian diversity. Christian narratives and doctrines were discussed alongside those of non-Christian religions and the option of no religion at all. Students were not required to accept any particular sect or religion or ir/religious idea. Nor were they required to accept any particular view of the compatibility of religion and science. As a result, it was readily apparent that there were far more options than just two. And every student in the room was thereby forced to think . The only drawback I can see to the way this class was handled was, it was merely an elective rather than a required course, so only 10% of the 400-500 of my high school's yearly grads ever took it. For those of us who did take it, though, it was an extraordinary experience. If creationists were content to promote classes like the non-proselytizing, non-science class I described above, then even I would be on their side. But so long as they try to use science classes to promote particular religious views, or even just to address non-scientific religious ideas, they're going to run into a world of resistance. And rightly so, in my estimation.","global-conspiracy-scientists","12:37 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","28"
