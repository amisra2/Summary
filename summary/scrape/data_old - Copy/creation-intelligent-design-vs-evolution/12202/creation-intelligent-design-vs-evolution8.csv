I know I do, and I regret it afterwards. I will say, however, that after following these threads for a couple of months now, the most habitual abuser of such tactics, BY FAR, is Archangel. I've noticed quite a few snide comments between Archangel and several of his ""adversaries""; there's such a back and forth there that I honestly can't say who started it. It's pretty weak on both sides (albeit occasionally amusing), to be perfectly frank. Regarding the exchanges between Matthew and Archangel, however, the one-sided nature of the well poisoning has been absolutely striking. I've honestly never seen such consistently reprehensible and intellectually weak behavior from an adult (e.g., Archangel's attacks on Matthew's spiritual beliefs when Matthew respectfully questions Archangel's reasoning).","global-conspiracy-scientists","08:39 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","106"

On multiple occasions you have attacked my literalist view of interpreting the bible as being motivated by our personal value system. But what you don't and couldn't know is that prior to being saved I was just like everyone else here who's acting in the flesh rather than the spirit. I have been where you're at, but you haven't seen through my eyes or else you would agree with me on spiritual issues which you currently disagree with and debate against ad infinitum. Just because you're blind to what I see, it doesn't mean that you are any where near being right in what you perceive to be true. You can't even make the connection that when a verse in the New Testament is speaking about the Lord, that it is referring to Jesus Christ, the Messiah. There is no possible way a spirit filled believer could be blind to such an obvious reference to Messiah. Jesus said: Jhn 17:14 I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world. Jhn 17:15 My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one. Jhn 17:16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of it. Jhn 17:17 Sanctify [fn] them by the truth; your word is truth. By questioning the word of God you are questioning Gods truth Matthew. And you and I are from different worlds which is why you can't relate to where I'm coming from spiritually, just as the Lord is not of this world and you can't relate to Him either. If you could, you would clearly see that the Lord is Jesus. He also said this: Mat 10:22 And you will be hated by all for My name's sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved. Mat 10:23 When they persecute you in this city, flee to another. For assuredly, I say to you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes. Mat 10:24 ""A disciple is not above [his] teacher, nor a servant above his master. Mat 10:25 It is enough for a disciple that he be like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, [fn] how much more [will they call] those of his household! Mat 10:26 Therefore do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known. See verse 22 Matt? It should haunt you that all of the deniers of God on this forum have no problem at all with your version of Christianity. If you were representing the gospel truth here, they would hate you just as they hate me and the other christians who defend Christ against their lies and perversions of Gods truth. See verses 23 and 24? You should expect to be persecuted for defending Christ, just as He was persecuted by dying for your sins. But your beliefs don't offend the unbelievers here. They don't have any problem at all with your version of christianity because all you do is claim to be a believer as you deny the power there of. And as I said before; I'm not saying this to attack you but to wake you up to the hypocrisy which you represent by promoting spiritual lies as you insist they are truths. You are doing more harm than good from the perspective of Gods truth being nullified in favor of fleshly doctrines and interpretations. Verses 25 and 26 are obvious to me. Can you discern what they are saying?","global-conspiracy-scientists","12:12 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","109"

"01-18-2009","12202",8,"Matthew","340474","In the interests of time, I'm going to trim this response down a bit. I hope that won't seem too much of a cop-out! But I think some interesting issues can be focused well enough that there won't be much lost. I. Thanks! And indeed it couldn't. The thing is, these sorts of cases are not so ""few"" as you might think! II. Well, first off, let me say that it was not my intention to mock you! I can certainly be blunt and combative, and sometimes I will tease. But I have no desire to mock you. I am sorry for coming off that way. But I should also say that I don't set much store by the idea that atheism is taking over science. One doesn't have to be an atheist to be a good scientist or get one's work accepted by the scientific community. It's just that one doesn't have to be a theist for these things, either. Which is as it should be. We all live in the same empirically observable natural world. It shouldn't matter whether one is Catholic or Protestant, Jewish or Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist, atheist or agnostic: the science is the same for all of us. As for the specifics of the explanation you cited, I guess I think it takes more than a ""flow of events"" for a ""conspiracy."" Industrialization involved a ""flow of events,"" and not everyone was happy about them. But it wasn't a ""conspiracy."" (And even Marx didn't think so!) What we need are an identifiable set of real, particular conspirators who intend to control, and who do in fact control, the scientific community in order to bring about a desired end. And that's what we don't have yet. Anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion, says Nobel Prize winner Steven Weinberg, should be done and may in the end be our greatest contribution to civilization. III. With this, we're into the book you had recommended. If you need to go back and look at your post again (or mine), or if you need to go to Amazon to look at the review you cited or the excerpt from the book, then take a sec and do so. But I think it's pretty clear when one looks at all of this: there is no specific connection being drawn between evolution and these moral problems. Sure, such a connection is claimed . But where's the evidence ? Perhaps it's out there, I'm not going to rule out the possibility. But the arguments so far provided don't connect evolution to these problems. For good measure, look at the following paragraph of yours: Fair enough. But what does evolutionary biology have to do with all these things? You can't just drop in a sentence saying that it's connected with value among comments about hypocritical actors and California crumbling and have done with it! Or the following: Probably not! But how would that imply anything about whether evolution is good science? You continue: Quite possibly! But what does it have to do with evolution? As I said at the outset, I think you're running a lot of ideas together here, without making a careful analysis. When it comes to issues of morality and policy, neither evolution in particular nor science in general can't tell us what we ought to do. They can tell us how things work, and that's it. Science could tell you what the effects of abortion are, but it doesn't say when you ""should"" have one -- if ever. Science can explain what happens when you drill for oil, but it doesn't tell you whether you ""ought"" to drill or not. This is what I meant in invoking the is-ought to distinction. III.A. Because Lewontin has always thought that adaptation and natural selection are overestimated, and he has nothing but scorn for applying Darwinism to human beings. My point is simply that you can't go from Darwinian evolution to values. Some conservatives think it gives you a leftist nightmare. Some liberals think it gives you a right-wing nightmare. Obviously, they can't both be right, at least not in any general sense. The reality is always more complicated than that. IV. True enough, and I don't mean to deny it! But the question is, is the scientific backing they believed they possessed really something they had? I think in the case of Spencer, the answer is no. He didn't even care for natural selection, because he recognized -- as did Darwin -- that it doesn't necessitate absolute progress, only relative progress. Despite coining the phrase ""survival of the fittest"" for Darwin, Spencer's view of evolution was progressivist and Lamarckian to the core. So I don't think it is at all accurate to treat Darwin's work as if it grounds or implies Spencer's. Needless to say, this applies a fortiori to contemporary evolutionary biology. Ruse has done some interesting work on this, separating out the metaphysical and value-laden philosophies of evolution (including that held by Darwin himself) from the empirical and value-neutral science of evolution (derived from Darwin's scientific work and refined for over a century now). Sure! But how does that show that there's some intrinsic, logical connection between evolution and Spencer's laissez-faire capitalism or other social theories? It simply doesn't, which is exactly why Wallace could be a socialist and Gould could be a Marxist. (I hasten to add that it would be just as gross a mistake to think that evolution justifies socialism, too.)","marc9000","340720","I agree - that's fine. That may very well be, but theres no guarantee that its always a good thing, if there are costs involved. One of the things thats always said to me on these forums is that evolution (a belief in a common ancestor for both humans and animals) works. I dont agree that it always works, if it puts the interests of animals above those of humans, or imposes questionable costs. I wasnt really accusing you of that my fault for implying it. I was referring to the OP, and many other threads that Ive been involved with before this, on this subject. Yet? Do you think it might eventually get here? The movie Expelled, and several books (of both extremes) tell me that it may be closer than we think. Ever hear of The God Delusion by Dawkins, or Victor Stengers The failed hypothesis how science shows that God does not exist? How about this statement; The Atheists Bible by Joan Konner (Editor) < Books | PopMatters I'm told that statements like that are just one persons opinion, and don't mean a thing. If his statements don't mean anything, how did he get his Nobel Prize? Evolution is a tool, taken beyond reasonable limitations to philosophical projections. Remember, the OP wasnt about questioning evolution , it was about questioning evolutionists like Mr Weinberg. The subsequent question that is usually asked of me then is am I saying that I want products (like clindamycin) to not be produced just because religious people may not want it to be produced? My answer is that it depends on the reasons put fourth by religious people. If the religious people say they dont want it because they believe in prayer over modern medicine, then I usually dont agree with them. But if the religious people say they dont want it because their knowledge of money management as described in the Bible says that our society cant afford it, then I may agree with them. The ever increasing problem we have in the US is that a demand for a product is often a lot larger than a willingness to pay for that product. Going back to the prop 71 example, Reeve, Fox, Hoffman and Pitt all wanted a product (research results), but they certainly werent willing to pay for it out of their own pockets. Many, probably most, people who demand new drug technology also demand that their insurance company pay for it. Often they dont stop to think where insurance companies get money, because they dont care. Not caring isnt a good glue to hold a society together. Taxing people for unlimited scientific research is just as wrong as taxing them to redistribute their wealth, because it can be the same thing! I agree science doesnt. But were finding that scientists often do. Do you think its an area of concern when most statistics clearly show that there is a disproportionate balance of scientists who are atheists vs the general public who are atheists? Its complicated, but much complicated literature has been written claiming that values can/do come from Darwinian evolution. My point is that God is either absent or present. If Spencer, Darwin, Lewontin, Dawkins, Wallace, and Gould all have positions that differ greatly, its very significant that they have one big thing in common, a non-belief in Gods involvement. Opinions in US politics vary all over the place, but when all is said and done, we almost always see a two way conflict. Its the reason we have only two major political parties. We always hear the terms religious right or atheist left (secular left, humanist left, etc.) but we never hear of religious left or atheist right, do we? If Spencer, Darwin, Lewontin, Dawkins, Wallace, and Gould cant agree on anything else, they can always agree on one thing that the book of Genesis is wrong, that creationists are wrong. Its a big political uniter.

Some of the revisions are fairly substantial. Just thought you should know.] Archie, it is my contention that everyone's interpretation of the Bible is motivated by contingencies of his personal value system, and by much else besides. This applies to the authors of the Bible themselves, to the founders of Christianity, to you, and even -- it should go without saying, but for clarity's sake, I must mention it -- to me. But I have never said that the fact that it reflects your personal values is why your view (or anyone else's) is false. To do so would clearly be ad hominem. And if that's what you think I've done, then you've misunderstood me. As to my other complaints, however, those still stand. I have never called you a ""pseudo-Christian"" or a ""mental midget."" I have never questioned the sincerity of your beliefs or declared you spiritually dead. I have never presumed to know anything about your personal relationship with God. And I have certainly never placed myself on a ""higher plane of understanding"" than you or any other poster. I am mighty sick and tired of repeatedly receiving such abuse in an ostensibly reasonable discussion. That's great, Archie. I have found some of your personal comments quite moving. But how do they solve any of the issues in this debate? This doesn't even hold up in the Gospels. The first use of ""Lord"" in the New Testament (NIV) is at Matthew 1:20, with its reference to ""an angel of the Lord ."" The term appears throughout the Christmas story, and during neither that passage nor what follows can ""Lord"" be described as an unambiguous reference to the Person of the Son. Compare similar passages in the beginning of Luke. Note, for example, Luke 1:31-33, when the angel visits Mary: Or moving to the stage after Jesus' birth, consider Matthew 22: 34-40, an account of ""the Greatest Commandment"": Compare Mark 12: 28-31 or Luke 10:25-28 for two other accounts, both of which also depict Jesus Himself using the expression ""the Lord your God."" That's just a handful of passages from the Gospels. The letters of Paul are also filled with references to ""the Lord."" Many of these unambiguously refer to Christ, for they say things like ""our Lord Jesus Christ."" But many of them are every bit as ambiguous as the one that occasioned this dispute in the first place, using ""the Lord"" without qualification of any Person. In any event, I believe your contention, that when it appears in the New Testament, the word ""Lord"" must be interpreted as a reference to the Son, is erroneous. Not so. Even if the narratives aren't literally true, they may still reveal the truth. You can keep making this charge, but it will never hold water. When are you going to learn that, since I do not regard the Bible as literal, infallible, or authoritative, that appealing to it is not enough to convince me of anything? In the first place, I do not believe that the criticism here amounts to ""hate."" In the second, I do not think that persecution is a sufficient indicator of rectitude.","global-conspiracy-scientists","08:14 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","114"

If the Holy Spirit indwelled you, you would know and believe that it's inspired by God at every level of your being. It doesn't matter what your motivation is Matt, the fact is that you are more dedicated to debating every aspect of my interpretation of the bible than you are in correcting the deniers of God and His word. You claim to be a follower of Christ yet you are dividing the house by opposing an alleged brother in Christ rather than defending Christ with Him against those who slander and blaspheme God here. You are a blatant hypocrite in your denials and inconsistencies as a so called believer. Look at subaru's blasphemies? Have you once spoken against him/her? No! in fact once you even referred to his post in a complimentary fashion as you attack my beliefs. But you just don't get it, do you! Sorry if the truth offends you Matt. You are free to either not respond to my posts or to put me on ignore. If you don't spew your shallow fleshly interpretations of the bible as you oppose me, I wont expose them or you for what they/you are. They were attempts to reach YOU with the truth Matt. I'm not here to hurt you or beat you. I'm trying to get you to look inward and to see your spiritual need which can only be satisfied by a personal relationship with the living God. Sure it can, and it does. Because the Son, in His eternal position is the Word of God and Lord of all who spoke creation into existence. So the Angel of the Lord was referring to the same person who was to be born to Mary. He even makes it clearer by attributing her pregnancy to the Holy Spirit. How many Lords could the bible be referring to Matt, under such a circumstance? The problem is that you don't have the Holy Spirit to guide you according to the promise Jesus made to us before He left to prepare a place for us with Him. If you did, this would be a no brainer for you. True, this reference is to Lord God the Father. Again, it's obvious and this time you recognized it accurately. Did I say that every single reference to the Lord in the bible was referring to Jesus? Absolutely NOT. All I said is that your inability to tell when it does is very telling about your spiritual condition. You are attempting to interpret the word with the flesh, and I'm trying to tell you that it isn't possible. Only through the power of the Holy Spirit does Gods word come alive to us. This isn't to say that you can't get where you need to be. I'm only saying that you aren't there yet, spiritually speaking. Again you corrupt what I say. I never said that every reference to the Lord was an unambiguous reference to Jesus. Maybe that's true in your mind, but it isn't true to God. And in the final analysis that is all that matters. When are you going to realize that this statement is all the evidence that's required to prove that you aren't a born again christian/believer in Christ as you falsely claim to be. If the Holy Spirit indwelled you according to the promises of Jesus Christ the Savior, you would never make such a statement. You couldn't make such a statement. This is why my statement is absolutely true that you have more in common with the atheists, the secular humanists and the unbelievers than you have with me. So please stop claiming to be a member of the family of God and a believer who just happens to disagree with a fellow believer Matt. Because we have absolutely nothing at all in common. We are literally from different worlds my friend. And I have no problem relating to you on that level at all. Nor answering your questions. But to lie to these other unbelievers while claiming the authority of a true believer as you deny the power there of is a serious sin which God will not look kindly on. I repeat Jesus prayer to the Father before dying for our sins, on behalf of TRUE believers. Jhn 17:14 I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world. Jhn 17:15 My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one. Jhn 17:16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of it. Jhn 17:17 Sanctify [fn] them by the truth; ""your"" word is truth. If Gods truth was evident in you, this passage would be fulfilled within you. See the bolded Matthew? The word is the bible which Jesus is calling Gods truth. Your statement above means you are calling both Jesus and Father God a liar. Would a true believer be able to do that? The answer is no. By denying the truth of Gods word you deny God Himself. I don't know how many different ways I can clarify this for you. But with each new post you write, you just further prove how lost you are. Sorry, but it's better that you know the truth of your standing rather than waste a lifetime piously denying the truth of your true standing with the living God. Only after accepting that truth can you move on to find the whole truth which only comes by way of the word of God.","global-conspiracy-scientists","08:56 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","116"

Don't believe me Matt, but if you SINCERELY hunger for His truth at all, and this isn't just some pseudo intellectual exercise to you, then please listen to ""Jesus Himself"" when He explained it to Nicodemus. Jhn 3:1 Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews; Jhn 3:2 this man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, ""Rabbi, we know that You have come from God {as} a teacher; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him."" Jhn 3:3 Jesus answered and said to him, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God."" Jhn 3:4 Nicodemus *said to Him, ""How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born, can he?"" Jhn 3:5 Jesus answered, ""Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Jhn 3:6 ""That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Jhn 3:7 ""Do not be amazed that I said to you, 'You must be born again.' Jhn 3:8 ""The wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit."" Jhn 3:9 Nicodemus said to Him, ""How can these things be?"" Jhn 3:10 Jesus answered and said to him, ""Are you the teacher of Israel and do not understand these things? Jhn 3:11 ""Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know and testify of what we have seen, and you do not accept our testimony. Jhn 3:12 ""If I told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things? Jhn 3:13 ""No one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended from heaven: the Son of Man. Jhn 3:14 ""As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; Jhn 3:15 so that whoever believes will in Him have eternal life.

Jhn 3:18 ""He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. Jhn 3:19 ""This is the judgment, that the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. Jhn 3:20 ""For everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come to the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed.

"01-19-2009","12202",8,"marc9000","340720","That may very well be, but theres no guarantee that its always a good thing, if there are costs involved. One of the things thats always said to me on these forums is that evolution (a belief in a common ancestor for both humans and animals) works. I dont agree that it always works, if it puts the interests of animals above those of humans, or imposes questionable costs. The movie Expelled, and several books (of both extremes) tell me that it [the atheist take-over of science] may be closer than we think. Ever hear of The God Delusion by Dawkins... ...or Victor Stengers The failed hypothesis how science shows that God does not exist? How about this statement: ""'Anything we scientists can do to weaken the hold of religion,' says Nobel Prize winner Steven Weinberg, 'should be done and may in the end be our greatest contribution to civilization.'"" I'm told that statements like that are just one persons opinion, and don't mean a thing. If his statements don't mean anything, how did he get his Nobel Prize? ...am I saying that I want products (like clindamycin) to not be produced just because religious people may not want it to be produced? My answer is that it depends on the reasons put fourth by religious people. If the religious people say they dont want it because they believe in prayer over modern medicine, then I usually dont agree with them. But if the religious people say they dont want it because their knowledge of money management as described in the Bible says that our society cant afford it, then I may agree with them. The ever increasing problem we have in the US is that a demand for a product is often a lot larger than a willingness to pay for that product. Going back to the prop 71 example, Reeve, Fox, Hoffman and Pitt all wanted a product (research results), but they certainly werent willing to pay for it out of their own pockets. Many, probably most, people who demand new drug technology also demand that their insurance company pay for it. Often they dont stop to think where insurance companies get money, because they dont care. Not caring isnt a good glue to hold a society together. Taxing people for unlimited scientific research is just as wrong as taxing them to redistribute their wealth, because it can be the same thing! Do you think its an area of concern when most statistics clearly show that there is a disproportionate balance of scientists who are atheists vs the general public who are atheists? Its complicated, but much complicated literature has been written claiming that values can/do come from Darwinian evolution. My point is that God is either absent or present. If Spencer, Darwin, Lewontin, Dawkins, Wallace, and Gould all have positions that differ greatly, its very significant that they have one big thing in common, a non-belief in Gods involvement. Opinions in US politics vary all over the place, but when all is said and done, we almost always see a two way conflict. Its the reason we have only two major political parties. We always hear the terms religious right or atheist left (secular left, humanist left, etc.) but we never hear of religious left or atheist right, do we? If Spencer, Darwin, Lewontin, Dawkins, Wallace, and Gould cant agree on anything else, they can always agree on one thing that the book of Genesis is wrong, that creationists are wrong. Its a big political uniter.","Matthew","340803","I'm afraid I don't understand where you're coming from here. Evolution ""works"" in the scientific sense: it explains disparate phenomena, and it yields testable predictions. There is nothing about evolution that requires us to place any particular relative value on the interests of humans and animals. I do think that disregarding the interests of animals, and of all other organisms, is deeply unwise even from the standpoint of human interests. For our own long-term existence depends crucially on how well the environment around us continues to function. But this is an entirely general position, which leaves open the question of what particular actions would be wise or unwise. And perhaps more pertinently to this discussion, it's not a position that derives from evolution. And I really don't understand what you mean by ""questionable costs."" Do you have in mind the economic side of the ""particular actions"" I alluded to in my preceding paragraph? Because as I said before, I think there are clearly trade-offs that have to be made. But evolutionary biology is not what decides which to make and which not to. Perhaps I've misunderstood you (and perhaps you didn't even have economics in mind). I confess that I haven't seen Expelled . In part, I will admit, this is because I have heard some very bad things about it, including deception practiced by the film-makers to get some of the biologists to participate. But perhaps I will go and take a look sometime. Sure. It's a non-science book written by a scientist. I read it. I thought his view of theism was superficial and dismissive of the diversity of theistic options available, and I found his grasp of certain ideas and arguments to be tenuous. On the other hand, I do think he made some good points about the dangers of religious extremism and about morality transcending particular religions, and my favorite part of the book was his evolutionary explanation of why traditions are maintained. Overall, it was decent, but nothing world-changing. Not for me, at least. I've seen it, but I haven't read it. I've read similar arguments before, though, and I don't think that science is capable of showing any such thing. Atheistic philosophers are running a better track, but I don't think they've disproved the existence of God, either. There are plenty of atheistic scientists and philosophers who actually agree with that assessment (e.g. Michael Ruse or Philip Kitcher). But this is a bit misleading! Because he didn't get his Nobel for his statements about religion . He got it for his statements about science . I still have trouble thinking that these fellows' views qualify as a take-over of science. There have been scientists themselves, including biologists -- e.g. Ken Miller or Francis Collins or Francisco Ayala -- who reject these guys views on religion, often quite publicly. And they have no trouble at all getting their work published, just as many other religious scientists don't. Fair enough. But my point is, this is an economic argument. It has no bearing at all on evolution's merits as biology . As I've said, there are most definitely economic trade-offs involved here. If you think research into any particular field is not something we can afford, that's fine. You're free to say so, and to vote for people who think so as well. Just as we all are. But no governmental funding decisions will determine what is or isn't correct science. So I'm afraid that I still don't see your point with this line of argument. No. Science is grounded in empiricism. It is neutral on the metaphsyical question of theism vs. atheism: whether God exists or not, the empirical evidence remains what it is. Because of this neutrality, science has been far more tolerant of atheism than the rest of society. It is only natural that atheists would gravitate there. And keep in mind that while science is compatible with atheism, it is also compatible with theism. It doesn't require either one. So no, I don't see any reason to worry. Indeed. But many of those claims are false ! This is especially so when one attempts to derive particular ethical injunctions from general features evolved in human nature -- e.g. human beings are evolved to cooperate and therefore ought to be socialists, or men are evolved to be stronger than women and therefore women should not serve in the military. But why is that so significant? People like Miller or Collins take quite a different view. What they have in common with the above guys is a belief in evolution, not atheism. Moreover, I've even read some post-modernists (and I apologize, but no names are coming readily to mind; po-mo is not really my thing) who are atheists but anti-evolutionists (they see both science and religion as efforts at social control). The questions of whether or not life evolved and whether or not God exists are entirely independent of each other. You could answer either question either way, with no necessary implication for how you must answer the other question. I think that's far too simple. Because there are lots of diverse opinions covered under those blanket groupings. The ""religious right"" is most commonly associated with evangelical Christians, but it also contains many Catholics and Mormons. The ""secular left"" includes Marxists like Gould and non-Marxists like Dawkins, and many an anti-scientific post-modernist comparative literature professor, as well. And actually there is growing ""religious left"" in this country, as can be seen with people like John Shelby Spong or Jim Wallis or Robert McElvaine. There's also an ""atheist right"" -- just consider Christopher Hitchens, for example. And there are people who don't neatly fit these categories. For example, the followers of Ayn Rand (also known as Objectivists) are certainly atheists, but like many ""libertarian""-ish groups, their economic policies seem right-wing while their social policies seem left-wing. And how the heck do we categorize Buddhists? You forgot to mention Miller, Collins, Ayala, et al , from the camp of Christian biologists! For you see, it's not a matter of political unity, and still less is it a matter of religious unity. It's a matter of scientific unity. The overwhelming majority have been convinced, on the basis of evidence, that a literal reading of Genesis is, in fact, wrong. Beyond that, however, they have widely divergent views of just how non-literally true and/or otherwise meaningful it is.","global-conspiracy-scientists","11:28 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","120"
