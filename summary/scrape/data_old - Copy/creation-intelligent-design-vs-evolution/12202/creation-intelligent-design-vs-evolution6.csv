"01-16-2009","12202",6,"subaru","340298","Your short posting demonstrates how completely ignorant you are of the most elementary aspects of Science! First, the verb ""believe"" is not within the lexicon of science. Science asks us to ""believe"" nothing. The present available evidence shows a remarkable unity in indicating that a ""Big Bang"" of some sort lies at the beginning of the observable universe. However, there is an army of extremely gifted thinkers who have explored every alternative hypothesis of which they are able to conceive, in order to explain the observable facts. That so little success has attended their efforts is, in itself, impressive. It is impossible that Science asks us to believe that the universe is as it is by luck, since there is is no generally agreed-upon definition of the word ""luck."" A fortiori , there are no hypothetical mechanisms which would make sense of such a conception. (But see the astounding revelations below, especially postings #5, #6, and #9): http://www.4forums.com/political/wor...lings-1-a.html Perhaps your mental processes might approach some coherent form if you did some research on the concepts: ""chance,"" or ""statistical paradigms."" And don't forget quantum mechanics. Probability takes on quite a counter-intuitive form when probability values range over the complex plane, rather than merely over the positive real numbers. -","gansao","340506","The 'genius' sidesteps the point by giving an English grammar lesson.

"01-16-2009","12202",6,"Archangel","340481","You would be very wrong Matthew, in your assumption. Especially since a believers interpretation of the bible isn't based on His personal experiences, but on the truth of Gods word independent of any and all human experiences. ... That doesn't change the fact that I interpret His word according to His Holy Spirit and you interpret it based on your fleshly understanding. ...the natural man picks and chooses what he will hold to as acceptable based on his personal preferences and opinion of right and wrong. You have no dedicated commitment to the Lord or what He represents or you couldn't just ignore the attacks He receives by unbelievers and atheists around here and just brush it off self righteously as it isn't your responsibility to defend Him. After all, He isn't on this forum to defend Himself, but you're here. And if you truly knew Him personally and loved Him as I do -- -- you would be committed to standing up for Him and defending Him against people who call Him and His word mythical rants of bronze age goat herders. You couldn't stand by and allow that because you would realize that not only is it an attack on His truths, but it's an insult to your intelligence based on your belief in His word. So if that open attack on God doesn't offend you, it's because it doesn't apply to you as one of the Lords followers.","Matthew","340523","Quite possibly! But how would you convince me? All you've done in this post is repeat the problem, not dispel it. And my contention is that, insofar as the ""believers"" in question are one and all human , it is absolutely, unconditionally, completely, totally, entirely, and 100% IMPOSSIBLE for their interpretations of the Bible to be independent of human experiences. Being ""born again"" does not mean no longer being human, and subject to all the limitations thereof. If you think otherwise, that is what I am challenging you to defend. And my point is, you can say your interpretation has no connection to the flesh all you want. Your interpretation nonetheless does remain connected to it. (Unless you can give me some reason to think otherwise, of course.) This doesn't mean that you aren't also inspired and guided by the Spirit. It just means that you can't claim to have transcended your human limitations just because the topic happens to be your religious beliefs. You mean, like, arbitrarily deciding that the word ""Lord"" must be understood to refer to Jesus?... But I digress. You are free to think so. I just happen to think that many professed atheists have most definitely come to the Father through Christ, even if they don't realize it. I also happen to think that many professed Christians don't seem to know Him at all, despite what they may think. By their deeds are they known, in both cases. So atheism simply doesn't bother me. The idea that God would ever need to be ""defended"" from anything that human beings could possibly do is, as I have already pointed out more than once -- and as Subaru also lampooned in his ""blasphemies"" -- absurd . I prefer defending people , who, quite unlike God, can actually be harmed . Indeed, it might even be the case that, when I defend even the least of them, I defend Him after all. And that apologetics is just a devil's sideshow in the service of the aforementioned absurdity. The fact that I don't love Him ""as you do"" doesn't mean that I don't love Him. Why is that so difficult for you to accept? How, exactly, is it an ""insult"" to me at all?

It isn't my job to convince you of it nor is it within my power to. Only by way of the Holy Spirit can you discern spiritual truths. You're no better off than subaru as you ask for evidence which if you truly knew the truth, you would understands only comes through Christ by way of His indwelling Holy Spirit within each believer. And you have more in common with him than me also since you obviously relate to him more than my spiritual perspective. This isn't a group effort but an individual journey for each of us. BUT, and it's a huge BUT, because God is consistent in His dealings with us, all true believers have Him in common. But you and I have nothing in common. We are night and day regarding our spiritual compatibility goes. And you would be absolutely, unconditionally, completely, totally, entirely, and 100% WRONG!!! True, and I never said otherwise. Here's my point Matt, since I can't respond to all of your confused interpretations of what I say. The point is that if we were on the same spiritual plane at all, then this conversation wouldn't be necessary. How can I make it clear to you Matt? When I explain it in my words, you misinterpret what I'm saying because it's beyond you to grasp. And when I post the scriptures that explain your spiritual need you ignore them and demand evidence. If you knew the truth within you, the scriptures I posted would be evidence to you. The very fact that the word of God goes right over your head is the evidence that you have a serious spiritual need. And you can't even see it. Sure, that's an excellent example. Also the fact that you see no reason to speak up for the Lord against the numerous attacks against Him around here. Now look in the mirror when you say that and we'll finally be communicating here. And would you care to show me where the bible say's that those who deny Him will be saved? It's exactly statements like that which fly in the face of biblical truths but sound just fine to your mind. Do you see the bolded word Matt? Do you see how dishonest your response is based on that 2 letter word? I was talking about defending the Lord against what people say and you respond with God doesn't need defense against what people do. A completely fallacious point compared to what I was saying, yet I'm sure it sounded like a reasonable response to you in the moment. Listen here my self righteous friend. You like to sound religious, you just have no idea how to be righteous. These are atheists who hate God and christians. They are not the least of us, they are the most militant and hateful among us. And if you understood that the word of God never comes back void, so sharing it truthfully rather than compromising Gods truths by agreeing with, or making sure you don't challenge them is just abandoning the truths you claim to know and embrace. But again, you are blind to these scriptural truths which should be obvious to you if you knew the truth. Let me be blunt Matt. If you loved Him, you couldn't ignore an atheist making a libelous statement about him which you knew to be untrue for 2 reasons; one, because you would need to defend the truth about your Lord who died for your personal sins, and 2, because your love for the atheist would be so great that you need to correct their error in how they are misjudging God. By just walking by and not caring, you are no better than a Pharisee who would walk past a bleeding man on the road on the Sabbath. I've explained it too many times to repeat myself again. I take attacks on my Heavenly Father personally Matt. But maybe that's just because I actually love Him and have personally experienced His unconditional love for me when He took my sins upon Himself. But again, the personal value of what I'm saying just goes right over your head as you write back asking me to prove it.","global-conspiracy-scientists","11:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","84"

But why is it that, if I ""don't get"" where you're coming from, it's because I ""refuse"" to get it? Why must you always -- and I mean always , without fail -- address people's disagreements with you in terms of incorrect exerise of will rather than incorrect exercise of intellect? Is it possible for someone to honestly disagree with you about religious matters? Or is such disageement ipso facto indicative of character flaws? Do you understand what I'm asking you to convince me of? I didn't ask you to convince me of those spiritual truths. You made a claim, namely that your participation here represents God's words, not any human beliefs or experiences. I want you to convince me that that claim is true. I mean, put yourself in our shoes. Isn't the claim you made exactly what a false prophet would say, no less than a true? So by what criterion can we be sure that you're not a false prophet? Is there any reason you can give us? Okay. Now explain to me why I'm wrong. Simply saying repeatedly that I'm wrong does not establish the fact, no matter how many capital letters or exclamation points you use. All I'm asking for is some reasons . I fail to see why that should arouse such shouting. Not so, Archie! You just said (""!!!"") that I am utterly "" WRONG "" to say that it is impossible for human beings to interpret scripture independently of their human expeiences. So in your view, it clearly is possible for believers to escape at least some of their human limitations, albeit (I assume) only through the grace of God. (And I repeat that I would still like to know by what criterion I would be able to distinguish someone who really has escaped these constraints from someone who merely claims to have escaped them.) Well, all due respect, but it's not me who at one moment says that believers can intepret scripture independently of their human beliefs and experience, but at the next moment denies that human beings can escape their human limitations. If I am confused by your position, I think it has less to do with me than with you. Here's my point: You're being totally inconsistent. I am asking you to give me a rational explanation -- perhaps a modification of things you've already said, perhaps merely a clarification -- that would dispel this inconsistency. Archie, I'm not doing this out of spiritual corruption. I am trying to understand your view -- which, I think we can both agree, I do not. Insofar as, per your own assessment, we are not on the same spiritual plane, would you mind having this conversation? would you mind trying to explain yourself? or are you just going to complain that it shouldn't be necessary? Is it possible -- just maybe -- that some of the fault here is yours ? When people say that they don't understand me , I don't say, ""Sorry, it's beyond your ability"" and then repeat exactly what they already said they don't understand. I try to explain myself more effectively. Why is it so awful of me to ask you to make this sort of attempt? But Archie, you won't explain anything!!! I keep telling you that I don't get it, and that I'd like clarification. And all you do in return is hurl personal abuse, about how I'm spiritually dead and incapable of understanding you. There's really no point engaging in a further substantive debates (e.g. over atheism and what to do about it). Not because our perspectives are so different, for that gap could be bridged. No, the problem is that right now, you don't seem interested in bridging it: all I can reasonably expect is that you'll declare any disagreements with you to be character flaws. And I can think of more spiritually useful (and personally enjoyable) ways to spend my time.","global-conspiracy-scientists","09:58 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","86"
"01-17-2009","12202",6,"smiley","340546","Archie, regarding the bolded, how can there be so many interpretations of god's word if this is true? You don't seem to be able to grasp that 'your interpretation' (which is all that it is) is different from others (including those of other religions) because of your personal experience. To say that a believer only bases their interpretation on the truth of god's word would mean that god has millions of different versions of said truth. And that's a big pile of rubbish, even for you.

There are two types of verses in the bible, relationship and doctrinal. Relationship verses speak to individuals based on their personal convictions, but doctrinal passages are universally applied for all of us regardless of our standing in the body of Christ. Here are two examples: This is a relationship verse which speaks to each individual based on their place within, or without the body of Christ. To every believer who reads this verse, it's taken as a passage of assurance to our salvation; to any unbeliever who reads it, it's interpreted as as warning or a threat. And even to believers it represents degrees of conviction based on our individual submission to elders and/or authority figures. 1Pe 5:5 Likewise you younger people, submit yourselves to [your] elders. Yes, all of [you] be submissive to one another, and be clothed with humility, for ""God resists the proud, But gives grace to the humble.""* This is a universally understood verse of doctrine which say's the same thing to everyone who reads it.
