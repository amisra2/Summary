Even if you knew little about science, tangible scientific findings that could be commercialized would be produced if they were profitable, regardless of which theory or belief they supported. As proven in previous thread, absolutely no scientific commercial products have been derived from YEC creationism yet countless for sciences supporting evolution. Conspiracy you say? Market Capitalism says otherwise.","global-conspiracy-scientists","05:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","2"
"01-09-2009","12202",1,"SickDelirium","339636","Why would such a scheme exist? People don't create conspiracies on a whim; they exist to achieve a goal, specifically some sort of gain that cannot be achieved legitimately. At first glance, there seems to be no gain to be made by adoption of ToE: not money nor power nor reputation. Why would everybody participate in such a conspiracy? Reputations among scientists are made based on the accuracy of their data and the implications of their discoveries. Why has no one successfully built their career on the sound disproval of ToE? Who is calling the shots in this conspiracy? Decisions for the collective actions of a group must be made at the top: an executive management. Who is leading this conspiracy? How are they communicating to scientists around the world?","Huntard","339674","I'll try to give you some answers. Because all scientists hate god, this is a fact. Because all scientists hate god. Again, this is a fact. I am. All scientists are linked to my mind via very secret devices that no one but me knows about. So if you tell anyone else, I'm coming for you! In all seriousness though, I have wondered the same thing. I mean, how exactly do they see this happening? Have they got ANY idea of what an undertaking it would be to pull this off?","global-conspiracy-scientists","06:59 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","3"

"" ....... if you'd enjoy reading a book that is an honest discussion of either politics or science, _A Jealous God_ is not for you. If, however, you enjoy being preached to in unprofessional and underhanded ways about the distaste all religious people should have for scientists, then by all means, pick up this book. If you enjoy poorly edited and non-annotated books written by laymen about the problems with science, then this book's for you. It's certainly not an honest portrayal of anything within the real world or outside of Ms. Winnick's worldview in which scientists are a terrible evil. ......

"01-10-2009","12202",1,"marc9000","339683","There are billions of dollars involved in an adoption of the ToE, along with immeasurable power and reputation. Probably the largest percentage of it is in the commercial research and application in the medical industry. So much of it, stem cell research, abortion, ""right to die"", animal rights, etc. take on a different political shift when science becomes God. The moral values of the Judeo Christian religion simply get in the way of so much that science wants to do. Tons of money and power hang in the balance. Everybody doesnt. Most in science do because Darwinism is the standard that has been set. Those who practice science set some basic standards and then follow certain paths, and dont like to be questioned about those paths. Its not possible for humans to soundly prove or disprove what happened before recorded history. Many have tried to successfully build a career on the questioning of the ToE. Theyre discriminated against, treated rudely, and largely ignored, but they exist. Its not something that happened overnight - philosophers like Herbert Spencer and Thomas Huxley have been spreading social implications of Evolution ever since Darwin wrote Origin Of Species. There doesnt have to be a defined ""shot calling"" leadership of it any more than there has to be one in Judeo Christianity. The two are actually comparable - Christianity gets its leadership/organization through Biblical reference and church leadership. Evolution gets its leadership/organization through the philosophical writings of everyone from Herbert Spencer to Richard Dawkins. It's established in university administrations and peer review. That's the ""top"" - that's where the leadership is. There is a conflict between religion and science. If the scientific community pretends there is not... it raises questions about how many other things they are less than honest about.","Matthew","339699","Perhaps so. But you realize that the reason it gets used in medicine is because it works. Did you know, for example, that clindamycin, an antibiotic, can be used to safely kill certain non-bacterial parasites? Do you know why? Check out Carl Zimmer's excellent Parasite Rex for the answer. Here you are running together a whole lot of things. I would like to know what you see as the detailed connections between the science of evolution and the questions of (1) whether we ought to perform research on embryonic stem cells; (2) whether abortion ought to be legal; (3) whether euthanasia ought to be legal; and (4) how we ought to treat animals. Because as I see it, these are questions of value, and evolutionary biology doesn't decide them one way or the other. Or maybe -- just maybe -- they think that evolution is the best available path to pursue? This line of criticism, about how evolutionists don't like to be questioned, is thoroughly ad hominem: it addresses the matter in terms of the personality traits -- the alleged personality traits, more accurately -- of evolutionary biologists, rather than in terms of whether the evolutionary research program really is the most fruitful one to follow. Meanwhile, so long as we're playing the ad hominem game, couldn't one say much the same thing about a great many theologians? When was the last time a conservative Christian seminary let a Jew teach the students the meaning of Genesis and Exodus, or allowed an atheist to teach the early history of Christian doctrine? Which in no way implies that all hypotheses about what happened before recorded history are equally well-supported. How are they discriminated against? Because they don't get published? Well, when they try to publish something that has scientific merit, they will get published. How are they treated rudely? It is not rude to tell someone that his ideas are wrong. Take Behe, for example. His central concept is ""irreducible complexity"": some phenomena are too complex to be explained by evolution, because if you removed any of their parts, they'd no longer work. But every example the man has ever given -- every example, ever -- doesn't work! It is certainly true that if you remove a single piece from, say, a bacterial flagellum, it will no longer work. But no one disputes that! The issue is, just because it could not now work as a flagellum , that does not mean it could not earlier have worked as something else . And empirical examples of what appear to be arrested or reduced flagella have been produced. So the complexity involved is quite reducible, and Behe's argument fails. The only person I've seen getting rude about all that is Behe himself. He makes indignant declarations about how all these opponents don't understand him at all, and launches ad hominem attacks on their motives and character: they're all just lockstep with the Darwinian orthodoxy, and they don't care about the truth. As for ""largely ignoring"" them, this is partly true. They don't get published in the scientific journals. But their articles are rejected, not ignored. And for reasons such as those above. But it is very hard to say that they're ""ignored"" at all, considering how much attention they seek, and get. Herbert Spencer has become famous for his ""Social Darwinism."" But the irony here is, Spencer was pushing his ideas for more than a decade BEFORE the Origin was published. It is a mischaracterization of history to claim that Spencer's ideas have anything to do with the ""implications"" of evolution at all. And as for Spencer's ideas concerning religion, morality, and policy -- or Huxley's, or anyone else's for that matter -- these simply do not follow from evolution. Alfred Russell Wallace, who discovered the principle of natural selection independently of Darwin, and whose work spurred Darwin to publish the Origin when he did, was a Christian and a socialist. Compare Wallace to Huxley and Spencer, and then consider whether evolution necessarily leads to conservatism or leftism, capitalism or communism, theism or atheism. (As an ironic sidenote, let me point out that most of the American creationists I've ever met favor right-wing economic policies that are very similar to those advocated by Spencer -- even as they decry Darwinism for its allegedly Spencerian connections.) And as I said, Herbert Spencer's ideas predate Darwin's. Meanwhile, Dawkins writings on religion are irrelevant to whether evolution is good biology. Really? So, university presidents and trustees -- the overwhelming majority of whom have no connection with evolution, and most of whom are considerably more politically conservative than university faculties -- are behind the whole thing? Wow. You know, this sort of claim requires evidence . I would like see your evidence of university administration involvement. Got any? And who are the ""top"" in the peer-review process? Editors? Please explain what you mean. NO. There is a conflict between science and some forms of religion. By no means is there a conflict between science and religion, in and of itself. It doesn't, at least not in the sense just provided. I wondered much the same thing after reading Philip Johnson's Darwin on Trial .","global-conspiracy-scientists","09:51 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","6"

I've never met a scientist who wasn't quite pleased to be asked intelligent questions. The problem is that questions motivated by ignorance and just plain stupidity don't merit an answer. A researcher in evo-devo, explaining his work gets a question like, ""Oh yeah? If man evolved from an ape, why are there still apes?"" There are two things that any biologist loves (or any scientist for that matter) - passing along what he knows about his field to others, and learning what others have learned about his field. It isn't being questioned that is offensive. It is the ignorance driven motivations of the questions.","global-conspiracy-scientists","12:06 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","8"
