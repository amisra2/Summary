I am and have been showing you the simple Gospel of Christ which is the ONE way to receive HIS salvation. There is no other way. Don't believe me Matt, but if you SINCERELY hunger for His truth at all, and this isn't just some pseudo intellectual exercise to you, then please listen to ""Jesus Himself"" when He explained it to Nicodemus.","Matthew","340804","I have listened to Him, Archie! You just don't believe me when I say that, because I say other things with which you disagree. You need to differentiate ""the Word of God"" from "" your understanding of the Word of God."" And so must we all. It's a matter of accepting our human limitations. Til then, shalom.","global-conspiracy-scientists","11:43 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","121"

Matthew has accepted Christ as his Saviour and is indwelled by the Holy Spirit. As you do not agree with his interpretation of Holy Scripture (which is God's own Truth), you cannot be indwelled by the Holy Spirit. You have been duped by the Prince of Lies. Your biblical quote 'obviously' shows this to be true.","global-conspiracy-scientists","12:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","123"

I have no objection to religious nuts mumbling their mantras or beating their heads against the Wailing Wall. What I object to is their attempt to foist their delusions on other people. Even more so, I strongly reprehend their all-too-frequent attempts to force other people to practise their meaningless rituals and agree with their lunatic ideas. You just can't trust religious fanatics. When they don't have any power, they bleat about kindness and forgiveness, and how they are as gentle as doves. The moment they get any power, however, they turn into raging monsters: killing, torturing, and generally behaving worse than devils --- as history shows with tedious repetitiveness. The only way to deal with these religious devils is to bind them hand and foot, so that they cannot bring havoc into the world again. Churches should be treated like any other business; all their tax privileges should be stripped from them, and they should be scrutinized with the same regulations and auditing procedures that apply to any other money-making enterprise. If such a program were to be carried out in a thorough manner, the swindlers and shysters would desert religion, and in a few generations religious insanity would in large measure wither and fade away. -","global-conspiracy-scientists","02:46 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","124"

I on the other hand am speaking from personal experience regarding what is required to be a believer, and what the evidence of being a believer is. Get it?

Are you really that far gone that you can't see the point that everyone here is trying to drill through that thick brainwashed skull of yours?

How quick you are to defend something you don't even accept as real for someone other than me. Really? From some posters I'm accused of doing nothing more than posting scriptures as evidence, now from you, I'm accused of saying I'm right because I can't be wrong. I have answered every question and misinterpretation of the bible Matt has given by proving Him wrong with the bible itself, loon. Which might explain why he is gone and his atheist buddies feel the need to defend him. You see my loony friend, there in lies the rub. I'm the only guy here looking at what is being discussed from another perspective. I'm sharing the simple gospel with Matthew. The gospel which I posted in jesus own words. And he insists that he relates while he can't even discern the simplest verse correctly. Matthew knows I have him pegged. He just isn't ready to face it yet. But the word never comes back void if one is seeking the truth. But you aren't seeking that truth tq, you just want to oppose me at any and every turn. So you can speak of other perspectives but that just reveals your ignorance regarding the consistency of God and His Gospel. I realize this is just gibberish to you, but since you're breaking in to a debate you have no right participating in, and since it's about the salvation issue, it only makes sense to support my claim with the bible. Like it or not. Eph 4:4 {There is} one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling; Eph 4:5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism, Eph 4:6 one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all. So tell me genius, how many perspectives do you think God has? And how many ways to heaven do you think He allowed for? Let me give you a clue, He knew any more than one and we would be confused. I mean, look at how muddled the brains of atheists are as it is? So He came Himself as propitiation for our sins.","global-conspiracy-scientists","06:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","129"

Disagreeing with you does not equate to atheism. I am not saying that Matthew is right. What I am trying to point out to you that Matthew is not automatically wrong because he disagrees with you. Despite what you believe, you have no lock on the truth. Which you do. Any time someone questions you, you blather on about the indwelling this and being on a higher spiritual plane. Your ""argument"" boils down to you stating that there is no way you can't be right because it is impossible for you to be wrong. You have done nothing but post scriptures and refused to discuss how you reached your particular conclusion of what they state, other than to blather about how if one was posessed by the holy ghost they'd know you were right. What a nutjob... Again, not an atheist. Wait, the guy who's posessed by a spirit and incapable of dealing with reality is calling me a loon. Right... Which perspective is that? Not anyone else's here. The gospel is not another perspective. Right, the one theologians have spent millenia investigating and interpreting. But you know exactly what it means. What hubris. No, he insists that he relates while he can't even discern the simplest verse the exact same way you do Have you ever attended a bible study class Archie? When someone disagrees with your interpretation of the passage under study, do you denounce them as a false christian, ask them about their atheist buddies, and otherwise mock them and question their faith? Archie, go see a psychiatrist. Seriously. You are so severly messed up it isn't even funny. Yep, and once again all those theologians throughout history were false believers. It took Archie to reveal the truth of the bible. Well, I'm not fluent in ""crazy nutjob-ese"", but I try. Really? How odd. Last time I checked, I was a member, which meant I was free to post in any forum that was open. You are utterly incapable of understanding this point, aren't you: Your interpretation of the bible is not neccesarily correct! Tell me genius, what makes you correct and all others wrong? [Quote]And how many ways to heaven do you think He allowed for?[/Quote Again, what makes you correct and all others wrong? Again, not an atheist, and once again: WHAT MAKES YOU CORRECT AND ALL OTHERS WRONG?

I never said all others are wrong. Only Matthew is in error to claim he has a personal relationship with a Lord he can't even recognize in the most basic of verses. But that is also beyond you to comprehend so I don't expect you to get it either.","global-conspiracy-scientists","09:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","131"

And again, we're back at the beginning; Archie, you are not the arbitrer of truth. You do not have any special insight which tells you that you are right and everyone else is wrong. You most especially do not have the right to decide what someone else believes. And I say the same to you. The idea that you could be wrong is completely foreign to you. The sheer gall displayed by your attitude to Matthew and others is absolutely disgusting and unnerving.","global-conspiracy-scientists","10:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","133"

Yes, the idea that I could be wrong is completely foreign to me. Only because I have personally experienced it and I know first hand the change that takes place in a person who also experiences it. I don't expect another believer to agree with me in all aspects of faith at all. But to disagree with me regarding the most basic aspects of the gospel throws up too many red flags to explain here. Although I've spent quite a bit of time correcting Matthew's misperceptions. That you can't understand my perspective is understandable, but that Matthew, who claims to get it can't is a real problem since he at least claims to care about the truth. All he needs to do now is find it.","global-conspiracy-scientists","10:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","134"

As it happens, I was very busy yesterday. And I will be for the foreseeable future as well, so I'm generally going to be participating less here. No, Archie, I really don't. The simple fact is this: You and I are not discussing anything. Per your own view, I can't understand you. And per your own view, you have no need to understand me. The whole exchange has thus reduced to you arrogantly presuming to tell me about my own relationship with God and me uselessly mounting a defense against someone who refuses a priori to accept it. I'm not doing it any longer. Instead, I will spend my now-more-limited time on this forum engaging posters other than yourself. Feel free to interpret this explanation in terms of whatever character flaws of mine you like.","global-conspiracy-scientists","09:02 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","135"
