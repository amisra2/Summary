"03-29-2008","11082",4,"jyoshu","306953","Perhaps I need to elaborate on what I'm saying here. My point is that no one in monotheism likely set up ""undetectability"" with any intention. (as I said, ""not by any action by 'monotheism' or religious people to do so""--i.e. make it undetectable.) It's just there, by default, because monotheistic gods tend to be the all-powerful sort that are invisible.","Kronus","306962","That's right, I recall now. We went through this before in another thread. You have your own personal definition of ""by default"" which only bears a passing resemblance to the actual definition. I never could quite pin you down on what you meant, so I'll have to grant that whatever it is you do mean by ""by default"" might apply here as well.","expelled-expelled","10:01 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","46"

I really do think that most peoples' understanding of the phrase 'by default' is what happens 'automatically' if nothing is done in intervention. (e.g. ' bones tend to fossilize by default over millions of years. '; e.g. ' weeds will come up in the yard by default sooner or later. ' ) That's the way I use it as well. But hey, if that's not the way most people view the phrase, then I'm sorry. But for this case, to circumvent you being able to pick out one phrase to quibble over rather than address the point as a whole and ignoring other aspects of it ... forget I said ""by default"", here, for the sake of simplicity. I'll rephrase the sentence and omit that line: ""My point is that no one in monotheism likely set up ""undetectability"" with any intention. (as I said, ""not by any action by 'monotheism' or religious people to do so""--i.e. make it undetectable.)

Hm, I guess can I sorta see your point here in that the people who began believing in such gods likely didn't DELIBERATELY set it up so that such Gods would not be detectable by science, etc.","expelled-expelled","12:42 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","48"

"03-29-2008","11082",4,"None","None","None","thelmoose","306979","Even if using the word intention, I think it is still wrong. I think you may consider it this way (belied by the fact that you used the phrase ""by default"") because you are looking at it through your own point of view, as though yours is ""the default"" way of looking at it, and thus your god simply is the way he is. You forget that gods are created by people. People ascribe all sorts of attributes to their deities and do it very deliberately. The god of the Christians that was co-opted from the Jews (and he was not always undetectable in the OT) has been deemed to be undetectable because the god is considered to be beyond comprehension. The mysterious nature of God is a very convenient way of imposing all sorts of arbitrary guff as rules that cannot be questioned because they come from God. Now I would agree that there was likely no single decision in which anyone picked ""undetectable"" from the menu when custom designing his god, but people always custom design their gods nonetheless, but over generations and centuries. And they continue to change constantly as the times change. For example, the Christian god is very different today than he was a few hundred years ago, when we thought he was more involved in disease, weather, the winning side in a war, whatever. (Of course there are oodles of Christian sects today and they all have a slightly different flavor of God as well.) No, being undetectable is a very important quality to have in your deity if you want him to be mysterious and you want to use him to explain any old arbitrary thing you like. In addition, it keeps your god from being accountable.","expelled-expelled","03:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","50"

Remember--Christianity claim is that God came in the form of a tangible human being. I think these religions just came about in their own way, with no intention AT ALL of making them undetectable. I attribute that to changes over the last few hundred years to be Christianity returning to what it was more originally--sans the use of it politically by greedy kings. (And even in those times, there were pockets of the benevolent original religion still being secured in places like monasteries.) Naturally, there's going to be an ebb and flow of how true to something people are going to be, throughout such a span as centuries and centuries.","expelled-expelled","06:14 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","51"

Read carefully, I already said it. By intention, I mean believers intended to believe what they want and fashion the god so it fits. Gods follow beliefs. If anyone actually thought they were consciously and purposefully creating myths, that wouldn't be much of a religion, now would it? Myths are not created with forethought, but the results end up being how a culture intends them to be. Our gods always end to be just like we want them. With respect to your comment about Jesus, christians actively relate to him today, but he is not all that detectable today now is he? There never was a Christianity until Christ died and became undetectable. Right, Christianity today is just like it was originally. You go on believing that if it makes you feel better. Can you imagine a single practitioner of Christianity who ever did not proclaim that? Does anyone anywhere anytime think they are practicing a faith that is different from what Christ had in mind?","expelled-expelled","06:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","52"

Your idea means that they also would have made up a god that supposedly wipes them out if they don't believe in him for too long, or punishes them for things like eating bacon. Why would someone not make up a more friendly god for themselves as people, if our gods always end up to be just like we want them? It gets to where it makes less sense to explain it as made up than it does for not have just been made up 'custom made.' Well that depends. I see absolutely no reason why you couldn't call the disciples following Christ around PRE-death as being 'Christianity' as well. Geez, now who's favoring the abstract for only concrete terms?? I didn't say "" Christianity today is just like it was originally "" at all. Sorry, but the idea that any religious person may think they are true to their original religion and have the True version in no way proves that monotheistic religions were created with ANY intent to be 'undetectable.' Anyway, we've gotten way off-topic. I'll respond to this in the religion forum if you want to continue it.","expelled-expelled","07:42 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","53"
"03-30-2008","11082",4,"None","None","None","Ripskar","307003","IIRC the bible itself contains a good demonstration of detectable and undetectable deities; At some point one character finds himself in a place where people worship a dragon, which they keep in a room. The bible character goes in, sees the dragon and kills it. Seems detectable enough. During the Roman occupation the romans storm the temple and enter the Holy of Holies to find out what the Jewish god actually is, and find an empty room. Kind of Zen, but you can read anything into this, from the ethereal to the prosaic empty promises. Why would anyone design a myth? Control, see AiG. Why would they make up an unfriendly god? Control, power, essentially you have a perfect protection racket, if someone doesn't pay up you can even incite a mob to beat them into submission.","expelled-expelled","07:54 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","54"

So you have basically two choices here - either they made up a god that doesn't let them eat bacon and wipes them out if they don't believe in him for too long, or their IS a god (the god of all Christians) that IS like that. As to your question on why not make up a more friendly god, isn't it obvious? Making up the cranky, despotic God of the Bible gives the intercessors between said God and the people a HUGE amount of power over the people (who fear said God and will follow most anything that is told them that the God commands as they KNOW that if they don't believe in him too long they will get wiped out). Never heard of ""protection""? Go look that up in the context of gangs and hte mob and you'll see what I mean.","expelled-expelled","12:53 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","56"
