"04-15-2008","11082",6,"marc9000","308672","It was very thoroughly done in my formal debate with Peeling. I'm sure however, like obvious_child and others, since I ""lost"", that makes anything I said absolutely worthless. That's like saying since the Patriots lost the superbowl, they CANNOT play football in any way, shape or form. Since nothing I said was worth anything in the formal debate, how about if I repost what I quoted Kenneth Miller as saying in post #1 of that debate? Or how about if I repost what Peeling said in post #3 of that debate; ""Many shades of meaning"" - ""extending Darwinian thinking"". In post #4 I referenced how another thread on these forums quickly moved from biological evolution to geology and paleontology, in the interest of attacking religion. So you may say that I haven't shown it, but what I've done is let others show it for me. You can call it the ""fallacy of equivocation"" if you want. I call it ""REALITY"". ""April 16th"" - ""Godwin's law"", are you and electrolyte speaking in codes now?","trebor","308729","Are you really that ignorant, and are you really that unable to look things up?? Well, I suppose you are, considering your arguments. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law In my opinion, Expelled uses the reductio ad Hitlerum form. It just is despicable stupidity . Godwin's Law (also known as Godwin's Rule of Nazi Analogies)[1] is an adage formulated by Mike Godwin in 1990. The law states:[2][3] ""As a Usenet discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one."" Godwin's Law is often cited in online discussions as a caution against the use of inflammatory rhetoric or exaggerated comparisons, and is often conflated with fallacious arguments of the reductio ad Hitlerum form. The rule does not make any statement whether any particular reference or comparison to Hitler or the Nazis might be appropriate, but only asserts that one arising is increasingly probable. It is precisely because such a comparison or reference may sometimes be appropriate, Godwin has argued[4] that overuse of Nazi and Hitler comparisons should be avoided, because it robs the valid comparisons of their impact. Although in one of its early forms Godwin's Law referred specifically to Usenet newsgroup discussions,[5] the law is now applied to any threaded online discussion: electronic mailing lists, message boards, chat rooms, and more recently blog comment threads and wiki talk pages.","expelled-expelled","11:07 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","78"

Remember Marc asked contemptuously if the Pope (using his former name) was the leader of Catholicism. If he had bothered to plug the Cardinal's pre-Pope name into Google, he would have his answer.

I'm going to flame you for not seeing the movie, which may not be available where you are, thus I'm attacking you for not spending considerable sums of time and money to go find a theater showing it but I'm not even going to bother to read links given to me even though all the effort I need to do is click on the link!

"04-16-2008","11082",6,"marc9000","308871","I could have known it from the links I posted in #58, or the advertisments and promotions I've been hearing. Just because eugenics precedes Darwinism doesnt mean Darwinism couldnt further support it. Logic? Because evolution lovers dont like to see it associated with past societal problems. They want to live in/establish a society with evolution as its base. A society with church and state separated. Logic? No, because of the inferior way he may have thought they evolved. When the truth comes out, the name calling really gets going, doesnt it? Its better than attempting to debate the details of a movie with no intention of actually watching it. How can you back up what you say with no first hand information? NOTHING but second hand information from your prophet Dawkins? Without first hand information on it. Do you rip lots of things with little information on them? I'm not nearly as concerned with filmmakers who are dishonest hacks as I am with scientists who are dishonest hacks. It can call into question the reliability of science if some Darwinist scientists are discriminating and helping get fired other scientists who don't share their atheist religion, who ask questions about Darwinism that they find uncomfortable. Uh, it didn't come from me. I condensed and put into my words what was contained in one of my links from post #58. I know, hes a bestselling author and is well respected, in spite of the fact that he misapplies science to the degree that he believes it proves that God does not exist. If only you could show that ID attempts to prove the existance of a specific God to the same degree. Too bad you can't. Wow, that one soared WAY over your head. I was talking about creationists who question if ID is the answer to the problem. (oppose the influx- I thought you'd get it) You could read the following link, though I'm guessing you probably won't. You should love the title though; The failure of intelligent design Ill bet Collin wishes he would have said that!! He musta forgot! How do you know what he signed? Were you there, looking over his shoulder? The intimacy and support between gang posters just reached new heights! He did? He addressed what Dembski said, and how it blended with Darwinist teaching? Which post? Who knows, maybe it will be short of a lie or two since Myers didn't make it into the screening. So in writing books called The God Delusion and heartily endorsing the one with HOW SCIENCE SHOWS THAT GOD DOES NOT EXIST on its cover, we can say that Dawkins MISAPPLIES much of what he knows about science, and puts it forward as a philosophy. Remember what Kenneth Miller said? Evolution almost begs for extrapolation. We clearly see that Dawkins, and many others give it what it begs for. When the subject of ID comes up in the courts, its discarded mainly because it has the potential to beg for religious extrapolation. Its thrown out because it has that potential (separation of church and state) even though evolution is proven to actually do it, that is, combine atheism and state. Does DAWKINS use terms incorrectly, in his book The God Delusion? Why is he a best selling author and well respected, if he misapplies science to his personal worldview, and forwards it as science? Why are some ID promoters not permitted to do the same thing in public education? Name calling, and thinly veiled four letter words are violations of the terms of service also. Which one of us do you think violates the terms of service more often? If you think I do, please report me.","electrolyte","308878","Try again. Those links don't mention Nazism or eugenics. The only sites that have been posted that discuss those topics are the ones ripping on the argumentum ad Hitlerum. Ah, so Darwinism isn't a necessary condition for eugenics, even though the movie says it is. Thanks for admitting this. Thank you for also failing to support the argument that Darwinism has anything to do with eugenics. Even if it were true that Darwinism supported eugenics, how is this evidence that Darwinism is false? (This is like saying that because we despise Nazism, the Holocaust must not have happened.) How is arguing that Darwinism supports eugenics supporting the idea that Darwinists censor dissent? Answer: there is no reason. It's a propaganda piece. You're not familiar with your history, are you? Can you show where Hitler made this argument anywhere? No, you can't: YOU'RE MAKING SH*T UP AGAIN . The truth that I mistakenly duplicated a link? You know, you might have a position to complain if I posted the link both times, but I didn't. Your overactive persecution complex may need some psychiatric attention, marc. I stand by my big baby comment because all you're doing is whining like a baby. First, no, it's actually not. I have plenty of evidence for the claims I'm presenting: numerous reviews mention these things. I'm not making them up, or buying into a single review in favor of several others that don't say the same thing. Second, it's not nothing but secondhand information from a single source: numerous reviews mention these things. I have plenty of information, and it's corroborated information. Why do you think we're not allowed to form opinions about things unless we have firsthand information? Were you around when the earth was formed? No? Therefore, by your logic, you can't come to any conclusions? Kenneth Miller rips on these ID hacks. Does that make him an atheist? C'mon, say it again, marc. Call Miller an atheist. Please attack his science as unscientific and explain how it is unscientific. For that matter, pick anybody's scientific article and show how it's atheistic, positively rejecting the existence of all deities. Go ahead. I dare you. You can't. It's your persecution complex. Maybe I should stop bringing it up, because it's just not nice to make fun of psychiatric problems. Is this a touchy subject that I should avoid, marc? Or is it not really a mental oddity, and I can continue ripping on you for accusing 99.9% of the scientific community of being frauds without any evidence? So you're allowed to repeat as truth idiotic assertions and then pass them off as somebody else's? No, marc. We're not XXXXXX. You said that the producers may have expelled Myers because he was a potential political issue but that RICHARD DAWKINS HIMSELF would have less of a political effect. I'm sorry, there's just no way to soften this: that's just plain dumb. Even YOU know it's dumb, because before this, you rarely even mentioned Myers, but you always railed against Dawkins as the head of some sort of evil atheist political push. But, you know, use that as your defense all you want. Insist that you wouldn't make such an incredibly stupid claim, but that you believe that these groundbreaking hero filmmakers of yours would much such an incredibly stupid claim. Either way, you and your position don't look too good, do they? You're either lying about what he says or lying about what you know about what he says. He says nothing of the sort. In fact, he has repeatedly explained that science strictly cannot disprove the existence of a deity. It doesn't attempt to prove the existence of a specific God. Way to make sh*t up again, marc. ID's followers usually think that ID proves a specific God. But I can show that ID isn't science, and I can show that ID even as pseudoscience fails miserably. It didn't soar over my head; I called you on your conspiracy theory nutjobbery. Miller does oppose the influx. It is inexcusable for you to suggest otherwise. But integrity was never your strong point, was it? ""The problem with evolution is not that it is unscientific but that it is routinely taught in textbooks and in the classroom in an atheist way. Textbooks frequently go beyond the scientific evidence to make metaphysical claims about how evolution renders the idea of a Creator superfluous."" Poppycock. Maybe some reading books try to make this case, but I have never seen a textbook for schools that does this. NEVER . HOLY PERSECUTION COMPLEX, BATMAN! You truly are pathetic, marc. Several of the links made it clear that the producers required the audience to sign confidentiality agreements. You're so persecuted that you now think I'm ""intimately"" aware of what Collin does. What a troll. #76 . Can't you read? Does this mean that the site won't be able to cram all of the filmmaker's lies onto their site, or are you accusing the site's authors of lying? If the latter, please provide evidence of this assertion. We've already discussed Stenger's book and how it explicitly claims not to disprove all gods, just the conceptualizations of god that would produce testable effects. That you refuse to understand the plain words used to illustrate this doesn't change this fact. I recommend you take up Peeling's newest challenge about the planet Zod. Right, because the basic concept makes so much sense even just on its face: those organisms that are best capable of producing organisms that can reproduce will become prominent. If you actually paid attention to what Dawkins says instead of pretending that you know what he says, you'd know that Dawkins actually argues against misapplications of Darwinian ideas like eugenics and social Darwinism. So, once again, you're fabricating a position so that you can argue against it. No it's not; it's discarded because it is religiously motivated. It therefore fails the Lemon test and is unconstitutional. Even if the courts didn't strike it down as unconstitutional, the vast majority of scientist would argue against teaching it in science classes because it's not science. Even if science teachers refused to teach it because it's not science, I'd argue that the specific arguments behind the ID movement aren't even worthy of discussion in a course like comparative religion. Lie. Evolution does no such thing, troll. Which term does Dawkins use incorrectly? He doesn't, which you'd know if you actually read anything for yourself instead of swallowing the rightwing nutjob tripe whole. Why must you continue to troll by asking presumptuous and fallacious questions? Permitted to do what? Misapply pseudoscience? Why do you think? You do nothing but troll around, fabricating positions to argue against and pretending that you know things that actually aren't true. The TOS also say that posts should be informative, not disinformative. You're in no position to complain, although I'll be happy to defend my actions should admin come calling.","expelled-expelled","09:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","85"
