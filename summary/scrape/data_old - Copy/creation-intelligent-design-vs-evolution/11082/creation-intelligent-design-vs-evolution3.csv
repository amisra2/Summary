If you're being serious, how is that a valid claim?","Collin","306729","Statement: God made the earth with the appearance that it is 4.5 billion years old.

"03-25-2008","11082",3,"marc9000","306708","Is the wall between science and religion of the same height as the wall between science and atheism?","trebor","306747","Yes, it is. You might have some individual scientists who make conclusions, but science it self says nothing about the existence or non existence of god/gods. It might have something to say about such things as 'world wide flood'. However, it goes where the evidence leads it, and does not care about anything but the evidence. It might have something to say about claims about the real world by religion, but it will go where the evidence leads. [/QUOTE] The only claim that atheism makes is that there are no god/gods. That particular statement is not testable.","expelled-expelled","08:06 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","32"

Certainly a statement which is testable has more utility than one that isn't. In fact, untestable statements are pretty useless in any serious discussion. So if, as seems to be the case, Collin thinks a ""valid"" statement is simply one that can't be proven wrong, I'd say that that is faint praise for a statement. Being valid, in that sense, by no means elevates a statement to the point where it should be given any sort of real consideration. Personally, I would go with a more standard definition of valid. ""Well grounded in logic and truth"", for example. By that standard, the statement in question is clearly not valid.","expelled-expelled","09:19 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","35"
"03-25-2008","11082",3,"None","None","None","jyoshu","306755","I don't see how the assertion that God created the universe and/or earth with the appearance of age can be any more than ANY statement about God. Even as a theist, I wouldn't make the assertion. It's still more plausible that the earth actually is 4.5 billion years old than the idea it's just made to look that way (but really isn't). And the idea that it's a faux look of age brings up all kinds of other issues.","expelled-expelled","09:31 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","36"

As far as we can tell, science disproves Creation, but it could be wrong, and contrary to what mark would have us believe, scientists aren't out to disprove God because most scientists recognize that that would be impossible.","expelled-expelled","10:57 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","37"

As you say, it's can't really deal with whether or not the God was behind what science science reveals happened. It certainly can give evidence as to HOW it happened, though, historically speaking. If you're just trying to say that science can't really disprove God then I agree, though the question of God isn't really a scientific one to begin with, IMO.","expelled-expelled","11:16 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","38"

It comes across as slightly childish and renders the subject moot. Personally I feel that we have to go with the information we have rather than any untestable hypothetical; Do you trust anyone who doesn't trust their own sences?","expelled-expelled","11:48 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","40"

If it were something in the realm of the directly detectable --something that could be 'put in a box'--it wouldn't actually be God (Other than cases where God reveals himself, of which many religious people already claim to have experienced in various ways). So that definition is automatically there by default simply on the basis of the idea there is a God.","expelled-expelled","12:37 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","41"

The defintion of a diety generally encompasses things like being extremely powerful, all knowing, things of that nature. But undetectable? No. Many religious traditions include tales of Gods coming down and mingling with people all the time. Read the Illiad for an example from our own heritage. Gods can choose to be invisible of course, but that's not the same thing. There's nothing inherent with being a God that requires one to be undetectable; that qualification is pretty much reserved for modern day monotheisms, just as Ripskar said.","expelled-expelled","03:07 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","43"

I can only think of a very few ""deities"" that are ""invisible""/""undetectable"" according to their worshippers (on second thought, I can't come up with any off the top of my head). Even Christianity doesn't completely have that - God is supposed to have appeared to several people in the OT in several forms (burning bush, his glory, etc. - although that could be seen as ""revealing himself"") and then the most OBVIOUS - Jesus: God in human form. I actually can't think of any religion that keeps their God totally invisible and undetectable ""by default"".","expelled-expelled","03:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","44"
