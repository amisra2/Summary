If fossils aren't dated, then why would the scientist at Cambridge date it and not the rocks around it?","pandion","338317","You're not paying attention. The scientists at Cambridge didn't date the fossil itself. Most people who have an interest in the topic have at least a basic knowledge of what is being talked about. Thus, when a scientist says that the fossil was dated, anyone who knows at least the basics understands that it was not the fossil that was directly dated. This presents a problem when someone with no understanding of the subject reads that scientists dated a fossil. Later that same ignorant person reads his own cut and paste and finds that it was the rock around the fossil that was dated. That's how he arrived at his assertion that the same specimen was dated by the same machine 5 times and yielded 5 different dates. Notice the failure to support that assertion when asked several times, and then citing a cut and paste that doesn't say anything about the same specimen. Isn't that a remarkable lack of integrity? Not enough self respect to stand up and admit his error. At any rate, the fossil under discussion is KNM ER 1470 , found at Koobi Fora on the east side of Lake Turkana in Kenya in 1972. The fossil itself has never been directly dated because that would be impossible. In fact, the rock in which it was embedded has never been dated. That isn't what the scientists at Cambridge dated. It is sedimentary rock, very soft and weathered at the site. The fossil was weathering out of the soil. As anyone who has even made a slight effort to learn the basics knows, sedimentary rock cannot be dated radiometrically. The reason is that the sediment is obviously composed of particles of much older rock that has weathered, been transported to the site, and then re-lithified. The rocks wouldn't yield any sort of meaningful date in relation to the fossil and when it was buried. Most fossils are buried in sedimentary rock and thus neither the rock nor the fossils are datable. The fossil itself is rock that was formed as the organic material was replaced by minerals over hundreds of thousands of years. Only creationists would believe that scientists try to date such material. So what was dated, you ask? Volcanic material from a single stratum known as the KBS Tuff. The original testing was preliminary, done on two different samples from near the site, some volcanic ash and some feldspar crystals. The method used on each was K-AR, i.e., Potassium/Argon dating. When rocks are hot argon gas is able to escape easily. When the rock cools, argon is trapped. Thus, new volcanic flows contain no argon gas. However, the rocks contain potassium, of which a known percentage is K-40. K-40 is unstable and decays to Ar-40. The K-Ar ratio, when measured establishes the radiometric date of the sample. KNM ER 1470 was found in sedimentary rock below the KBS Tuff and is thus, older than the tuff. So you see, even from the first, there was no dating of the same sample 5 times. But the problem was in the collecting of samples. Several samples from the tuff returned varying dates between 1.9 my and 2.6 my. In fact, samples from the tuff were dated at least 41 times. Studies of the area show that the disparity of dates was caused by three factors: difficulty in identifying the correct tuff horizontally across the area, contamination of the tuff by older volcanic deposits, and ""overprinting"", specific events of heat, pressure, or chemical environment that alter the composition of the exposed minerals (for example, by allowing argon gas to escape). Subsequent work has indicated that the tuff is about 1.8 mya. But the youngest date for the KBS Tuff was around 1.8 my, which means that KNM ER 1470 is around 2 mya. Creationists have to deny this since it does not fit a 6,000 year old earth.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","08:35 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","106"
"12-30-2008","12141",8,"None","None","None","tonechild","338323","Thanks pandion. To put it in short, the fossil itself was never dated, and because we date the rocks around fossils everytime we want to find out how old the fossil is, we call that ""dating the fossil"" - got it. So the rock wasn't dated 5 times, but 41, and also, there were problems with the rocks that later got sorted out. It got sorted out because they used different methods to date the rocks, which were better suited to the environment. Of course, since a fossil was already exposed, it makes sense that there would be contamination, not to mention the lava rocks too. I've already known that you can't date lava rocks.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","09:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","107"

"12-31-2008","12141",8,"tonechild","338323","I've already known that you can't date lava rocks.","pandion","338341","Actually, lava is one of the most reliable sources of datable specimens, as long as you are careful not to date mafic inclusions. Creationists like to date mafic inclusions (unmelted rocks from earlier eruptions that have been included in an eruption). That is why the KBS Tuff was thought to be reliable. At the time, the scientists didn't expect contamination. The KBS Tuff isn't lava. It is volcanic ash that was spread much farther than the lava. My brother lived in Billings, MT when Mount St. Helens erupted. Volcanic ash covered everything. But it wasn't lava. But that layer of volcanic ash will be datable by geologists some thousands of years in the future. Except when erosion of superimposed layers exposes the volcanic layer. Then, when another volcanic eruption occurs, the ash falls on previous volcanic ash. It confuses radiometric dating. Such seems to be the case at the Koobi Fora. Really hot lava, when it was extruded, is really good for certain types of radiometric dating. When it comes to relatively cool lava, like in Hawaii, one must be careful to avoid mafic inclusions.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","02:07 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","110"

I found a couple of trees running through 2 distinct coal seams. One was 30' tall another was 12'. The following website refers to the most popular of all - our own petrified forest. If you go to the site, consider figure 6. Google Image Result for http://www.grisda.org/origins/images/24017-12.jpg Petrified wood and trees are found in numerous locations around the world, but the Yellowstone Petrified Forests are unusual because of the many levels stacked one upon another. In 1960 Erling Dorf of Princeton University studied the Amethyst Mountain Fossil Forest and counted 27 levels.8 I have plotted 31 levels on Mount Hornaday on the west side of the Soda Butte Creek Valley (Figure 4). The greatest sequence of superimposed fossil forest levels is located in the Specimen Creek area where 65 or more levels can be counted (Table 1). Other areas with fewer levels are Mt. Norris on the east side of Soda Butte Creek Valley (5 levels), Specimen Ridge flanking the Lamar Valley (15 levels), and Cache Creek (26 levels).9 Multiple levels are also seen at Miller Creek northeast of the Lamar Valley, in Tom Minor Basin (including Ramshorn Peak), and in the Stratified Primitive Area. Scattered trees and petrified wood can be found throughout the northern region of Yellowstone Park and other surrounding areas.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","06:13 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","117"
"12-31-2008","12141",8,"The Barbarian","338367","I'm not aware of an entire tree being fossilized. Usually, it's just a portion of the trunk. It's going on in a reservoir near me, as muck accumulates over trees submerged when a dam produced a lake. In the right conditions, the environment is hypoxic, and not much rotting takes place. If it's not disturbed for a long time, we get petrified trees, usually polystrate, because the process goes on for several periods of time. Say a grove of trees is flooded by some kind of lake-forming event (landlslide say) and then over a number of decades, several floods deposit layers of sediment. Eventually, the land changes, dries, and the muck compacts to rock. Standing polystrate tree fossils result. Not very common, but they do exist.","Smallax","338438","I have heard that explanation b4 and the trouble is that the root balls could not have formed and fossilized at the same level as their neighbors' stems. If a mudslide came into your area and buried the trunk upto 12' you could not expect a root ball to form in the 4-10 foot level above original grade. [That assumes the original trees survived the mudslide and continued to mineralized.]","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","06:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","118"
