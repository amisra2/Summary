Whether it is so-called, vestigal organs, or what is happening in the cells. That is why communication is so tense. Creation of life advocates, recognize that built in redundancy is useful for any single organism so that it may easily adapt to many different and varied environments. Evolutionism on the other hand uses all of our current technology in microbiology to sort out 'real dna' from 'junk dna'. They assume that as evolution progressed - lots of elements of life are no longer useful. What this means is: that we will never figure out the intricate workings of the genome, no matter how much we learn about it. That is because we refuse to connect all the dots. When you began on a false premise you arrive at a false conclusion.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","09:32 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1"
"12-23-2008","12141",1,"The Barbarian","337793","Could you rephrase that in English? There is a lot of that. Many mutations are recessive and a population over time accumulates a lot of genetic variation that can become useful if the environment changes. The founder population of lizards, for example, could have had at most, 20 alleles for any gene locus, since each lizard can only have 2. The new ones evolved by mutation. Sometimes, we can even observe that happening, or trace the mutation back to a known ancestor. Would you like to learn about it? . You're a little confused about that. It's all real DNA. Some of it just doesn't code for anything. But some parts of non-coding DNA (which you call ""junk"") has other functions besides coding for proteins. . That happens, too. For example, our gene for vitamin C is broken and no longer works. . In my lifetime, we've made huge strides, but there's a lot more to learn.. It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology.","Smallax","337820","I'd be happy to. The concept that I was trying to move forward was: the idea that - when we see a cecal valve develop, for example, we assume that it is newly engineered data to react to the new environment. Big question mark! My point is that - the lizard was designed to survive in a neighborhood where eating leaves, was its best chance of survival. So that if a cecal valve became necessary the lizard was ready to go. Having the built-in redundancy makes this possible without missing a beat. Yes. I would. [As long as I can exercise 'critical thinking', along the way w/out personal attacks.] I never considered dna to be junk. I was using that term, [junk dna] from what I had read in various 'scientific' literature. I recognize that any dna is real dna, because it is exists. I have heard it said that it is the most complex molecule in the universe. So far be it from me to call it 'junk'. That's an interesting subject, I had not heard of that b4. Did our bodies once produce Vitamin C?. Agreed. That is why a sensible interpretation, of new data, is so important! That, my friend, is where the wisdom of interpretation - makes sense of the data. For exa.: I really have no idea what the Federal GAO has for data, but, The wisdom of giving 850 Billion to a few bankers rather than the people who actually fuel the engine of this economy - eludes me. We have a large and powerful machine, but who is driving? Very important IMHO.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","05:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","3"
"12-24-2008","12141",1,"The Barbarian","337837","...That's the point. It wasn't designed, and it was evolved to be a carnivore. ""Ready to go"", in the sense that living things are equipped with a means of making small errors which are used by natural selection to make new structures. ... The new ones evolved by mutation. Sometimes, we can even observe that happening, or trace the mutation back to a known ancestor. Would you like to learn about it? .. We thought it would take roughly a million years for bacteria to evolve enzymes capable of digesting nylon (because the compound is so different than any they were able to digest) but it took less than a century. . Barbarian observes: It's remarkable then, how much progress we've made. You may or may not approve of the theory, but it works very well at learning more about biology. And, as you may have noticed, we've been very successful at interpreting the data. We've learned to do a lot of things as a result. One of the most important reasons scientists accept the theory is that it works.","Smallax","337880","So you really do believe that organisms ""are equipped with a means of making small errors that allow natural selection"" turn a reptile to a bird and a monkey into a man? To be ""equipped"" means there is a design feature. You are betraying your belief system. The errors can only be arbitrary and random and the organism is not equipped to function in any predetermined fashion. In the following example that you provided: What is the context of the word 'truncated'? The way I read it - it is talking about a truncated string of code or something. What was truncated? ... *more than 100 LPL gene mutations have been identified, the majority of which cause loss of enzymatic function. In contrast to this, the naturally occurring LPLS447X variant is associated with increased lipolytic function and an anti-atherogenic lipid profile and can therefore be regarded as a gain-of-function mutation. This notion combined with the facts that 20% of the general population carries this prematurely truncated LPL...* Were they able to show a previously non-existing code that mutated on a gene somewhere and created this new enzyme activity? It sounds to me that this ""new"" enzymatic activity came from non-coding dna switching on a gene to produce it. That is what one would expect to find. ...*Two new enzyme activities, 6-aminohexanoate cyclic dimer hydrolase and 6-aminohexanoate dimer hydrolase, were detected in the adapted strains.*... What is the ""Scientific Method"" of evolutionary research in contrast to the ""Scientific Method"" of Creation research? And why is your method superior?","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","09:52 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","5"
"12-24-2008","12141",1,"Barbarian","None","The evidence shows that reptiles did give rise to birds, but nothing shows monkeys became humans. Monkeys are far to evolved in their own way to give rise to us.","Archangel","337884","Got any evidence that this is a fact? How can monkeys be far too evolved to give rise to man, when #1, they share so much common DNA and #2, they are listed as a lower life form than we are? And #3, we were once allegedly tree dwellers exactly like modern monkeys still are? Nothing in their social construct reflects them being too evolved in any way. In fact it is said that prior to us becoming land dwellers, we lived in trees just as monkeys still do. So please clarify what you mean by saying that monkeys are too evolved for us to have evolved from them as it makes no sense. It seems to me, if you were being consistent, you would say that monkeys are on the same evolutionary track as Man, except that they are still in the tree bound stage of evolution. What makes no sense though is how man jumped so far ahead of these other primates which have never evolved past the level of lower life forms to evolve critical thought, the ability to reason, complex communication or sophisticated creativity even though they have existed side by side with Man, the most sophisticated environmental pressure imaginable as we have dominated every lower species for allegedly hundreds of thousands of years by now. It makes no sense that our very presence wouldn't have been a catalyst for promoting their evolution toward higher and more sophisticated reasoning and creativity. Yet it hasn't had any impact on their need to evolve at all.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","10:45 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","7"
"12-24-2008","12141",1,"The Barbarian","337882","...Yep. (I'm assuming that by ""belief system"", you mean a methodology of gaining knowledge) Science depends on evidence. I have to use a different belief system for understanding the supernatural, of course. Both belief systems are valid in their proper places. ...In science, a scientific method actually exists. There is no scientific method in creationism. Religion cannot use the scientific method.","Smallax","337890","Actually belief system is a system that contructs the way you look at anything. I have an idea and I then reference what I believe to determine whether the idea is true or false or insignificant etc. If I believe that - in one observed experiment there were 100+ destructive mutations while producing a percieved benefit from 1 mutation is progress; then I need to defend that belief system with rational logic or something else. Especially if that 1 mutation with the percieved benefit was the result of losing information. To me life goes on like that [generation after generation] losing information and facing destruction of genetic material would mean. Decline to extinction. Not new and wonderful living things. The belief system has nothing to do with the scientific method as you say. It has everything to do with interpreting the results.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","11:20 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","8"

LPL is the designation for a gene that encodes Lipoprotein Lipase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes lipids in lipoproteins. The actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide. One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional. In fact, it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure. Other truncations result in non-functional enzymes.","built-redundancy-vs-vestigal-organs","01:44 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","11"
