I don't know if it has been mentioned before, but Pahu's #### seems to be cut and paste from Walt Brown's silly site. I'm sure that I don't have to point out that Pahu never defends any of his posts. Of course, he probably lacks the education and intelligence to do so. Somehow he thinks that posting superstitious nonsense is somehow pleasing to his god.","evidence-creation","01:21 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","76"

Their relative velocities, as inferred by the redshifts of their light, are so high that these clusters should be flying apart, because each clusters visible mass is much too small to hold its galaxies together gravitationally (a). Because galaxies within clusters are so close together, they have not been flying apart for very long. A similar statement can be made concerning many stars in spiral galaxies and gas clouds that surround some galaxies (b). These stars and gas clouds have such high relative velocities that they should have broken their gravitational bonds long ago if they were billions of years old. If the redshift of starlight always indicates a stars velocity, then a billion-year-old universe is completely inconsistent with what is observed. If redshifts can be caused by phenomena other than a stars velocity, much of current astronomical thinking is wrong. These observations have led some to conclude, not that the universe is young, but that unseen, undetected mass is holding these stars and galaxies together. For this to work, the hidden mass, sometimes called dark matter, must be 10100 times greater than all visible mass, and the hidden mass must be in the right places. However, many experiments have shown that the needed missing mass does not exist (c). Some researchers are still searching, because the alternative is a young universe. a. In 1933 the late Fritz Zwicky pointed out that the galaxies of the Coma cluster are moving too fast: there is not enough visible mass in the galaxies to bind the cluster together by gravity. Subsequent observations verified this missing mass in other clusters. M. Mitchell Waldrop, The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe, Science, Vol. 219, 4 March 1983, p. 1050. b. Faye Flam, NASA PR: Hype or Public Education? Science, Vol. 260, 4 June 1993, pp. 14171418. It turns out that in almost every case the velocities of the individual galaxies are high enough to allow them to escape from the cluster. In effect, the clusters are boiling. This statement is certainly true if we assume that the only gravitational force present is that exerted by visible matter, but it is true even if we assume that every galaxy in the cluster, like the Milky Way, is surrounded by a halo of dark matter that contains 90 percent of the mass of the galaxy.

The measured orbital velocity of this ring allows the calculation of the mass of the two galaxies and any hidden mass. There was little hidden mass. Statistical analyses of 155 other small galactic groups also suggest that there is not enough hidden mass to hold them together. [See Stephen E.

This assumption may be grossly inaccurate. Projecting present processes and rates far back in time is more likely to produce errors than extrapolation over a much shorter time. Furthermore, a much better understanding usually exists for dating clocks that show a young Earth and a young universe. This contrary evidence understandably disturbs those who have always been told that the Earth is billions of years old. Can you imagine how disturbing such evidence is to confirmed evolutionists? creationscience.com","evidence-creation","12:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","79"

Most people do not realize that the volume of water on earth is ten times greater than the volume of all land above sea level. Most of the earths mountains consist of tipped and buckled sedimentary layers. Because these sediments were initially laid down through water as nearly horizontal layers, those mountains must have been pushed up after the sediments were deposited. If the effects of compressing the continents and buckling up mountains were reversed, the oceans would again flood the entire earth. Therefore, the earth has enough water to cover the smaller mountains that existed before the flood. (If the solid earth were perfectly smooth, the water depth would be about 9,000 feet everywhere.)

Attempts to explain shells on mountain tops have generated controversy for centuries (a). An early explanation was that a global flood covered these mountains, allowing clams and other sea life to crawl far and high. However, as Leonardo da Vinci wrote (b), under the best conditions, clams move too slowly to reach such heights, even if the flood lasted hundreds of years; besides, the earth does not have enough water to cover these mountains. Others said that some sea bottoms sank, leaving adjacent sea bottoms (loaded with sea creatures) relatively highwhat we today call mountains. How such large subterranean voids formed to allow this sinking was never explained. Still others proposed that sea bottoms rose to become mountains. Mechanisms for pushing up mountains were also never satisfactorily explained. Because elevations on earth change slowly, some wondered if sea bottoms could rise miles into the air, perhaps over millions of years. However, mountain tops erode relatively rapidlyand so should fossils slowly lifted by them. Furthermore, mountain tops accumulate few sediments that might protect such fossils. Some early authorities, in frustration, said the animals grew inside rocksor the rocks simply look like clams, corals, fish, and ammonites. Some denied the evidence even existed. The means by which mountains were pushed up in hours during a global flood will soon be presented. The mechanism is simple, the energy and forces are sufficient, and supporting evidence (pages 99305) is voluminousnot just sea shells on mountains. a. Alan Cutler, The Seashell on the Mountaintop (New York: Dutton, 2003). Nothing is so high, nothing is so far from the sea that we cannot find [shells] of those creatures that only live in sea water.

During the period 1508 to 1515, Leonardo da Vinci carefully studied the shells he found high in the Italian mountains. He raised valid arguments against all the hypotheses that others were proposing to explain shells on mountains, but he offered no explanation of his own.
