"11-30-2007","10654",2,"Archangel","292039","From the link above: Creation's Tiny Mysteries The second most compelling evidence for instantaneous creation pertains to the spherical halos caused by the decay of a radioactive core. These halos are found by the trillions in all Precambrian granites, the foundation stones of the earth's crust. More particularly they are found in biotite, the mica portion of the granite. As a radioactive particle decays, it progresses through a well know set of elements and isotopes, emitting Beta or Alpha particles of given MeV (Million electron Volts). When alpha particles are emitted by a radioactive speck in a given substrate or material, the alpha particles ""run out of energy"" a certain distance away from the core and leave a ""damage"" sphere or ring (when cross-sectioned). See illustrations below. By measuring the diameter of the damaged ring, and also noting the various rings around a core, its fairly straightforward to determine what the exact center core particle was to begin with. Reviewing: By understanding the energy levels of particles being emitted from the radioactive core, and determining how far those ""energetic"" particles would travel in the material, (leaving a ""sphere"" of damage as the particles came to a halt), and slicing a halo and measuring the halo ring diameters under a microscope, and understanding the elements and isotopes that the core material progresses through as it radioactively decays, it is easily possible to accurately determine what the composition was of the original radioactive material encased in the substrate. Following are some illustrations of Polonium halos and photographs of actual cross-sections of halos of those isotopes. 210 Po Halo Cross Section Idealized three-dimensional illustration of a 210 Po halo obtained by slicing the halo through the center. Each halo ring is identified by the appropriate isotope and its alpha energy in MeV (Million electron Volts) 214 Po Halo Cross Section Idealized three-dimensional illustration of a 214 Po halo obtained by slicing the halo through the center.

Each halo ring is identified by the appropriate isotope and its alpha energy in MeV (Million electron Volts) Adapted from Creation's Tiny Mysteries by Robert V. Gentry. Published by Earth Science Associates, Knoxville, TN. Copyright Robert V. Gentry. All rights reserved. Robert Gentry, a government laboratory researcher discovered that many halos were caused by original (not secondary) particles of Polonium 210 (210Po), Polonium 214 and Polonium 218. The half-lives of the Polonium isotopes are as follows: Polonium 210 half-life = 138.4 days Polonium 214 half-life = 164 microseconds Polonium 218 half-life = 3 minutes The radioactivity of these cores are of course long extinct. Now here's the kicker. How could the Precambrian granites, which scientists state formed over millions of years, possibly contains evidence that would have taken only a few minutes to disappear? Gentry wondered too, and published his findings in some of the leading scientific journals, hoping there might be some adequate response. But there wasn't. The most common approach of the scientific community was to ignore the evidence and many journals refused to publish his work. There never was a satisfactory answer. There are only two ways that the phenomena of having a 3-minute half-life particle entrapped in granite could have occurred. the granite substrate surrounding the Polonium core particle was instantaneously formed around the particle (at least in under three minutes), or the substrate surrounded a non-radioactive Polonium core particle and sometime later, the particle became radioactive. The first option can only have come about through instantaneous creation. The second at some later event (such as the Fall of Adam) at which time the death causing process of radioactivity on earth may have begun. The first option seems the more reasonable of the two. God spoke and the land (granites included) instantly formed. God left His fingerprint inside these foundation stones and left evidence that will stand forever. For an excellent and full dissertation on these halos, get Robert Gentry's excellent book, Creation's Tiny Mysteries published by Earth Sciences Associates, Knoxville, Tennessee.","unkerpaulie","292095","this creates quite a task for people looking for god's fingerprints. why would god leave such cryptic and ambiguous evidence as the ""second most compeling"" case for his 6-day creation? wouldnt it be more reasonable that an all-powerful master of the universe leave his ""fingerprints"" in a more conspicuous place? its interesting that the only ""evidence"" creationists produce to support creation are the instances where they assume that science hasnt conclusively explained a phenomenon. just because you feel that the rings around these radioactive have an explanation that may have doubt about its definiteness, you leap at the opportunity to say ""see! scientists cant explain this! that means god did it!"" i'd say approximately 99.999% of believers have never even heard of this radiation-emitting polonium core particles, yet believe in creation. also, hinging your belief in creation on this single (and largely insignificant) piece of evidence is dangerous, because it will eventually be conclusively explained and demonstrated by science, and then you'll have to move on to the next physical phenomenon with a shady explanation. its not a good trend. at one time, lightning and volcanoes were also compelling pieces of evidence that creation was real and these phenomena were direct acts of god. inevitably, all of these have been explained by natural and sponateous forces of nature. your polonium core is heading down the same path. in fact, i'd be surprised if it hasnt already been conclusively explained by nature already, and youre simply refusing to admit it","evidence-creation","06:10 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","16"

"11-30-2007","10654",2,"Archangel","292037","The Male - Female Problem The simplest and most compelling argument for Creation is the male/female pairing issue. Abstract: If an animal mates with another animal not of its exact species, the result will be a sterile creature (e.g. a horse mating with a donkey produces a sterile mule). If animals of a given species mate and produce an abnormal offspring (i.e. a mutant), it also is sterile. Therefore, how could the macro evolutionary process advance? How could a ""mutant"" (i.e. advances in form) reproduce? It would first have to be fertile itself. It would have to find a sexually compatible mate who was also fertile during its relatively miniscule life span on the overall evolutionary time scale. Thirdly, their offspring would also have to be fertile and be able to continue the advance. So if single celled animals formed in the primordial soup and they were asexual (not have either male or female characteristics, but reproducing by themselves, how would they advance to a hermaphroditic state (having both male and female sexual organs) and then to the higher orders of animals which almost always have distinct male and female reproductive organs? All in-between states are sterile.","johnhanks","292138","There are so many misunderstandings and confusions here it is hard to know where to start. More or less true, and excellent evidence for evolution. The existence of varying degrees of reproductive isolation between related species is exactly what evolutionary theory would predict (but not at all what separate creation would predict). Patently untrue. Some mutant offspring may be sterile (it depends on the nature of the mutation), but it is not a necessary consequence and most will not be. Whether this is simple ignorance on the part of the writer, or a piece of sly conflation - slipping a blatant fallacy past us by attaching it to a reasonable proposal - it's hard to say. Either way, everything that follows is undone by the falseness of this premise. The assumption that separate sexes could evolve from asexual organisms only via hermaphroditism is unwarranted. The earliest manifestations of sexual reproduction were probably isogamous, as we see today in sundry protoctists such as Chlamydomonas . Selection pressure would soon push such organisms toward anisogamy, and ultimately heterogamy. Hermaphroditism - certainly self-fertilising hermaphroditism - is secondary to the emergence of separate sexes.","evidence-creation","12:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","30"
