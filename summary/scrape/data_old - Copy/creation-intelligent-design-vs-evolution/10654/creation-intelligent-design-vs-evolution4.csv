Comets also fragment frequently or crash into the Sun (b) or planets. Typical comets should disintegrate after several hundred orbits. For many comets this is less than 10,000 years. There is no evidence for a distant shell of cometary material surrounding the solar system, and there is no known way to add comets to the solar system at rates that even remotely balance their destruction. Actually, the gravity of planets tends to expel comets from the solar system rather than capture them (c). So, comets and the solar system appear to be less than 10,000 years old. a. Ron Cowen, Comets: Mudballs of the Solar System, Science News, Vol. 141, 14 March 1992, pp. 170171. b. Ray Jayawardhana, Keeping Tabs on Cometary Breakups, Science, Vol. 264, 13 May 1994, p. 907. c. Raymond A. Lyttleton, The Non-Existence of the Oort Cometary Shell, Astrophysics and Space Science, Vol. 31, December 1974, p. 393. If comet formation accompanies star formation, as evolutionists claim, then many comets should have been expelled from other stars. Some expelled comets should have passed through our solar system in recent years. No incoming comet has ever been observed with an interstellar (i.e. hyperbolic) orbit. [See Wetherill, p. 470.] For the last 150 years, the age of the Earth, as assumed by evolutionists, has been doubling at roughly a rate of once every 15 years. In fact, since 1900 this age has multiplied by a factor of 100! Evolution requires an old Earth, an old solar system, and an old universe. Nearly all informed evolutionists will admit that without billions of years their theory is dead. Yet, hiding the origins question behind a vast veil of time makes the unsolvable problems of evolution difficult for scientists to see and laymen to imagine. Our media and textbooks have implied for over a century that these almost unimaginable ages are correct. Rarely do people examine the shaky assumptions and growing body of contrary evidence. Therefore, most people today almost instinctively believe that the Earth and universe are billions of years old. Sometimes, these people are disturbed, at least initially, when they see the evidence. Actually, most dating techniques indicate that the Earth and solar system are youngpossibly less than 10,000 years old.","evidence-creation","02:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","46"

Whether they originate between Mars and Jupiter, Jupiter and Saturn or even further out is being studied. I know of no comets that originated in other star systems as far as we know. The theory that they have been perturbed and sent Sunward recently is perfectly plausible.","evidence-creation","06:13 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","49"

Well over 200 trans-Neptunian objects have been directly imaged by various means. All but Pluto have been found since 1992, and way over half have been found since 1998. I notice that of your references, one was published early in the year that the first (third if you count Pluto and Charon) was discovered, another was published two years later, and the third was published in 1974(!). MY GOD!! 1974! I also notice that none of them have anything to do with comet origin. Why on earth would an 'evolutionist' make such a claim? What does comet formation have to do with evolution? Wouldn't such a claim be more appropriate for an astrophysicist or a planetary physicist to make, rather than a biologist? Are you sure that you understand what you are discussing? Again, why would a so called 'evolutionist' make claims about the age of the earth. And, of course, calculations about the age of the earth were based on incomplete information. Once radioactive decay was discovered to be the source of the heat emitted from the earth, it was realized that the earth was quite old. I wasn't around in 1900, but I began studying evolutionary biology in the 1960, and what I learned about the age of the earth and the universe back then (not from evolution, but from the science published by astrophysicists, cosmologists, geophysicists, etc.) the age of the estimates of the age of the earth hasn't changed by a factor of 100. In fact it hasn't changed by a factor of 10. And we have learned that the age of the universe is younger than we thought, by about 6 billion years - making it now only 13.7 billion years old. Yes, it does. But determining that age is not a question answered by evolution. No. We know that evolution happens. What would be a problem would be to find the processes that made evolution happen as such incredible rates. There isn't any evidence that it can happen that fast. That's because nobody ever presents any of that contrary evidence. I am aware that young earthers base their opinion on shaky assumptions (the Bible says so), but no one seems to want to point out any of that growing body of contrary evidence. Do you want to take a stab at it? Better would if you would actually present evidence for a young earth and a miraculous creation from nothing rather than just posting your confused ideas about evolution. As well they might be. Would you mind pointing out some of it? I have never met anyone who has seen any of this evidence that you talk about. It is useless to keep claiming it exists without presenting it. Actually, that's just not true. Perhaps if you actually educated yourself about the topic. A good place to start would be Dalrymple's ""The Age of the Earth."" Maybe if you learned how and why such dating techniques work you wouldn't look so foolish.","evidence-creation","06:59 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","50"

I was hoping that at least one creationist wouldn't cut and run and would present some actual evidence that they keep claiming exists. For Pahu and anyone else interested in a couple of the concepts that Pahu misrepresents, you should consult Tim Thompson's web publications . For example, radiometric dating is covered in Tim's A Radiometric Dating Resource List , and the age of the universe and the earth is covered in his Creation Science the Age of the Universe and Stellar Evolution , and of course, Is the Earth Young? , which debunks 10 ""evidences"" commonly presented by creationists. I mention it lest Pahu wishes to answer the challenge with the sort of bunk that Tim has already answered. Wouldn't it be great if scientific illiterates such as Pahu would actually invest the effort to educate themselves before they tell us what science does and does not disprove?","evidence-creation","11:40 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","52"

Creationists like don't care what science actually says. Pahu got turned into ground beef, annihilated on every point, and faced total defeat on another forum to the point he just fled.
