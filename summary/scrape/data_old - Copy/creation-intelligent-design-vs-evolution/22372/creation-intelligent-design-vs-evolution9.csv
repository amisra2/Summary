It's not the Carl Sagan or Atheist particle, but THE GOD PARTICLE! Quote from story: ""The particle was named for Peter Higgs, one of the physicists who proposed its existence, but it later became popularly known as the "" God particle. "" Why is the Higgs boson - posited by an atheistic physicist nearly 50 years ago - called the 'God particle'? The answer is as simple as it is profound. The Higgs has been dubbed the ""God particle"" because scientists say it is powerful and everywhere critical to conferring mass on everything in the known universe, and to keeping the same together - and yet it has been so hard to find. Peter Higgs, the now 83-year-old physicist who first theorized the boson's existence 48 years ago, actually frowns upon the term. A modest man, Higgs is said to have cringed every time the term ""Higgs boson"" was used in his presence and studiously avoided using it. But as a self-proclaimed atheist, Higgs disliked the boson's other name, ""God particle"", even more.","Accipiter","472076","Why is the Higgs boson called the 'God particle'? - InterAksyon.com And by the way, you suck.","origin-life","06:51 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","125"

Why? Because the evidence we have has narrowed the options down long past the point where the involvement of a deity makes sense. To put it another way: the gaps have become too small for any god worth bothering with to fit in them. Once upon a time we didn't have a good enough grasp of zoology, geology, paleontology, astronomy etc to spot what is now obvious: all macroscopic life is related and descended from a common ancestor over millions of years. So we imagined ourselves created in our present forms and created great big gods to fill the void. These days the creator is subsisting on a diet of, what, UV radiation and free oxygen? Boiled any frogs lately? I just feel like we've given the god hypothesis enough chances - the kind of gods we concocted to start with at any rate. Genesis had the earth made in under a week and a man and woman siring the human race a few thousand years ago. Were that true, there's no reason at all why we couldn't just see it . No visible stars more distant than a few thousand light-years. No fossils. No limestone deposits. No nested hierarchy of living forms. No genetic relatedness. No common retroviral insertions. No pyramids (not enough people at the time to build them). It could all be right there, staring us in the face, scientifically verifiable. Only it isn't. Religions have made their play for the origin of humanity, and they blew it. Thank's very much; we'll call you. Maybe we'll find a god at the end of our microscopes and telescopes, but if we do it isn't going to be one anybody's been praying to.","origin-life","08:28 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","126"

No matter how small the gap and the smaller the harder to fill, God seems to be there.

"05-21-2013","22372",9,"Hdreams","473474","If i am truly honest i would probably prefer the genesis tale as well. Unfortunately though i haven't won the lottery, married Mila Kunis, won the Nobel prize in Medicine for developing a cure for Cancer & Aids at the same time or discovered the first Earth like extra-solar planet. If only wishing made it true. We have to deal with the facts, and the lack of current knowledge doesn't presuppose a gods intervention. We have never witnessed life's creation, it may well be all over the universe and extremely common. We may look back in a hundred years and wonder why we missed it, being so simple. I can appreciate the poetry, the stories and the intended lessons. I cant appreciate the outdated explanations and obviously wildly inaccurate statements which have no bearing to what we know. In reference to the spontaneity of it, the clustering of organic compounds and amino acids is well documented. the actions of life we can test. but many of the complex questions. Such as the the moment a proto-cell starts to reproduce, the construction of the cell wall matrix, the acquisition of mitochondria into the cell (itself a separate organism) are the points up for debate. If the odds of life in the universe are high then it makes more sense that life was seeded by comet or meteorite, at least in probability factors. It may well be that we are arguing about a defunct point, that life was seeded here by comet and it never spontaneously erupted in the first place. Though this would lead irrevocably to the next argument. How did life start on that planet then? Perhaps different elements, higher levels of organic compound, different environmental and atmospheric conditions, Obviously all theory. For the moment at least. That life started here 4.1 billion years ago shows it can exist, if it exists here then the odds of it existing elsewhere are monumental. I am pretty confident that within my lifetime we will be at a point where we can create life in a laboratory setting. Will we then become gods ourselves?","Winston Smith","473476","You are missing the point totally. Of course we know the Universe was not created as per the Bible. And yes, of course we know there is life in the universe, at least here on Earth. And yes, saying that life was seeded by a meteorite would mean asking and how life came about in the meteorite? It doesn't answer anything it is just speculation What is the point ? The point is: this reductionist science has been unable to fill the gap between matter and living matter. Where is the property of ""life"" ? and better don't ask where is the property of intelligence, consciousness et cetera. So my question to Peeling is show me where in matter is the property or properties that transform matter into a living organism? where is the formula? what are the ingredients? what is the recipe? what is the oven? metaphorically speaking that is. is life a property of matter or not? and if yes then show me what it is and where it resides. The 'spontaneous"" appearance of life is the equivalent of saying God created life minus God. Life just happened 'spontaneously'. if this the is best science can do then I'd rather read The Bible.","origin-life","12:55 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","129"

A better analogy, though still far from perfect, would be a huge box full of differently magnetised shapes, violently and continuously shaken in zero gravity.

Thank you, finally the answer to the above question: Science doesn't know. I have never asked about the properties of living matter. My simple question that you already admitted you don't know the answer, is how come that atoms arrange into living things.

Just explain how the pattern that produces life came about. how non-living matter made it to living-matter when you cannot find in non-living matter any property that causes this pattern. Of course I know that. It was an analogy not a literal example and you know it. Your 'analogy' is misleading and evasive. I am not asking if and how life evolved. I am asking you how can atoms whose properties we know, came to form living matter. Where is the organizing property in them? and if it is not in them where is it? And once they organized into living things they replicated again and again and also evolved. But, forget the evolution of life. I am just focusing in that little difference, that little gap between living matter and non-living matter and that little gap is still unfilled. So please fill it. You are simply saying that if you shake the box long enough the particles will become alive. But the shaking enables something that must be intrinsic in them. What I mean is you can shake a box full of nails for all eternity and nothing will come out of it. You are speculating how it happened, that's all. You know that 'shaking' it is not enough, something else, something crucial is needed, which you don't know. Be honest, admit it. I am disappointed in you because after all these years of admiring your intelligence and knowledge and honesty, now, you are disingenuous, evasive and misleading. Is it so hard to say ""I don't know""? Of course I know the difference. The burger you ate for lunch was the flesh of a living animal; which I don't eat for I am vegetarian. Your assertion that science will find all the answers is faith and hubris rolled in one. Many humble scientists disagree with you. They doubt we have the intellectual capabilities to understand everything. Of course faith by definition is impervious to doubt. So, you see, you have something in common with Archie, you are both men of faith, both believers.","origin-life","08:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","135"
