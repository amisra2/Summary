What if an advanced alien race created us? That sounds more plausible than saying some ghostly magical being called god did it.
Turn No: 2: Easyrider:
It's still the same argument, meat face. Did the aliens "evolve" or did God create them? Duh.
Turn No:3
Accipiter:
Should we just give up and invoke magic to explain it?
Turn No:4
Easyrider:
You godless evolutionists already believe in magic. So keep on believing.
Turn No:5
Accipiter:
Magic is the art of tricking people into believing things that you want them to believe which is something you constantly fail to do.

My point was that you can't have the perfect universe you think God should be manifesting unless you create pre-programmed robots who can only do good. Then there's no free will to do evil. So that's why I asked you the question: Tell us, how do you obtain a perfect universe when you create man with free will so he can be a free moral agent to sin or not sin?

It makes even more sense if you just assume that there is no god.

So you don't have a girlfriend or wife because no one can stand being around you? I think god is trying to tell you something.

Personally, I'd say spontaneous abiogenesis seems the most likely origin of life on Earth, regardless of difficulties with current hypotheses. Why? Because the evidence we have has narrowed the options down long past the point where the involvement of a deity makes sense. To put it another way: the gaps have become too small for any god worth bothering with to fit in them. Once upon a time we didn't have a good enough grasp of zoology, geology, paleontology, astronomy etc to spot what is now obvious: all macroscopic life is related and descended from a common ancestor over millions of years. So we imagined ourselves created in our present forms and created great big gods to fill the void. These days the creator is subsisting on a diet of, what, UV radiation and free oxygen? Boiled any frogs lately? I just feel like we've given the god hypothesis enough chances - the kind of gods we concocted to start with at any rate. Genesis had the earth made in under a week and a man and woman siring the human race a few thousand years ago. Were that true, there's no reason at all why we couldn't just see it . No visible stars more distant than a few thousand light-years. No fossils. No limestone deposits. No nested hierarchy of living forms. No genetic relatedness. No common retroviral insertions. No pyramids (not enough people at the time to build them). It could all be right there, staring us in the face, scientifically verifiable. Only it isn't. Religions have made their play for the origin of humanity, and they blew it. Thank's very much; we'll call you. Maybe we'll find a god at the end of our microscopes and telescopes, but if we do it isn't going to be one anybody's been praying to.

Turn No: 2: Winston Smith:
so how does reductionist science explain this spontaneous abiogenesis ? obviously science can fill this little gap without recourse to God, right ? the definition of 'sponateous' is : developing or occurring without apparent external influence, force, cause, or treatment so matter just became alive? where in matter is this property found, maybe if we keep splitting and splittng matter will find it one day ? No matter how small the gap and the smaller the harder to fill, God seems to be there. I don't know I prefer the Genesis tale, at least there is poetry in its words.
Turn No:3
Peeling:
The momentum, the trajectory of scientific discoveries suggests that it will. I'm saying we've long since eliminated the kind of gaps our gods made sense filling. Clinging to the hope they may have tweaked an amino acid here and there seems pretty desperate, when you consider what we once imagined them to have done. I merely meant 'as opposed to the deliberate instigation of an external agent'. If I chose words poorly, I apologise. It's not a qualitative change, though. No, we won't, any more than we could isolate an elemental quality of 'being a wheel' by taking one apart and looking at the bits. Living is something matter does when arranged in certain shapes - just like rolling is something it does when arranged in a circle.
Turn No:4
Winston Smith:
your faith is strong No, it is an organizational change. Of course atoms don't change when become part of a living organism. It is an organizational change and what a difference it makes. So I will ask you once again how does non living matter transforms itself into living matter, where is the let's call it "transformational property" in matter ?? Thank you, finally the answer to the above question: Science doesn't know. I have never asked about the properties of living matter. My simple question that you already admitted you don't know the answer, is how come that atoms arrange into living things. You can't no matter how much you split matter find a quality or property that enables it to become alive.
Turn No:5
Peeling:
When you can see the trajectory of a ball, you don't need much faith to put your hand where it needs to be to catch it. You can cross your fingers and hope it sprouts wings before it hits the ground if you like - that takes faith. I honestly don't know what you mean by 'organizational change' or 'transformational property'. Molecules form from atoms bonding. Some molecules self-replicate in the presence of raw materials. That's what they do , chemically, according to the laws of physics, just like hydrogen and oxygen make water. That wasn't the answer. The answer was: "That's a silly question." You can't isolate the property of 'being like a wheel' by breaking a wheel apart and looking at the bits. 'Being like a wheel' is a name for the physical behaviour that naturally emerges when matter is in a particular shape. Similarly, it makes no sense to ask whether we'll find the spark of life by taking something that is 'being alive' and breaking it apart, because there is no spark . 'Being alive' is just a label we put on an especially complex series of chemical reactions, the same way we label other chemical reactions as 'fire' or 'melting'. Do you understand? The matter in your body isn't doing anything different, in terms of the physical laws it's following, from the matter in your computer monitor. We label the 'big picture' certain behaviour generates as 'life'. Eh? We already know the properties of matter that enable it to become alive: the physical forces of nature. Atoms bonding to atoms, molecules bonding to molecules, molecules catalysing reactions with other molecules, molecules bonding in such a way as they create copies of themselves. I read an article a while ago - I'll try to track it down for you. It demonstrates how most simple rule-sets will give rise to surprisingly complex outcomes in a minority of possible starting conditions. It's a strikingly similar story with atoms and the laws of physics: you get a hell of a lot of amorphous, chaotic or inert stuff like air, water, the stars and so forth. Then there are a lot of simple repeating patterns: crystals and the like. And then there are just a few starting conditions that create complex non-repeating patterns - life.
Turn No:6
Winston Smith:
now, that is incoherent nonsense. how come they create copies of themselves ? How? Why? Again, reporting is not explaining conditions do not create. I wonder if you realised your slip : "create". I see, the questions you don't have an answer for are 'silly questions". At least Dani is honest when he says "we don't know" the answer to that 'silly question" of how non-living matter organises itself into living matter. I thought you were an intelligent person. You aren't. You have proven to me this: you are arrogant in your ignorance and you are dishonest in your arguing.
Turn No:7
Peeling:
It's really not Look: We inspect an object. We label it 'round'. We see a solid/gas boundary that is non-perpendicular to the local gravity and we label it a 'slope'. We watch what happens when physical forces act upon the 'round' object resting on the 'slope', and we label that 'rolling'. Now, can we take the 'round' object apart, look at the atoms and find some essence of 'rolling' in there? Of course not. The individual atoms are not rolling. When we say 'that ball is rolling down a slope' it's shorthand for "Atom 1 is moving in this direction, atom 2 is moving in that direction..." and so on. I've written a few physics simulations (for fun and profit) that use points connected by springs. The points have no concept of rotation, only of position and velocity. Nor do the springs - they only care about distance. Yet if I set up a circular pattern of points and connect them with springs, it'll happily roll down a slope, because 'rolling' is a behaviour that emerges from the underlying forces. I didn't need to 'program in' rolling. It's exactly the same with life. When you zoom way, way in and look at what individual molecules are doing, they're each just obeying the same laws of physics as everything else: moving, bonding and so forth. The aggregate effect of those motions, we've labelled 'life'. Ok, let's start with a quote from an article about one lab experiment: The first thing to get our heads around is what a catalyst does. When I was at school I was given the simple version: catalysts speed up reactions. The more accurate and interesting way to think about catalysts is that they make individual molecular reactions more likely , and they do so in a surprisingly straightforward and mechanical way. Remember when I talked about how the molecules in your cells are flying around smacking into each other billions of times a second? Well, in the experiment quoted above, you've got a solution containing billions of copies of four different molecules (call them A, B, C and D), and those molecules are whizzing around banging into each other. Now, if A and B happen to bang into each other in just the right way, they'll bond to form a larger molecule AB. Just chemistry; nothing unusual. The same is true for molecules C and D, making CD. But at low energies (temperatures), it's hugely unlikely these reactions will occur. Ok so far? The interesting part is that this particular molecule AB attracts passing C and D molecules. And just as two magnets will orient themselves and clamp together when they get close, AB's shape and chemical bonds pull in and spin C and D molecules such that they line up in precisely the right way to 'click together' and form CD. And as they click together, they detach from AB, leaving AB free to pull in and bond more C and D molecules. So AB 'manufactures' CD out of a mixed solution of C and D. Again, this is perfectly straightforward chemistry and physics; the sort of thing we make use of all the time in manufacturing. But CD also performs the reverse: it pulls in, orients and 'clicks together' A and B molecules. So in this case the two molecules replicate each other - not strictly 'self replication' but the end result is the same: AB/CD makes more AB/CD. Obviously to get the ball rolling you need a first molecule of AB or CD. But the formation of AB without CD's assistance isn't impossible , it might just take an unusual jolt of energy (eg an electric spark) to make it likely. And once you've got AB, you're away. In the experiment the scientists deliberately seeded the solution with some AB/CD, but that's just for experimental convenience. The upshot is, there are two things we don't know with regards to organic chemistry: 1. We don't know what the first replicating molecules actually were, in terms of their detailed chemical structure. We know amino acids are naturally occurring, we can make some educated guesses about the kind of molecules involved (eg RNA), but it's entirely possible the specific molecules (which after all had a test tube the size of the universe and hundreds of millions of years in which to jostle) may never be known. 2. We're still working on understanding why the basic laws of physics are what they are. But that's the same mystery we see when we look at the sun, or a black hole, or anything else. But there is no mystery at all as to how or why 'living' molecules behave as they do: they behave just like any other molecule: whizzing around, encountering other molecules and catalysing reactions. It just so happens that the reactions they catalyse are circular : they feed back upon themselves. In the lab example above it's a simple back-and-forth tick-tock: AB makes CD, CD makes AB, and they do so by just banging into raw materials drifting in solution. In you and I, we see the result of a two-billion-year arms race, where molecules that are more successful at gathering raw materials and closing the loop of their chemical reactions have prospered. My personal chemical reaction took 32 years to cycle - that's when my daughter was born Does that help? You're quite right; that was a slip. I should have said: "And then there are just a few starting conditions from which the laws of physics derive complex non-repeating patterns - life" Well, here's what you said: "so matter just became alive? where in matter is this property found, maybe if we keep splitting and splittng matter will find it one day ? " Suppose I asked you: "So that shape just began to roll? Where in matter is this 'rolling' property found? Maybe if we keep splitting and splitting matter we'll find it one day." You would quite rightly tell me it was a silly question. Why? Because 'rolling' is not a fundamental property of matter. It's a label for the aggregate motion of many molecules, something which by definition cannot be found by inspecting them individually. Similarly, life is not a fundamental property - of matter or anything else. It is an emergent behaviour - and if I can forestall your objection, 'emergent behaviour' isn't just another way of saying 'it appears from nowhere with no explanation." Emergent describes behaviour implicit in a set of rules rather than explicit ; something that happens when the rules are applied which one could not predict by inspection of the rules themselves. (As an aside, it is mathematically demonstrable that the outcome of many iterative processes cannot be predicted - not in the sense that their outcome is uncertain or different each time, but in that there is no equation into which you can plug a time T and yield a result - the only way to find out what happens at time T is to actually simulate the iterations of the process up to that point. It is impossible, for instance, to deduce the beautiful complexity of the Mandlebrot Set by simple inspection of the function which generates it.) In my physics simulations, rolling behaviour was implicit in the entirely linear rule-set of forces. I didn't realise this when I wrote the first one (I think I was maybe 12 at the time), and spent ages vainly trying to code in 'spinning'. It was only when I gave up, took the mess of equations out, and just gave my springy cube a linear nudge at one of it's corners that I noticed it span perfectly well all on its own. I'm disappointed you think that. I have certainly not been dishonest - if I have come across as arrogant I apologise. I hope this post has gone some way to repairing my reputation with you
