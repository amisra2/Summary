Im not trying dress you up as in bat for the church, or any theological group for that matter, but your declaring this like an evangelist. Of course science doesnt know. It would be front page news everywhere but the deep south. But we are alot closer than we were 20 years ago. sometimes problematic as every answer reveals another puzzle, but you dont go straight from A to Z, you have to go through every other letter as well. This is the scientific method. You sound like Bill O'reilly declaring a statement, ""as science doesn't know yet, ill stick with the same answer we have had for the last 2000 years. This answer doesnt explain anything really, and poses more questions than science does, but hell.... Means i dont have to think about it anymore."" Perhaps i misread your intonation, its possible.","Winston Smith","473521","Not because we have advanced this far, it means we will advance for ever and ever in knowledge. And don't put words in my mouth, don't give me the ""you sound ..."" I have never said that I accept the Biblical narrative as scientific truth. The moment you try to make me 'sound' you kill all dialogue with me. Dishonesty in argumentation I don't tolerate. I hardly post anymore for I have no time for infantile point scoring, insults, twisting the words of others, putting words in the mouths of others, ""you sound .."" et cetera. I joined this thread only because I thought that maybe Peeling would have something interesting, illuminating to say on this subject. Maybe he knew how to fill this crucial, the most important 'gap' of all without resorting to God. alas, I was wrong. Once, many years ago, I asked Peeling why being the wheel such a wonderful device which has been so useful to us, it did not happen in living organisms, and he explained to me the reasons why. I was impressed and delighted with his answer. But, that was then this is now.","origin-life","02:24 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","138"

You will just have to accept that science is much more intellectually honest than religion. If we don't know we say... 'I don't know'. ..as opposed to religion which makes up a story and sticks to it, regardless of the verifiable evidence against it. I repeat again, 'gods' are a minuscule possibility, they are not an automatic default.","origin-life","05:18 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","139"

"05-22-2013","22372",10,"Winston Smith","473509","your faith is strong No, it is an organizational change. Of course atoms don't change when become part of a living organism. It is an organizational change and what a difference it makes. So I will ask you once again how does non living matter transforms itself into living matter, where is the let's call it ""transformational property"" in matter ?? Thank you, finally the answer to the above question: Science doesn't know. My simple question that you already admitted you don't know the answer, is how come that atoms arrange into living things. You can't no matter how much you split matter find a quality or property that enables it to become alive.","Peeling","473534","When you can see the trajectory of a ball, you don't need much faith to put your hand where it needs to be to catch it. You can cross your fingers and hope it sprouts wings before it hits the ground if you like - that takes faith. I honestly don't know what you mean by 'organizational change' or 'transformational property'. Molecules form from atoms bonding. Some molecules self-replicate in the presence of raw materials. That's what they do , chemically, according to the laws of physics, just like hydrogen and oxygen make water. That wasn't the answer. The answer was: ""That's a silly question."" You can't isolate the property of 'being like a wheel' by breaking a wheel apart and looking at the bits. 'Being like a wheel' is a name for the physical behaviour that naturally emerges when matter is in a particular shape. Similarly, it makes no sense to ask whether we'll find the spark of life by taking something that is 'being alive' and breaking it apart, because there is no spark . 'Being alive' is just a label we put on an especially complex series of chemical reactions, the same way we label other chemical reactions as 'fire' or 'melting'. Do you understand? The matter in your body isn't doing anything different, in terms of the physical laws it's following, from the matter in your computer monitor. We label the 'big picture' certain behaviour generates as 'life'. Eh? We already know the properties of matter that enable it to become alive: the physical forces of nature. Atoms bonding to atoms, molecules bonding to molecules, molecules catalysing reactions with other molecules, molecules bonding in such a way as they create copies of themselves. I read an article a while ago - I'll try to track it down for you. It demonstrates how most simple rule-sets will give rise to surprisingly complex outcomes in a minority of possible starting conditions. It's a strikingly similar story with atoms and the laws of physics: you get a hell of a lot of amorphous, chaotic or inert stuff like air, water, the stars and so forth. Then there are a lot of simple repeating patterns: crystals and the like. And then there are just a few starting conditions that create complex non-repeating patterns - life.","origin-life","01:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","145"

Again, reporting is not explaining conditions do not create. I wonder if you realised your slip : ""create"". I see, the questions you don't have an answer for are 'silly questions"". At least Dani is honest when he says ""we don't know"" the answer to that 'silly question"" of how non-living matter organises itself into living matter. I thought you were an intelligent person. You aren't. You have proven to me this: you are arrogant in your ignorance and you are dishonest in your arguing.","origin-life","08:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","148"
"05-22-2013","22372",10,"Hdreams","473525","Science is simply a method employed to understand your surroundings. As long as humans walk this or any other planet i see no reason why our knowledge would not continue to expand as those individuals strive to understand the universe around them, we are naturally curious as a species and short of a dark age of technology. Perhaps through war or disaster i see no reason why it would cease. Furthermore even this would only be a temporary lull.","Winston Smith","473547","You don't see no reason? Simple, our intelligence is limited therefore it makes sense that there are things we will never be able to understand. This is the reason why many scientists accept that no matter how hard we try (and we should continue trying), there are limits to what the human race can learn. Don't you know that some people are more intelligent than others? There are problems that many people can never solve (mathematical problems for instance) whereas other can. Think about it. Or, compare us to other species, to any other species really. Now, they can learn so much and no more, they are limited. We have advanced more than them, but it doesn't mean we can understand everything if we are given enough time. To believe this is hubris, unwarranted hubris. Anyway, enough of this. It's become boring. zzzz.....zzzzz","origin-life","09:37 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","149"

You will keep asking 'how, why' until we have no more answers to your 'but why dad, why' and then you will claim 'See, you don't know and if you don't know, the only answer must be that God did it and not only that..it was the particular god that I believe in'. You will then puff out your chest, declare victory and walk away...very much like Easyrider does. He has given you answers. That you would rather believe in superstition is, IMO, your problem. So, assuming that we don't yet know, why don't you give us your explanation, accompanied of course by the verifiable, testable evidence to support your claim.","origin-life","11:37 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","150"
