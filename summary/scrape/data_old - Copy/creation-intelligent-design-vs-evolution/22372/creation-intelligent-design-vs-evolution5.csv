Free agent A God, the right path, yet free agent B chooses sin, the wrong path. Why? Was B simply given a free will that was negatively inclined?

Then you apply a test and you modify your probability according to the results of the test. This principle was first espoused by Bayes while throwing out billiard balls on his pool table to try to figure out if the line he had drawn was, indeed, in the middle. Still, I suppose it would be too much to hope that an atheist might have studied Bayesian statistics. At any rate, what happens if you don't know the a priori probability? Well, normally you guess. What if you have no basis for a guess? Well, then, you invoke the Principle of Insufficient Reason -- from Wolfram MathWorld which suggests that given n possibilities the chance of each possibility is 1/n and you proceed from there to make adjustments as your information increases. So obviously you are either saying: 1. You had some sort of personal experience that convinced you that God couldn't exist; or, 2. You are just a prejudiced mother f... er... person who just decided for no reason at all to adopt an extreme position. Which is it?","origin-life","01:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","66"

I post indicating that the Christian God is a complete impossibility and then you claim that my mathematics are somehow ""Christian mathematics."" You are one ignorant inbred reading-comprehension-challenged dipstick. A product of government schooling, I've no doubt. Additionally your claims are factually wrong. Here's why: God exists is equivalent to: Everything that doesn't exist isn't God. So when you claim that fairies, goblins, and unicorns don't exist this is really evidence in favor of the idea that God exists since fairies not existing and not being God is inductive support for the idea that everything that doesn't exist isn't God (unless you're claiming that unicorns don't exist and are also God... something I seriously doubt). If you had a brain at all you would simply say that the existence of God or gods is not a matter for scientific inquiry as the claim that God exists is not falsifiable and therefore no experimental evidence can be obtained one way or another.","origin-life","01:29 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","67"

But anyway, let's say for the moment that the chance of Yahweh existing is 50/50. Would you agree that the same can be said for Zeus? If so, we have to ask ourselves if it is possible for both Zues and Yahweh to exist, or are they mutually exclusive. If they could both exist then we are still stuck at 50/50 for both of them, but if they are mutually exclusive, then we have 3 possibilities, Yahweh, Zeus, or neither. Now we have knocked the probability down to 1/3, with no further examination. Next we can consider Zoroaster. If this god has a 50/50 chance of existence, we should then ask if his existence would preclude one or both of the other two. So what probability would he have? After we have considered the same for all the Norse, Roman, Greek, Celtic, Japanese, Chinese, Hawaiian, Polynesian, Slavic, Native American, Native Australian gods (my apologies for any gods excluded or duplicated), what would the probability for each be? And even if we manage to work out the probability what would that tell us about the veracity of each one? And would it be reasonable to believe in all, some or one of them with zero actual evidence to back up our belief?","origin-life","01:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","69"
"03-08-2013","22372",5,"TeaAddict","471171","I am trying to establish a baseline, know exactly what you believe and why you believe it, before I responded. This is where the mistake lies: you assume that because other planets have similar attributes to this one, and this one has life, then those planets may have life. Life is not simply an environmental variable. It is complex. To assume that life can form once out of random reactions is incredible. To assume that it could have happened more than once is folly. No, you dont HAVE to, but you just said that you would continue to search for the answer, so you at the very least WANT to. My point is, the answer is right there.","smiley","471175","Fair enough. You are wrong. I have made no assumptions here. I have examined the evidence. Evidence which I laid out in my previous post. However, you have made the assumption that life is more than an environmental variable. Do you have actual evidence for this? You also assume that life cannot form out of random reactions. Do you have actual evidence for this? And to continue, if life did form out of random reactions once, for it to happen again elsewhere would certainly not be incredible, nor folly. Indeed, given similar conditions, why would you feel it reasonable to claim that it could not have happened elsewhere? Which answer is 'right there'? Is this the same answer for which you have offered zero evidence?","origin-life","06:55 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","72"
"03-08-2013","22372",5,"smiley","471164","My apologies, I had not read the post claiming that the Christian god was a complete impossibility, though I would like to see your figures on this. However, I did see the following, which clearly states that the probability is 50/50. Am I incorrect? I suppose it was wrong of me to presume you were talking about the christian god in this case. However, it is also true that the 50/50 argument for god's existence is one that is frequently brought up by christians, and it is bunkum. Also your claim that fairies etc not existing is somehow evidence of god's existence is also a big pile of poo poo. Your jump to this conclusion is highly suspect. Oh, and many thanks for the insults by the way. But to conclude, you claim that I should simply state that god's/gods' existence is not a matter for scientific inquiry. I find myself disagreeing again - perhaps my lack of brain, who knows! Many claim that god influences life here on earth, through influencing elections, sending storms or earthquakes, answering prayers, or other direct action. These are concrete measurable claims. So these can be examined through scientific means. No?","Easyrider","471180","You're not going to find God in a test tube, doofus.
