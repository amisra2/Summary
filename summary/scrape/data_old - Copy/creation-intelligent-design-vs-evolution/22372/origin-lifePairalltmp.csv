"","03-04-2013","22372","TeaAddict","470975","No, my point is that atheists claim that the existence of God is not plausible, but then they state that aliens from distant planets make more sense. But think about it: Say aliens from the Andromeda galaxy came to our galaxy and dropped off some living cells which evolved into what we see today. Were did these aliens come from? Did aliens create those aliens? if so, where did THEY come from?? And the fact is that it is impossible for life to form randomly. The chances are zero. The planet has to be not-too-close, and not-too-far from it's sun, an atmosphere must be present on the planet, the atmosphere much be able to support organic life, organic compounds must be present, the compounds must come together in the right way to form some kind of life, this life must be able to survive and reproduce, the life must evolve, the life must not be destroyed by some natural disaster, etc etc etc... Then once a civilization forms, it must not destroy itself with its newly discovered technology, it must survive long enough to develop the technology to travel to other worlds, (and find a world with the parameters above).... In a nutshell, its impossible. But a being who is outside of time, (and therefore wouldn't have and wouldn't need an origin), would be inorganic so would not be susceptible to biological dangers, would be omnipotent, so it wouldn't need technology, and would be infinitely intelligent. Be honest with yourself, don't you think this makes more sense? My point was that there is no physical evidence for either side, but an omnipotent God is the more plausible conclusion.","smiley","470976","Argument from ignorance - I can't see how it could have happened so god must have done it. followed by . . . Special pleading - Everything must have an origin. Oh, apart from my god.","origin-life","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","28","04:15 PM"
"","03-04-2013","22372","TeaAddict","470979","So you are willing to ignore sound explanations just because you don't like them? Wishful thinking - I don't want to believe that God exists, so I'm gonna believe that aliens created us, even though it makes less sense. Everything in a physical universe that is bound by time must have an origin. Something that is not bound by time doesn't have to have and origin. God is outside of time, therefore he doesn't have to have an origin. Do you see any problems with these assessments?","smiley","470984","You did not give a sound explanation. Your assertion that life forming randomly is impossible is rubbish. It may be extremely improbable, but that does not mean impossible. Just because you can't cope with big numbers does not mean that we have to insert the biggest non-answer (god) into the equation. We know for certain that there is life on this planet. We also know that there are other planets throughout this galaxy (not to mention the billions of other galaxies) that have similar orbits around similar stars to our own. So it is no big stretch to at least think it possible that there is life somewhere else in the universe. I do not believe that life on this planet was seeded by some alien who stopped off here to perform some science experiment, but it is a possibility. It is also possible that we are the result of some alien poop that traveled here on a rogue asteroid, but there is also no evidence for that. So, we have evidence that life can exist on planets that are like our own, but we have zero evidence that there is some superior being that exists outside of time and space. No-one has ever been outside of time and space to witness this beast. Who says that everything in the physical universe has to have an origin? Why do we have to invent something outside of 'time and space' just because we don't completely understand 'time and space'? It is certainly possible that such a being exists, but until we have actual evidence of such a being, believing in it is just plain stupid.","origin-life","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","30","11:12 PM"
"","03-05-2013","22372","TeaAddict","471009","What?? You have NO evidence , you have theories . You argument is the equivalent of looking up at a mountain from the ground, and saying Well, there is air up there, and I see plants, it looks habitable, so there are people up there ! And they must be my ancestors !! Can you give me an example of something that DOESNT have to have an origin in time? I know about logical fallacies. And I understand what smiley is saying, but Im pointing out the fallacies in HIS argument. Wishful Thinking is a type of red herring fallacy, and it applies to the entire atheist argument. He is also drawing conclusions from theories without evidence, and stating that a belief in God is absurd, even though he has no evidence for his claim or against a belief in God.","smiley","471015","You're correct, I just have theories. When there is a lack of evidence, that is the correct position to take. And your analogy is complete rubbish. Nowhere did I say THERE ARE or THERE MUST BE. All I said was IT IS POSSIBLE. Who can say? Have you ever seen matter created? Perhaps matter has always existed, and doesn't need an origin in time. Please point out any conclusions that I drew without evidence. A quote would be nice. And I find it laughable that you feel that wishful thinking is an atheist position.","origin-life","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","42","12:45 PM"
"","03-06-2013","22372","TeaAddict","471080","Yet you find it stupid to believe in God because we dont have evidence? Thats exactly what it is. I dont want to believe in God, I dont want to follow any rules, so and theories about little green men and hypothetical molecules follow. Yes, there are some people today that are atheists simply because they were raised that way. But quite often, these people will see the error in atheism and convert to Christianity.","smiley","471083","Again, please point out where I have made a claim to believe in something without evidence. I have merely stipulated that given what we do know, other things MAY BE POSSIBLE. There is no statement of belief there. You claim that people are atheist because of what they 'want' to believe? Belief is not something you choose. There is no evidence for your god, so I do not believe it. I could pretend to believe it, but I could not choose to believe it. And are you now claiming that atheists are less inclined to follow rules than theists? The evidence is vastly against you on that point too. As for what, according to you, follows an atheist viewpoint, they have nothing to do with atheism. Atheism is a one belief shop. There is not enough evidence for a belief in a god. Any other belief has nothing to do with it.","origin-life","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","48","06:05 PM"
"","03-06-2013","22372","TeaAddict","471084","Do you accept that aliens may be, purposefully or accidentally, our creators? Why do you accept/reject this possibility? Do you accept that God may be our creator? Why do you accept/reject this possibility? There is no physical evidence for or against either of these theories, so why do you accept one and reject the other/accept them both? By rules, I meant the laws laid down in the Bible. Atheism is the rejection of the belief in God or Gods. So if you dont believe in God, you have to come up with something to believe, something to explain your origins. Something to answer that age-old question Why am I here?, a question easily answered from the Christian viewpoint. Atheist viewpoint? Not so easy.","smiley","471089","I note that you have still failed to point out any claims of belief without evidence that I have made. I will assume that you cannot, and are just intellectually dishonest. It would have been so easy just to admit it. Anyway, back to your little game. I do accept that it is possible that aliens may be, purposefully or accidentally, our creators. I have already explained why, but I will repeat myself for your benefit. We know that there is life on this planet (in as far as we can know anything). This can be regarded as evidence. This planet has an unusual set of conditions, size, orbit, type of star etc, that happens to be fairly good at supporting life (at least life as we know it). This can be regarded as evidence. We also know that there are many other planets in this galaxy that have similar size, orbit, star etc, so there is a reasonable possibility that they may also be inhabited. The existence of these planets may also be regarded as evidence. So I believe that it is possible that there is life on these planets. However, it would be silly to say that I believe that there is life on these planets, until actual evidence of this life is observed. It is conceivable that the life on one of these other planets seeded the life on our own. However, it would be wrong to believe it to be true until actual evidence for it is observed. I also do accept that god may be our creator. There is no evidence of this, but it is 'possible'. So, you are wrong when you claim that there is no physical evidence for or against either of the theories. So, it would also be fair to say of you that you do not want to believe in Allah, because you don't want to follow any rules. And by rules I mean those laid down in the Quran. I would also hazard a guess that there are plenty of rules laid down in the bible to which you choose not to adhere. So, we are probably fairly even on that score. Why do I have to come up with something to believe when it comes to my origins? Is it not enough to say that I do not yet know, but will continue to search for an answer? Theist viewpoint? I don't know everything, but I feel I must have an answer, so I will believe in something that I cannot possibly truly comprehend. Anything I don't know can be laid at his door, and I will need look know further as I can claim that I already know the truth. Simple, but stupid. Atheist viewpoint? I do not know everything, but I am quite prepared to admit that I don't know some things rather than inventing a non-answer to assuage my fear of the unknown. However, I will continue to investigate that which I don't yet know. So far there is no evidence for a god, so I do not believe in it. If I find evidence for god then would be the time to start believing, with further investigation, of course. Very easy and just plain sensible.","origin-life","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","52","09:33 PM"
"","03-08-2013","22372","TeaAddict","471171","I am trying to establish a baseline, know exactly what you believe and why you believe it, before I responded. This is where the mistake lies: you assume that because other planets have similar attributes to this one, and this one has life, then those planets may have life. Life is not simply an environmental variable. It is complex. To assume that life can form once out of random reactions is incredible. To assume that it could have happened more than once is folly. No, you dont HAVE to, but you just said that you would continue to search for the answer, so you at the very least WANT to. My point is, the answer is right there.","smiley","471175","Fair enough. You are wrong. I have made no assumptions here. I have examined the evidence. Evidence which I laid out in my previous post. However, you have made the assumption that life is more than an environmental variable. Do you have actual evidence for this? You also assume that life cannot form out of random reactions. Do you have actual evidence for this? And to continue, if life did form out of random reactions once, for it to happen again elsewhere would certainly not be incredible, nor folly. Indeed, given similar conditions, why would you feel it reasonable to claim that it could not have happened elsewhere? Which answer is 'right there'? Is this the same answer for which you have offered zero evidence?","origin-life","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","72","06:55 PM"

If anything, its been proven to be useFUL.","smiley","471315","Indeed, I guess placebos have been shown to be useful. It shows the power of the mind - nothing to do with a magic sky daddy.","origin-life","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","109","11:59 AM"
"","03-12-2013","22372","TeaAddict","471318","No, I don't just mean praying and then getting pleasure out of it, I mean asking God for help and getting it. Asking God to guide you and getting guidance. And you didn't answer the question. When, where, and how was prayer shown to be useless?","smiley","471321","If you take a look at all the scientific studies that have been done into the power of prayer, you will find that some claim to have revealed a positive effect of prayer, some negative and some show no effect. Go to a football match. Both sides will pray for victory. Half the prayers are 'answered', half are not. If you want to show evidence that prayer to your deity actually works (in that your deity responds in a measurable way), you first have to prove that your deity exists, then show a positive correlation between the prayer and the result. Good luck with that. But I seriously suggest you take a look into the studies of the effect of placebos. They are really interesting.","origin-life","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","112","02:24 PM"
