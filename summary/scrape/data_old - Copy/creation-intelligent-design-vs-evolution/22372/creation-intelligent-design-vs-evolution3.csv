No-one has ever been outside of time and space to witness this beast.","Easyrider","470985","<flush> There is evidence, but it's lost on Biblically-challenged preppies like you. And for the record, Jesus has been outside of time and space, and is God. We have multiple, independent, historical affirmations of his life, death, and resurrection. Jesus is Lord!","origin-life","11:29 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","31"

"03-05-2013","22372",3,"TeaAddict","470979","So you are willing to ignore sound explanations just because you don't like them? Wishful thinking - I don't want to believe that God exists, so I'm gonna believe that aliens created us, even though it makes less sense. Everything in a physical universe that is bound by time must have an origin. Something that is not bound by time doesn't have to have and origin. God is outside of time, therefore he doesn't have to have an origin. Do you see any problems with these assessments?","Accipiter","470998","Smiley is pointing out the logical fallacies in your argument. You can begin learning about logical fallacies here. What is a logical fallacy?","origin-life","07:48 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","35"

"03-05-2013","22372",3,"TeaAddict","471009","I know about logical fallacies.","Accipiter","471011","Everybody says that.","origin-life","11:57 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","40"
"03-05-2013","22372",3,"TeaAddict","471009","What?? You have NO evidence , you have theories . You argument is the equivalent of looking up at a mountain from the ground, and saying Well, there is air up there, and I see plants, it looks habitable, so there are people up there! And they must be my ancestors!! Can you give me an example of something that DOESNT have to have an origin in time? I know about logical fallacies. And I understand what smiley is saying, but Im pointing out the fallacies in HIS argument. Wishful Thinking is a type of red herring fallacy, and it applies to the entire atheist argument. He is also drawing conclusions from theories without evidence, and stating that a belief in God is absurd, even though he has no evidence for his claim or against a belief in God.","Accipiter","471014","Why do you feel that you must defend your god so rigorously? Is it to fragile to be left unguarded?","origin-life","12:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","41"

When there is a lack of evidence, that is the correct position to take. And your analogy is complete rubbish. Nowhere did I say THERE ARE or THERE MUST BE. All I said was IT IS POSSIBLE. Who can say? Have you ever seen matter created? Perhaps matter has always existed, and doesn't need an origin in time. Please point out any conclusions that I drew without evidence. A quote would be nice. And I find it laughable that you feel that wishful thinking is an atheist position.","origin-life","12:45 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","42"
