"03-11-2013","22372",7,"smiley","471163","Are you saying that not accepting an assertion with no evidence is an extreme position? But anyway, let's say for the moment that the chance of Yahweh existing is 50/50. Would you agree that the same can be said for Zeus? If so, we have to ask ourselves if it is possible for both Zues and Yahweh to exist, or are they mutually exclusive. If they could both exist then we are still stuck at 50/50 for both of them, but if they are mutually exclusive, then we have 3 possibilities, Yahweh, Zeus, or neither. Now we have knocked the probability down to 1/3, with no further examination. Next we can consider Zoroaster. If this god has a 50/50 chance of existence, we should then ask if his existence would preclude one or both of the other two. So what probability would he have? After we have considered the same for all the Norse, Roman, Greek, Celtic, Japanese, Chinese, Hawaiian, Polynesian, Slavic, Native American, Native Australian gods (my apologies for any gods excluded or duplicated), what would the probability for each be? And even if we manage to work out the probability what would that tell us about the veracity of each one? And would it be reasonable to believe in all, some or one of them with zero actual evidence to back up our belief?","Zosimus","471258","Yes, now you're getting it! That's what being agnostic is all about. I can't say that Abraham's God doesn't exist, or Zeus, or Thor, or Vishnu. Since I don't know I comfortably and confidently say so. But you try to reason that Zeus and Yahweh are mutually exclusive so they can't both exist. This is not true. It is entirely possible (pretty likely even) that God could exist and be unknown and imcomprehensible by even his most devout followers. Really how many Christians on debate boards like this do you think actually sat down and even had a chat with Jesus for 15 minutes about anything - even the weather. Since they haven't, how could they possibly know what he thought about anything? Even Paul, the guy who ran around convincing everyone to be Christian and whose letters make up the greater part of the Bible only saw Jesus once and the only thing Jesus said to him was, ""Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks."" What logic are you using out of that to reason that Yahweh is inconsistent with Zeus? Pricks referring to the other gods, I suppose, and it being difficult implying that rejection was mandated or something? I guess if you torture a saying long enough it will reveal whatever you want it to say. Personally, though, I'm not convinced. Now maybe if I was walking along and saw a burning bush that was not being consumed I might change my mind, after I cleaned the XXXX out of my shorts and took my shoes off. Hell I might even take a stick into Egypt as long as he let me take one of my relatives as a mouthpiece but not before. No thank you - I'm not into false dichotomies. Plus if you want to use this tortured logic to try to justify anything why not apply it to your own situation? Since evolution is just one theory out of hundreds of possible creators of the world (Yahweh, Brahma, Woden, etc.) then if we assume that there are 999 identifiable religions then the chance of evolution having occurred is 1/1000 so pretty stinking unlikely. So it's funny that you use your logic on others, but squawk when it gets applied back to you.","origin-life","11:51 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","91"
"03-11-2013","22372",7,"smiley","471164","My apologies, I had not read the post claiming that the Christian god was a complete impossibility, though I would like to see your figures on this. However, I did see the following, which clearly states that the probability is 50/50. Am I incorrect? I suppose it was wrong of me to presume you were talking about the christian god in this case. However, it is also true that the 50/50 argument for god's existence is one that is frequently brought up by christians, and it is bunkum. Also your claim that fairies etc not existing is somehow evidence of god's existence is also a big pile of poo poo. Your jump to this conclusion is highly suspect. Oh, and many thanks for the insults by the way. But to conclude, you claim that I should simply state that god's/gods' existence is not a matter for scientific inquiry. I find myself disagreeing again - perhaps my lack of brain, who knows! Many claim that god influences life here on earth, through influencing elections, sending storms or earthquakes, answering prayers, or other direct action. These are concrete measurable claims. So these can be examined through scientific means. No?","Zosimus","471259","No, they cannot. In order for something to be open to scientific inquiry you must be able to find some sort of a finding that would falsify the theory in question. I would like to know what finding one could possibly make that would falsify the claim that life might have been intelligently designed and that Yahweh aka Jesus was the intelligent designer. You might say, ""Well, the eye has 6 muscles and only 3 are needed so that proves the eye wasn't designed."" Really, however, this proves nothing at all. You might as well say that a Ferrari wasn't designed since it has 12 cylinders and a car can run just fine on 3 or 4 of them. Does this prove the car wasn't designed? No, it doesn't prove anything at all. Now it's time for a remedial philosophy class. Let's get an introduction to Hempel's (Raven) paradox. From Logical Paradoxes Hempels Ravens If two statements are logically equivalent, if they assert exactly the same thing, then any evidence for one is evidence for the other. This principle appears to be truism. Consider the two statements Terry and Judith are my parents and I am Terry and Judiths child. These statements are logically equivalent, they say the same thing. There is no evidence that would support one of them without supporting the other. The Hempels Ravens paradox uses the principle to prove the absurd conclusion that an observation of a green parrot is evidence that ravens are black. The only way of avoiding this clearly unacceptable conclusion is to reject the principle above. The paradox goes like this: Consider the two statements: (1) All ravens are black. (2) Everything that isnt black, isnt a raven. These two statements say exactly the same thing. The first statement says that everything of a particular kind has a certain property. The second statement says that everything that lacks that property isnt of that kind. The two statements are therefore logically equivalent; they are true and false in exactly the same circumstances. If there is anything that is a raven but isnt black then both (1) and (2) are false; oherwise, they are both true. As the two statements are logically equivalent, any observation that supports one will also support the other. Suppose, then, that I observe a green parrot. This observation confirms (2), Everything that isnt black isnt a raven. A green parrot isnt black and isnt a raven. The observation is evidence that (2) is true. Given what has been said so far, my observation of a green parrot must also confirm (1). (1) and (2) are logically equivalent, so any evidence for one is evidence for the other. My observation of a green parrot, then, is evidence for the statement, All ravens are black. In fact, any observation of something that isnt black and isnt a raven is evidence that ravens are black. --------------------- In conclusion: As long as you think that finding black ravens makes it more likely that all ravens are black you must also accept that finding green parrots similarly increases the probability.","origin-life","12:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","92"
"03-11-2013","22372",7,"TeaAddict","471171","It is possible that the tree of life HAD to be in the Garden of Eden. Who knows, without it, it might not have even been Eden. This is a remarkably silly argument. Jesus CHOSE to die for our sins, because he loved us. Jesus wasnt forced into it, he references several times in the Gospels that he was doing it for us because he didnt want us to be punished. He would rather take the punishment. And note: God does not force this salvation on us. We can choose to accept his gift, or not to. If we choose not to accept Jesuss taking our punishment, we must take our punishment ourselves. Again, another silly argument. What makes you think God is choosing who is saved and who isnt? The choice is OURS, and ours entirely. Why would you expect God to force salvation on us if we didnt want it? Apparently, you dont know a thing about God or what the Bible says about him. You should research a subject a little more before you try debate about it. Jesus, who is one-third of God, came down to earth, became flesh, and remained that way. The whole of God is not flesh and bone, but Jesus is.","Zosimus","471260","So basically you are saying that an all-powerful God was incapable of creating Eden without putting a specific bad tree into it? That sounds suspiciously like you're saying God isn't omnipotent. So since Jesus died for your sins, what's to stop me from doing the same for my kids? Screw belief in Jesus, kids, I'm gonna get nailed to a tree on your behalf and I'll let you into heaven whether you have faith in me or not! So now you say that Jesus is one-third God. Does that mean he's only 33% infallible? Or do you mean to say that Jesus is one God of three? Or do you want to say that Jesus is entirely God but in some paradoxical way is also entirely man? That's ridiculous. It's as absurd as thinking that light is a particle and a wave at the same time.","origin-life","12:06 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","93"
"03-11-2013","22372",7,"Dani","471199","Clearly not as poor as yours. Of course they could but it wouldn't make it true unless they could provide verifiable evidence to support their claim. I could just as easily say ""We exist, but we were not created. We have always existed but before we were humans, we existed as invisible pink fairies."" Do you think my claim should stand as true? No I didn't. I said that I THINK it highly unlikely. That is my belief. I trust you understand the difference between giving one's beliefs and making a statement? The 'Negative Evidence Principle' Do you think that the likelihood of mermaids, pixies, leprechauns, Zeus, Apollo, Mithra and a thousand other gods that people do or have believed in is also 50%? That's right. If I don't know I say 'I don't know but I believe it to be true based on the available evidence'. I find it far more intellectually honest that making up stories, claiming the stories are true and threatening anyone that does not accept that my stories are true. I deride my opponents for putting forward belief as truth without being able to show that it is true.","Zosimus","471262","The negative evidence principle argues that not having evidence for a claim is a reason to believe that the claim is false. You have put forward no evidence in support of the negative evidence principle therefore in accordance with the same principle, I conclude that it is false and, indeed, self-refuting. Yes, I do think that the likelihood of mermaids, pixies, leprechauns, Zeus, Apollo, Mithria, and a thousand other gods is also 50 percent. So then, when people ask me, I say ""I don't know."" I think that's a much better solution than pretending that I know when I don't. You say that you think it's unlikely. So basically you're saying that your belief is arational? What makes you even think that there is a way to show that a proposition is true? If theory T predicts evidence E why do you think that finding evidence E confirms the theory? Isn't this the logical fallacy known as ""affirming the consequent""?","origin-life","12:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","94"

I did not reason that Yahweh and Zeus were mutually exclusive. Try reading it again. I will highlight the relevant part to assist you. Please note that I considered all possibilities, I did not push any one. If this logic is beyond you, please just admit it.

I asked that if god could have an actual physical influence on the world then these affects must be measurable, and open to scientific inquiry. You said no. Then went on with your usual rambling. A few random statements that even you admit prove nothing. Then an attempt to make it seem like I am the one who needs help with simple logic. So, you believe that if god does have a physical affect on our lives (not that I believe this) then we would still be unable to measure it.
