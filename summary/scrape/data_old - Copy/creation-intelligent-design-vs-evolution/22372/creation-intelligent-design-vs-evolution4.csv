"03-06-2013","22372",4,"TeaAddict","471080","Yet you find it stupid to believe in God because we dont have evidence? Thats exactly what it is. I dont want to believe in God, I dont want to follow any rules, so and theories about little green men and hypothetical molecules follow. Yes, there are some people today that are atheists simply because they were raised that way. But quite often, these people will see the error in atheism and convert to Christianity.","smiley","471083","Again, please point out where I have made a claim to believe in something without evidence. I have merely stipulated that given what we do know, other things MAY BE POSSIBLE. There is no statement of belief there. You claim that people are atheist because of what they 'want' to believe? Belief is not something you choose. There is no evidence for your god, so I do not believe it. I could pretend to believe it, but I could not choose to believe it. And are you now claiming that atheists are less inclined to follow rules than theists? The evidence is vastly against you on that point too. As for what, according to you, follows an atheist viewpoint, they have nothing to do with atheism. Atheism is a one belief shop. There is not enough evidence for a belief in a god. Any other belief has nothing to do with it.","origin-life","06:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","48"

"03-06-2013","22372",4,"TeaAddict","471084","Do you accept that aliens may be, purposefully or accidentally, our creators? Why do you accept/reject this possibility? Do you accept that God may be our creator? Why do you accept/reject this possibility? There is no physical evidence for or against either of these theories, so why do you accept one and reject the other/accept them both? By rules, I meant the laws laid down in the Bible. Atheism is the rejection of the belief in God or Gods. So if you dont believe in God, you have to come up with something to believe, something to explain your origins. Something to answer that age-old question Why am I here?, a question easily answered from the Christian viewpoint. Atheist viewpoint? Not so easy.","smiley","471089","I note that you have still failed to point out any claims of belief without evidence that I have made. I will assume that you cannot, and are just intellectually dishonest. It would have been so easy just to admit it. Anyway, back to your little game. I do accept that it is possible that aliens may be, purposefully or accidentally, our creators. I have already explained why, but I will repeat myself for your benefit. We know that there is life on this planet (in as far as we can know anything). This can be regarded as evidence. This planet has an unusual set of conditions, size, orbit, type of star etc, that happens to be fairly good at supporting life (at least life as we know it). This can be regarded as evidence. We also know that there are many other planets in this galaxy that have similar size, orbit, star etc, so there is a reasonable possibility that they may also be inhabited. The existence of these planets may also be regarded as evidence. So I believe that it is possible that there is life on these planets. However, it would be silly to say that I believe that there is life on these planets, until actual evidence of this life is observed. It is conceivable that the life on one of these other planets seeded the life on our own. However, it would be wrong to believe it to be true until actual evidence for it is observed. I also do accept that god may be our creator. There is no evidence of this, but it is 'possible'. So, you are wrong when you claim that there is no physical evidence for or against either of the theories. So, it would also be fair to say of you that you do not want to believe in Allah, because you don't want to follow any rules. And by rules I mean those laid down in the Quran. I would also hazard a guess that there are plenty of rules laid down in the bible to which you choose not to adhere. So, we are probably fairly even on that score. Why do I have to come up with something to believe when it comes to my origins? Is it not enough to say that I do not yet know, but will continue to search for an answer? Theist viewpoint? I don't know everything, but I feel I must have an answer, so I will believe in something that I cannot possibly truly comprehend. Anything I don't know can be laid at his door, and I will need look know further as I can claim that I already know the truth. Simple, but stupid. Atheist viewpoint? I do not know everything, but I am quite prepared to admit that I don't know some things rather than inventing a non-answer to assuage my fear of the unknown. However, I will continue to investigate that which I don't yet know. So far there is no evidence for a god, so I do not believe in it. If I find evidence for god then would be the time to start believing, with further investigation, of course. Very easy and just plain sensible.","origin-life","09:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","52"

Many atheists acknowledge the extremely slim possibility that there might be a god as it is possible, but we are atheists because while acknowledging it is impossible to know for sure, we really don't think there is a god in all likelihood. I don't see any good reason to suspect that there might be one. Similarly, I cannot definitely say fairies don't exist. There is no way to prove fairies don't exist, so there is a possibility fairies might exist. I just really don't think there are any fairies in all likelihood. I don't see any good reason to suspect that there might be any. So by that logic, can we assume that you accept that there is a possibility that Annapurna, Zeus, Balrama, Bhuvaneshwari, Brahma, Dionysus, Shiva, Krishna, Isis Dhanwantari, Mephistopheles, Mithra and thousands of other gods to numerous to mention that people believe/have believed in.... all exist...because there is no physical evidence that they do not? There is no physical evidence for or against fairies, goblins, leprechauns, unicorns, Cyclops or mermaids either so why do you reject them...assuming of course that you do. There is also no verifiable/physical evidence for Jesus The Christ either so perhaps you could tell us why you believe in something that there is no verifiable evidence for? So you conform with all 613 Mitzvot laws do you? No. We just say 'I have no idea'...which is far more intellectually honest that making up stories. Many things are easy to answer if you just make up the answers. Unfortunately, making up the answers doesn't make the answers true. Perhaps you could explain why you feel that there has to be a ""why"" for us existing anyway. It's very easy actually. In fact, it's much easier than the Christian viewpoint. We just say 'I don't know' and in that way, we do not have to spend our lives twisting, turning and squirming to justify what we believe when it is shown that what we believe just can't be true. You need to realise that.... I cannot account for it is not the same as therefore something I just make up can. ...and before you start rambling off on the 'first cause' argument let me tell you that it will be pointless since, like all Christians, you will exempt your god from needing a first cause purely because your needs dictate such. You will refuse to explain what created your god. You will want to subject your opponents to rules you refuse to abide by yourself.","origin-life","12:57 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","54"

First of all anyone could simply say, ""We exist, therefore we were created."" Second, you claim that it is highly unlikely that God exists. I would like to know how you have calculated the possibility of God's (any version) existence. Since no evidence can be mustered either way it seems to me that the chance of God existing is stuck firmly at 50 percent. Finally, I assume you believe in a Big Bang (despite the theory having been refuted). Yet you do not know what caused the big bang or the singularity that it supposedly came from. Yet you deride your opponents for saying that God exists and not knowing where he (it) came from.","origin-life","05:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","55"

First you postulate that a being existed and created everything that we see round us ex nihilo and then that things didn't work out the way he had planned because he had created some of his angels badly enough that they rebelled against him becoming Satan and his devils. Then he created man, placed him in the garden, and put a tree there for him to eat knowing full well that he would eat of it. Obviously had God simply wanted Adam to stay in the garden and not eat the tree, he could have never created the tree, created it on another planet, or half-way round the world. So God obviously planned for the tree to be eaten of, and so then the Fall came into being, he having pre-prepared a way to save man from the sin of his fathers namely that God himself would be born and live a mortal life and be crucified on a cross in order to pay for the sins of another. This is clearly contrary to anything because if someone does wrong the only justice is that the person who has done wrong is punished. Punishing someone else never alleviates the wrongdoing of another. And then God chooses to save only some people, and not others, when he created the spirit that dwells within us in the form that it is so clearly if someone sins and fails to repent the fault is with God for not having created a more contrite spirit. Then you go on insisting that God is a spirit when the Bible clearly indicates that God was born into a physical body, died, and regained that physical body complete with flesh and bones (Luke 24:39). Then you come into this forum saying that abiogenesis is wrong and the conclusion is, according to you, that we should believe that Jesus is LORD instead of, for example, believing that Vishnu, through Brahma, created the universe.
