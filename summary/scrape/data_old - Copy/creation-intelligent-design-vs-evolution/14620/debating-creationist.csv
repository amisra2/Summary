No adolescent, he's guilty of violating virtually every forum rule on the list, and is by consensus considered the forum's resident Wacko Fundie Klass Klown. Yet in his mind , he thinks he's scoring major points with some imagined audience of fans (regardless of the fact that he himself has been ""BUSTED!""--decisively, empirically, indisputably-- countless times) and masochistically comes back, day after day, sometimes well into the early hours of the morning, for still further ridicule. (Hey, would I return to a forum where, after years of posting, was cybernetically abused every time I posted? Would you? ) This is your classic ""martyr"": arguing with him simply proves his ""point""--which is that everyone but him is on a greasy slide to hell, don't you quote the Bible at ME as evidence, damn you all, Jesus would WANT me to call you scum, blah blah blah... This is the type who figures he can be as obnoxious, insulting, irrational, and un-Christ-like (in the generally accepted sense) as he pleases, because HE knows--KNOWS--that God has his back. (And if you doubt it, YOU'RE DAMNED TO HELL, CHRIST-DENIER!...) He's not trying to convert or persuade anybody but himself: that, crappy as his reality must be, everyone else is wrong and will burn for it, and he and he alone is promised a happy afterlife for fighting the good fight and staying true to the self-contradictory, sometimes savage commands of his bearded sky-pixie. He's even less worthy of debate than freedom or fart, but since he's more outrageously amusing (his detractors' posts are, anyway), people can't resist egging him on to new heights of ad hominem thunderation.

Point taken, that was actually a terrible example. What I meant to ask was 'if you knew ohm's law but couldn't remember it was called that....' The point I was trying to make was conceptual grasp as opposed to specific nomenclature or case knowledge is a more accurate proxy of knowledge. In my work I certainly look up many formula and answers on a routine basis, They wouldn't do my any good without the conceptual glue to frame them into a coherent venture so I see that conceptual glue as superior. To support this I also have the fact that few people remember everything they learned in school or even college, yet they still keep teaching it because once you learn the conceptual identities any particular element of reality the damage is done (damage meaning the ability to understand and put to productive venture in this case).","debating-creationist","11:47 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","75"
