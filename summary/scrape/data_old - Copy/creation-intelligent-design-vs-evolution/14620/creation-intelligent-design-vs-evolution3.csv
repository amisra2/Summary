I HAVE HOPE FOR YOU!!!!!","fartingle","413171","I have not once been shown to be wrong.

Of course they don't believe, they don't believe in the Bible. Biblical evidence will never amount to anything in their eyes. You need another approach. Live in peace with everyone, that's all I'm saying. Gwen","fartingle","413173","Iron sharpening iron refers to any way to make one stronger. Literally iron sharpens iron through grinding and clashing . Trust me when I make a Bible reference. I am 17 and am more of a Bible scholar than probably 95% of all Christains, 60% of pastors, 99.999% of those who ""claim Christ"", and 100% of the atheists. Of course it is near impossible to change a person's view over an internet forum , but no to try is to say, ""Oh, you're going to Hell? Here, let me pack you a lunch.""","debating-creationist","01:41 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","32"

But most articles posted on the internet are claims (nothing more) that are stated as fact. I believe that even you could look closely enough to see the holes. Edit: the ones that make REAL sense are usually not the ones saying ""...and therefore evolution."" To be fair, he was a Catholic. And Roman Catholicism holds as much water as a cup without a bottom. It does not even stand against Biblical scrutiny. Perhaps when you are looking for a material explanation you can find one here, but I meant to argue Christianity (because I truly believe the theology in addition to creationism) the phrase ""nobody cares how much you know until they know how much you care"" comes into play. Believe it or not, caring for the well-being of a person's soul is not easy to get across the internet.","debating-creationist","02:08 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","35"

Thus you rarely if ever find them proclaiming Creationism. That gets left to the evangelical nutjobs. As for a 17 year old ""knowing it all"", is there a more adolescent statement? As regards Wikipedia and similar sources, the article should list its references, I'd track back through that to a less controversial source. It's usually the Political stuff on there that tends to be dodgy. When sharpening iron I prefer a whetstone.","debating-creationist","05:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","40"

I agree that this is a debate site which means that you shouldn't contradict someone if you aren't prepared to argue about it but it also means that not every post is valid, in fact only the ones devised for honest debate are proper. So these flyby double liners that seem to be the majority of posts that people like EZ rider, trebor, and accipter produce are all equally invalid. Not that I am against stating an argument consciously or poetically but they aren't. They throw short diatribes and simple contradictions around as if it was something meaningful. To say you don't actually wish to argue, that is fine and well. That leaves you only commenting though. The truly improper posts are those which will not argue but also make assertions as if they had.","debating-creationist","06:21 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","41"
