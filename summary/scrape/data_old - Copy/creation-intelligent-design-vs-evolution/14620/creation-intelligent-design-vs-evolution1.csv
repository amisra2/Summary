"09-16-2010","14620",1,"None","None","None","Ripskar","412577","In essence it comes from our training, essentially you are responding to the display of ignorance by attempting to correct and educate. This is inevitably doomed to failure because you aren't talking to a student who wants to learn, instead you've got an ideologue with an axe to grind and no concept of compromise. The best thing to do (if you don't wish to simply ignore them) is to ridicule them as this turns the tables back with psychology, they'll find that they are the ones getting the stick for no carrot and eventually go elsewhere. You should be able to take a newbie creationist to the point of leaving in 7 to 14 days, sometimes even less.","debating-creationist","03:13 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","7"

Indeed as Benedict points out in the OP, attempting to is rather pointless. the question then is what are they here for? They are almost invariably adolescent males, they are flooded with testosterone and desperate to challenge for dominance - carrying out the dictates of their genetic instructions. As such their first post is invariably a general challenge, same as that of any vertebrate male. Bellow, beat your chest, puff your self up, roll in your own scent. What will instantly deflate them is humour, sharpest blade in the kit. Ridicule prevents them from claiming dominance. That is why they leave in days.","debating-creationist","04:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","9"

However you can communicate in a manner they will understand.

I most certainly am male and therefore have testosterone. Is that why I am doing this? Not in the least. I do this because I am forced to spend 2 hours a day in a computer lab as I wait for my little brother to finish classes. I came into this knowing that it is impossible to convince anyone to change their viewpoint in an online forum. What I aslo know is that ""iron sharpens iron"" (a Biblical reference. I know you could never have known that) and the more I do this the better I will become for the time when I see one of you (you meaning an evolutionist) in person, I can be far more eloquent and have answers ready instead of attempting to figure things out mid-conversation. I hope this clears your apparent fog, --Fartingle","debating-creationist","04:56 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","15"
