The likes of SuperSport and Wascally Wabbit proved fine examples of the ridiculousness of creationist beliefs, neither attempts to post now. Not counting the one post wonders the quickest for a creationist disappearing was 3 days. As for you. Your beliefs were ridiculed by another creationist who also told you that the atheists would rip you to shreds.

As for creationists not lasting long Archangel was arguing the case for years and Easy( I think he is a creationist) is still here. A lot of posters leave this forum quickly and they are not all creationists so your argument is rubbish.","debating-creationist","05:51 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"

I believe God created the universe but I dont know what God is exactly and I dont believe that God is found in science. I actually believe that debating whether God created the universe is pointless.","debating-creationist","05:58 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","18"

ID.","debating-creationist","07:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","21"
"09-16-2010","14620",2,"fartingle","412602","You have yet to do anything of the type. You seem to have come to a conclusion based on your own stupidity. I most certainly am male and therefore have testosterone. Is that why I am doing this? Not in the least. I do this because I am forced to spend 2 hours a day in a computer lab as I wait for my little brother to finish classes. I came into this knowing that it is impossible to convince anyone to change their viewpoint in an online forum. What I aslo know is that ""iron sharpens iron"" (a Biblical reference. I know you could never have known that) and the more I do this the better I will become for the time when I see one of you (you meaning an evolutionist) in person, I can be far more eloquent and have answers ready instead of attempting to figure things out mid-conversation. I hope this clears your apparent fog, --Fartingle","Bennedict","412622","i get the feeling that you are young yourself, probably still in grade school, correct? in response to ripskar, i disagree slightly, i think a creationists doesnt have to be male or adolescent. on this forum, yes but most of the people who post here are dudes. i think creationists dont necessarily fit any mold, just people who have been brought up from birth to think that the bible is absolute truth and you cannot question it, and they retaliate when people do question the bible, and as evolution indirectly questions the bible, creationists are born. and with all things that people learn at a young age, the older the creationist gets, the stronger their position on creationism becomes despite being wrong. so hopefully fartingle is not in the group of old people that cant change their way of thinking despite being incorrect. I HAVE HOPE FOR YOU!!!!!","debating-creationist","07:11 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","22"

It's the ones who enter a forum like this to challenge an atheist. It's not just this forum, most P&R forums I've seen are awash with adolescents.","debating-creationist","07:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","23"

No adolescent, he's guilty of violating virtually every forum rule on the list, and is by consensus considered the forum's resident Wacko Fundie Klass Klown. Yet in his mind , he thinks he's scoring major points with some imagined audience of fans (regardless of the fact that he himself has been ""BUSTED!""--decisively, empirically, indisputably-- countless times) and masochistically comes back, day after day, sometimes well into the early hours of the morning, for still further ridicule. (Hey, would I return to a forum where, after years of posting, was cybernetically abused every time I posted? Would you? ) This is your classic ""martyr"": arguing with him simply proves his ""point""--which is that everyone but him is on a greasy slide to hell, don't you quote the Bible at ME as evidence, damn you all, Jesus would WANT me to call you scum, blah blah blah... This is the type who figures he can be as obnoxious, insulting, irrational, and un-Christ-like (in the generally accepted sense) as he pleases, because HE knows--KNOWS--that God has his back. (And if you doubt it, YOU'RE DAMNED TO HELL, CHRIST-DENIER!...) He's not trying to convert or persuade anybody but himself: that, crappy as his reality must be, everyone else is wrong and will burn for it, and he and he alone is promised a happy afterlife for fighting the good fight and staying true to the self-contradictory, sometimes savage commands of his bearded sky-pixie. He's even less worthy of debate than freedom or fart, but since he's more outrageously amusing (his detractors' posts are, anyway), people can't resist egging him on to new heights of ad hominem thunderation. He's like that loony-tunes Florida preacher/would-be Koran-burner: congregation of 50, yet SO ""out there"" you can't NOT look away.","debating-creationist","08:32 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","25"

I was also a firm believer in creation and the infallability of the bible. I joined an old yahoo group (back when yahoo groups were actually cool) and argued strongly against evolution and in support of creation. The first thing I learned was that what I was arguing against wasn't evolution, and that I didn't know what evolution was. So I took it upon myself to learn what evolution was so I could arm myself with more effective arguments. The next thing I learned was that evolution was a proven fact that didn't contradict anything in the bible. The third thing I learned was that there was a mountain of physical and scientific evidence that contradicted what I believed the bible said about the origin of the earth. Once I was faced with the dilema of contradicting options, concerning a decision which I think is of utmost importance, I started to dig for more evidence, for unbiased reports that supported either side. The more I dug, the more it was revealed that what the bible says is in many ways contrary to reality. This was the beginning of my journey into atheism. Debating evolution with a creationist isn't pointless. Debating with a closed-minded person, regardless of the topic, always is.","debating-creationist","12:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","26"

He usually just makes some scripture reference rather than actually arguing a point. All you have to do is demonstrate that scripture is pointless. To that I have a copy of the Hindu stuff which I can quote at him. That usually does the trick.","debating-creationist","03:02 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","27"

Sir, iron sharpening iron refers to the act of two believers encouraging each other, not one christian irritating nonbelievers and entrenching their views ever so permanently. Of course they don't believe, they don't believe in the Bible. Biblical evidence will never amount to anything in their eyes. You need another approach.
