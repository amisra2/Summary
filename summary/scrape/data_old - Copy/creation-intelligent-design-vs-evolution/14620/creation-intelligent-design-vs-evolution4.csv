"09-22-2010","14620",4,"Bennedict","413183","last year, one of my professors said that theres nothing he dislikes more than people who think wikipedia is not a reliable source. he said that wikipedia doesnt have the final say, but it always has the first say and thats exactly what creationists need, the first say because every single creationist that ive ever come across knows so little about science and biology that they need the basics of wikipedia to get them up to speed. i too was not able to use wikipedia for reference in high school (this is when wikipedia was in its first stages), and i argued with the teachers for quite some time. i found that the subjects my teachers were teaching could be found in wikipedia. youre probably thinking of blog articles when i said research articles... in which case you are reading the wrong blogs! research articles are not written by yarbowls who think they know all and post articles on their blogspace or whatever, they are scientists who do research and write articles about their research. who cares if it say 'and therefore evolution...'? like i said, you cant ignore information and then claim that you have never been shown wrong. caring for the well being of a person's soul is an emotional issue which is hard to get across on the internet, but straight up information is shockingly easy. i dont care about emotional issues, my emotional issues are my own and you cant shove religion in my face and tell me that youre caring for the well being of my soul and expect me to change my emotional issues based on that. my atheism comes from emotional issues but i keep them to myself. but if you make false scientific claims, i and everyone else will dispute them with proper information.","fartingle","413347","I have not been shown. I have been told that I am wrong many times, but that lacks merit. There are many articles and books presenting ""global warming"" as a fact even though it has been proven wrong and driven by scientists wanting to make money. So articles by ""experts"" and ""scientists"" that are being paid to make things up are not valid until expiraments are done, repeated, and shown to others. But it is a necessary part of Christianity. If I present straight facts, they are denied as ""religious bull"" and I am disregarded.","debating-creationist","03:19 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","51"

It is a metaphor for a specific process of becoming stronger by the friction between two like minds. There are other methods of making one stronger that this metaphor doesn't apply to. That's quite a claim! Sounds like a challenge to me... How exactly is an article on the internet, or from wikipedia, less reliable than a professional book, academic text, or biblical scripture? How does the media that the information is found on determine how valid it is? I distinctly remember myself saying I was pentecostal. Its not always necessary to appeal to emotions to convey your point. In fact, I personally tend to acknowledge the rational merits of a person's arguments much more than ""how much they care"", but that's just me. In a debate forum, ideas rule, feelings often get trampled.","fartingle","413348","I said it before to Bennedict, I have only been told that I am wrong. It is completely different. I was also told by people that Obama would do some good. Doctors told people that smoking had little to no connection to lung cancer (obviously that was a while ago). It is called application. The process happens regardless of the people. The context of the verse happened to be in a letter to a church. It is not hard to say when you look at how many people have neither read the Bible nor care to. There are also many people are not too bright as you all have talked about the people who get stuck on the first questions every time. Internet information is constantly changing and can be editted by anyone. Some books are poor sources as well (have you seen what is happening to textbooks today?). I apologise. I thought you said you were raised Catholic in a different thread. Well you then end up with what someone said earlier about me being some angry person trying to act tough.","debating-creationist","03:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","52"

The temperature trend graphs that were changed to make it seem as if a warm period was new? The real satelite pictures of the ice caps? Besides those, do you not go outside? I believe it was the 70's when they saw a new ice age coming. Where I live had a record cold winter this past year (admittedly that does not mean it was that cold, but we did get below freezing in Phoenix!). Common sense is adequate for something so blatently false. Again, the scientists were paid more and more when they ""found evidence"" supporting it. There was even some guy (I think he was the only one this crazy) that tried to get countries to unite under his control to fight global warming.","debating-creationist","04:41 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","54"
