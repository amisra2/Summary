You need to give evidence against both the books of the Old Testament as well as the New Testament. Self-discovery is okay as long as you are saved from your sin. If God were to come down in all of his glory right now, you'd be 'like the chaff that the wind drives away'. You, obviously, need to be saved from your sin. We all do. Accept Jesus into your heart ASAP. You don't need to read the Bible or even go to Church, just spread the Good News about Him. It's 'feinds', not fiends. Jeeze.","chemist99a","285130","Nope, the creation is only described in the OT, not in the NT. All the claims are OT and thats long before Christ and Christianity. What one discovers of course is that SIN (esp original SIN) is a guilt trap designed to enslave one to some religious authority who can bail you out, and that there is neither SIN nor the authority. This represents genuine salvation from the burden that organized Christian religons would place on your shoulders. Sorry but I cannot in good faith spread concepts and ideas which I find to be backwards and invalid. I leave that to you and yours.","challenge-both-sides","11:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","46"

But don't worry, many people do. Yes *braces for reply* Pretty sad, huh?","snakespit","285140","Christianity. Are you unfamiliar with Phelps? In your opinion. You opinion means jack spit to me. I have no need for a savior. I have no desire to be saved. Newsflash for ya chief (or should I say cheif for you?)...not everyone subscribes to your personal philosophy. Why not worry about yourself and let the rest of us worry about ourselves? Yet you fail to embrace the irony. People forming their own opinions and believing what they feel works best for them...yes, sad indeed.","challenge-both-sides","02:01 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","48"

Anyway, evos haven't disproved either wrong, so, it doesn't matter yet. When you sin, do something wrong or bad. I challenge you all to go through an entire day without even committing even one single sin. Once you realize how hard that is, try keeping track of how many sins you commit daily. Maybe then you'll see why we need a savior.","challenge-both-sides","11:23 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","49"

Just a reminder: everyone, including Christians, sin. I am unfamiliar with Phelps, apparently for a good reason. I feel sorry for you. Only a 'jack spitter' wouldn't. I am surprised at your stalling, why not just inform me of this irony directly? Ya, have you ever heard of scientology?

"09-26-2007","10376",4,"feindslayer","285114","The foundation for Christianity rests on whether or not Jesus was God's son. This is a literal story because it has written, historical evidence (which has always worked for proof in the past), the Bible, for confirmation.","unkerpaulie","285234","the foundation for christianity is whether man is born in sin. if there was no original sin, then there would be no need for jesus, be he god's son or not. on touching historical evidence, every major event in the bible has been shown to be either grossly exagerrated or simply not true at all.","challenge-both-sides","12:21 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","52"
"09-26-2007","10376",4,"marc9000","285124","That's exactly right - very well said. If you simply eliminate the phrase of yours that I highlighted, actual Christians like me and honest atheists (or agnostics) like you could agree on this and live together in peace. I believe it was largely that way in the U.S. 100 years ago. But government is too big for it to be that way today.","unkerpaulie","285235","i totally agree. the problem is that facts and evidence have an annoying habit of existing and being true, and they are pretty difficult to ignore","challenge-both-sides","12:24 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","53"
"09-26-2007","10376",4,"Vinterland","285236","The tone of recent discussion in this thread leads me to believe you are serious! To make such a statement full of gnosticism must in fact mean you know something everyone else doesn't. Will you reveal your secret mystical knowledge to us? Now I wonder how you know that...oh that's right, you have faith! Strong-atheists need something to hold onto don't they? Honestly, provide at least some evidence to substantiate your claim or your beliefs are nothing more than delusions. In response to the OP, I'm a bit disappointed, but not shocked to see this topic degenerate so quickly into a battle of insults because though I am new to this particular forum I see the same garbage everywhere else. I care not to contribute to the original discussion myself, but I will echo those who stated literal creationism has been debunked and that Big Bang-creationism is an almost an unassailable position.","pandion","285242","Why would you imagine otherwise? Do you think that your religious views are somehow intuitively evident? Why so? Why is your superstition somehow true in the face of reality? No. It means that he is unwilling to accept your assertions of truth based on the mythology of bronze age, nomadic herdsmen. But he didn't claim any secret mystical knowledge. He expressed a disbelief in your claims to mystical knowledge. But he isn't expressing belief. He is expressing disbelief in your delusions. Why is it that you can't actually provide any evidence to substantiate your claims? How is that a response to the OP? Why do you feel that pointing out ignorance is an insult? Then why did you post anything at all if you have nothing to add? What the frack is ""Big Bang-creationism""? For Christ's sake, try to make sense.","challenge-both-sides","01:44 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","55"

Anyway, evos haven't disproved either wrong, so, it doesn't matter yet.","chemist99a","285247","Well you are correct. Evolutionists have not disproved either wrong - which translates as NOT(dispoved) = proved. Thence to ""have proven neither wrong"". And given that creation by an omnipotent being is neither provable or disprovable because its non-scientific evolutionists (or scientists in general) are not likely to undertake the task. Any more than you are likely to attempt to prove that that same being did not create it all last Tuesday at noon. However certain empirical claims made by creationists are NOT in accord with the physical evidence of the Earths age or history. Scientifically those claims can be cosidered to be disproven.","challenge-both-sides","02:32 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","57"

Yet another person using 'faith' as if it applied to everything from the existence of an almighty super being to whether I had cornflakes for breakfast or not. The only evidence *for* a cosmic ethical adjudicator is a cobbled-together set of books claiming that a talking snake made our ancestors commit a ""sin"" (when they didn't even know what a sin was) which could easily have been avoided if he had put the tree in an out of the way place rather than in the middle of the garden where they lived - all of which he had to know about in advance being omniscient - then after a few botched attempts at sorting things out, he sent an avatar of himself to soak up the blame for this ""sin"" which apparently follows down the family lines like some genetic defect! Does this make sense to you?! What exactly are you after evidence *for*?","challenge-both-sides","04:47 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","58"

Therefore, it is a statement of faith made by a believer in whatever his or her dogma is. Perhaps not, but I don't believe it is unreasonable assumption for myself to make of his beliefs that because he believes Jesus Christ is fiction, he consequently believes the Christian God is fiction aswell. The story of Christ can be tested by history, but the Christian God is in another realm and one would require mystical knowledge in order to state said God does or does not exist. Indeed he is as disbelief is still belief - he expresses the denial of God which is unique to strong atheists. Furthermore, he claims that Doctrine essential to Christianity is wrong. I've heard this all before...but where...oh, that's right, from Richard Dawkins! I have not made any claims here other than this: ""your beliefs are based on faith."" It was the strong-atheists I responded to that first claimed an absolute, therefore the burden of proof would be on them to evidence Jesus Christ is a fictional character and that Sin is a man-made concept. I did add, but as I clearly stated, it does not pertain to the original discussion about evidence for or against God because I am not providing evidence for or against God. I made it up, and I can explain it in a few sentences. I will reference to the label of ""literal-creationism"" which is obviously creationism as the Bible states it literally happened (6,000 years ago). ""Big-Bang creationism"" would simply be creationism reconciled with the Big Bang, abiogenesis, and evolution. God, in all His creativity, setup the Big Bang and let the ball start rolling, so to speak. I agree, Ockham's Razor eliminates the need for God, however, people will believe what they want. Who are you to and other strong-atheists to evangelize your beliefs to eveyone? ""God does not exist"", and ""Sin is a fairy tale to scare people"", etc, etc, etc.","challenge-both-sides","05:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","60"
