"09-27-2007","10376",8,"chemist99a","285521","Really? So how good a job did their Christian parents and ministers do in instilling a strong faith in such students in the first place. Sorry but fair weather christians are not true believers. They are just social Christians who like the social aspects of organized religion. You cannot shake a true believer with a few facts or even with well founded theories. And if its due to hormones - well creationists believe thats the design and they know who to complain to. All the atheists I know do not believe that their persons survive their own deaths. Eternal consequences there may be (who can predict the effects of ones actions even a 1000 years in the future), but the athesists I know do not anticipate that those consequences will impact them. Sure they are. Human beings are stubborn entities and many of us will fight to defend our beliefs even when facts to the contrary begin to accumulate. All the atheists I know are human. Us scientist agnostics are as bad about that as any others, but we are trained to give our beliefs up when the evidence runs to much against our ideas. For example Fred Hoyle held tightly to the steady state theory of the universe until the evidence in support of th Big Bang model became overwhelmingly more convincing - and of course the BB itself may be overwhelmed in the future. Hoyle was about the last holdout though.","marc9000","285540","So if a college student that's raised well goes bad, it's not his fault, it's the fault of those who raised him? It seems that evolutionists are almost always Democrats. Atheists who claim the Bible isn't important? (the Bible that suggests controlling those hormones) The question was, would new facts change their minds about that? I sure would like to know more about that training. Is it integrated into science classes, or is it a separate class? Are scientists trained to hold out longer on this ""giving up"", depending on what their pay scale is? The likelihood of their expertise obtaining research grants for universities?","challenge-both-sides","09:24 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","106"

Thats called seeing the light and being born again intellectually. If such a revelation to the student is distasteful to the parents etc they are free to refute the students new beliefs. Thus it always is. Humans all have the option of evaluating the logic and arguments they come across in life. No sane person would have it be otherwise. Yes Democrats are often more committed to reason and logic than are Republicans. I do not know why, but its observationally true. Except of course you cannot (short of say chemical castration) CONTROL those hormones they are not under voluntary control. New facts are always to be considered carefully. Precisely what new facts would you like to put on the table? The best way is to go out and get your PhD in a field like biology or chemistry or physics. Enjoy. A good scientist will NOT glue themselves to a failed hypothesis or theory. You cannot do science if you cannot let go of your pets.","challenge-both-sides","09:52 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","107"
"09-27-2007","10376",8,"chemist99a","285523","I know the doctrine of Christians, that doctrine requires that their beliefs rest on faith not upon facts. Read the bible its all in there. And of course since I grew up in the Bible Belt and have now retired back to the same region, I am surrounded by Christians and have ample opportunity to observe their behaviors and discuss their beliefs. Thats very true. Atheism is much much older than evolution as is not founded on Darwin or his successors. Its founded on empirical evidence and logic, however it is a BELIEF and is not subject to either proof or disproof. Science itself is agnostic. It makes no affirmations of either theology or its complement (atheism). My personal belief is that atheism is valid. My scientific work is strictly agnostic and does not invoke GOD or the non-existense of GOD. Panic? Do you think that if evolution vanished tomorrow as a viable theory that atheism would be impacted? How so? Atheism has a lot more going for it than Science (which in fact does not support either Atheism or Theism) or evolution (which is also agnostic not atheistic). Biologists would not discard evolution unless and until a more satisfactory theory was worked out. Noble prizes would be awarded, PhDs would be earned, new knowledge would be gained and good time would be had by all. Certainly not panic. And unless somehow it was found necessary to invoke GOD as an explanation of the new theory (something the rules of science strictly forbid!) the atheists would have no reason to reconsider their beliefs! Ah ha the GUP20 thread. Unfortunately you are not seeing panic, you are merely observing the normal debate and shaking out which is applied to any scientific theory. There are severe scientific problems with the hypothesis presented by GUP20 and the responses point them out. Why should GUP20 not be informed of these problems with what he proposed?","marc9000","285548","Where does it say to disregard facts?? Why do you take an interest in that? Are you interested in converting them? What would that evidence and logic be, without Darwin? Details of Darwins life show that his success was largely because he filled a gap that atheists needed. Mindless scientific processes caused people to flock his way. Not when it's called upon to make political decisions, concerning tradition and religion. If only Richard Dawkins (and the millions who buy his books) were like you. It would take political hits that would destroy it financially. The ACLU president would be out hunting aluminum cans. The American Atheists website would go down. The Academic Bill of Rights would be established at all U.S. universities. Oh, the list is long. Billions of dollars would change hands, so a good time would definitely not be had by all. There will be no more satisfactory theories. The courts will see to it. Who made these ""rules of science""? Most of the links in post #2 were rabid atheist sites. Do you consider a site entitled ""no answers in genesis"" a thoughtful, scientific site? Wouldn't one link have been enough? Maybe not, because it would have inspired an actual debate. The ""shaking out"" process is actually a SNUFFING OUT. A warlike destruction of time and recources, of anyone even thinking about researching a young earth. Any new evidence for a young earth doesn't just challange evolution, it completely destroys it. Evolution has to have an ancient earth, billions of times around the sun with no variation, no gravitational changes, etc. Evidence against all that mathematically imposible luck - it's probably the one thing that evolutionists and atheists fear the most.","challenge-both-sides","10:07 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","108"

After all if the evidence indicates a very ancient earth then thats just a temptation to test ones faith is it not? Nope, I do not convert nor am I convertable. Conversion is not my thing if people hold mistaken ideas thats their problem. I might argue with them but its no foul if they disagree. Nope he produced the first credible scientific description of a process which could lead to the observed diversity of living organisms. Previously the ideas all invoked intelligence, or non-material causes. Just as organic chemistry did until Wohler. And of course to be sceintific only material causes can be invoked in a scientific theory. And once more with feeling - ATHEISM preceded Darwin and indeed preceded western science by centuries and centuries. Darwin did not invent it, Darwin did not advocate it. Darwin set out to explain how species might evolve a biological problem rather than a problem in theology or subjective belief. Sorry but science is agnostic no matter what forum it finds itself in. Its the nature of the beast. You think it atheistic simply because its not supportive of your beliefs in GOD. I have met others who think science is theistic because it does not claim to falsify the existense of GOD. Truth is that science when asked about GOD has to say ""I don't know"" which is the default hypothesis. To answer otherwise as a scientist is not logical. Dawkins is operating outside the limits of science if and when he claims to be able to state that GOD does not exist. At best he could answer that he does not (as a scientist) know. He like everyone else is perfectly free to express his personal belief. I for example personally believe that atheisim is valid, but I do not state that within a scientific contest - its a personal belief. What a chuckle. Atheism is a belief not an organization like say a megachurch which preaches against any rational belief which conflicts with the operators personal preferences. And often the ACLU defends Annon-scientific conflicts - the ACLU is interested in civil liberties and law neither one of which are scientific in nature. As to the American Atheists website - well probably not such a thing is easily funded out of small change these days. As to the ""Academic Bill or Rights"" do you have a copy of that document somewhere? And why do you think it should be established anywhere at all? Billions of dollars change hands every day big deal. And if you think that there never being any satisfactory theories is a good idea then you are the enemy of the human enterprise. And if you intend to enforce unsatisfactory theories such as creationism through the courts - well you might do it, but you will eventually be most unhappy with the outcome. Practioners of the noble art and craft of doing science - who else? There are no links in post #2. I posted it, I just reread it. What are you talking about? You could not be referring to this could you? http://www.4forums.com/political/member.php?u=6183 Can you find any links there? Ignoring the first part since I find no links to examine, As to snuffing out , the budget of a single megachurch for a year or two would easily fund a large and concerted effort to research the problem. Perhaps the mega evanglists should fund some private research using a grants mechanism. Much of the research done in the US is in fact done privately in non-academic institutions. The DI for example is actively seeking research work to establish the scientific validity of ID. All it takes is money and dedication and certainly they have plenty of both. I look forward to reading and evaluating their results when they publish. Don't you? First of all you have to have such evidence and then it has to be evaluated carefully. So far as I can see no credible evidence supporting a 6000 year old earth has yet emerged nor has credible evidence which would falsify the current hypothesis. But yes you are correct if the earth is only 6000 years old then Darwinian evolution would be down the tubes. Now show that the earth is only 6000 years old and ya got it made. An ancient earth is necessary. An earth which does not change for billions of years is NOT necessary, environmental variation is important to evolution in fact. As to mathematically impossible - well if you play the lottery for a billion years something is likely to turn up in your favor! And scientists do not fear a young earth, they just have confidence that its a failed hypothesis and that the current estimates are the best fit to the available observations. If you have credible new data to the contrary then put it on the table. You could change the world and win fame and fortune after all.","challenge-both-sides","10:51 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","109"

"09-28-2007","10376",8,"marc9000","285469","Geology is not ONLY about prehistoric proclamations. It's about making use of what we actually have today. Did you know that there are petroleum geologists who are Christians? Who take an interest in geology that supports what the Bible says?","Waxy","285586","What we have today is the result of millions of years of geological history. I know many petroleum geologists personally that are Christian or Catholic. Not a single one of them subscribes to a young earth hypothesis. I know your answer will simply be to state they are not Christians then, according to your definition. Last I checked, stating that you were a YEC was not high on the list of qualifications for getting hired as a petroleum geologist. There are definitely a few geologist out there that work backwards - take what's written in the Bible and then try to make the geology fit the story. However, they are very few and very far between, and their research is easily refuted. The fact of the matter is, you don't need ""evolution"", in any sense of the word, including your all encompassing definition, to prove the genesis story wrong if read literally. Any one of the natural physical sciences - geology, physics, chemistry, geography, etc..., alone, and particularly in combination, proves the literal reading of the Genesis account wrong, and therefore, according to your position, proves all of Christianity wrong.

Maybe you can postulate a god as the prime mover of the big bang, I don't know why you'd want to, but i suppose you could. After that, the laws of physics take over, and evolution is the result. Even if one were to suppose a god initiated the big bang, there is no reason to suppose it took an interest in subsequent events, or nudged them down one path as opposed to any other. Evolution doesn't need a deity in its daily operation... that's why it works so well as science!","challenge-both-sides","03:11 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","115"

Suppose satalites were launched in orbit around the earth, with any changes in their distances carefully recorded after hundreds, or thousands of revolutions. Progressive changes in their distances from earth, an inch today, a foot tomorrow, 500 feet the day after. Suppose all collected information clearly showed that the earth could not possibly go around the sun more than........50 million times before drifting away, or being drawn in. Do you think that would be made public? It would turn most of the scientific community on its head. You think it would - I don't think it would. I'm a patriotic American, I was 15 years old in 1969. I believed we put a man on the moon until just a few years ago. Somebody told me to watch a VHS tape that proved it false, that analyzed the documentation of those moon trips, with todays technology and a critical eye. My mind was made up not to believe it as I started watching, but when it was done I knew - it was all a scientific con game. When science has the money, it can make us believe anything it wants. I must admit, even in 1969 I was wondering why the spacemen weren't jumping 25 feet off the ground there, since gravity was supposed to be 1/6 of the earths. They would jump about 3 feet, hang there a little, (slowed down tape) and settle back down. The tape showed no star canopy from the moon. (can't see stars when there's no air, according to NASA) Also can't reproduce a perfect star canopy on a movie set, can we NASA? The shadows were a big part of the analogy. They couldn't reproduce one light source with the distance away as the sun. The shadows clearly showed it. Lost a lot of my faith in science that day. The money they spent on that farce was a drop in the bucket compared to the money they'd lose if a billions-of-years-old-earth was clearly disproved. They're simply not going to study it. If a billions-of-year-old earth was disproved, would you lose your atheism?","challenge-both-sides","09:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","120"
