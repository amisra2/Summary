Or would you prefer that rather than stating their honest and best considered opinions that they lie to you and give you an opinion which their best judgement says is wrong? Geez you are just asking for deep deep trouble.","marc9000","285971","They STOPPED SHORT when they blocked ID. They need to stop short when they promote atheism. They brought it on themselves, with their double standard.","challenge-both-sides","07:57 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","181"
"10-01-2007","10376",13,"chemist99a","285758","Dawkins is like yourself a free agent so far as his opinions go. Nowhere that I know of has he claimed to have a scientific falsification of the GOD hypothesis. Its clear to all concerned that he is expressing his opinion - which is what he is entitled to do as a person. He bases his opinion upon what he knows of science and his opinion is that the GOD hypothesis is most most unlikely. That happens to be my opinion also and I to do not claim to have a scientific falsification of the GOD hypothesis. In principle it cannot be falsified scientifically and I do not know it to be false. But I do judge it to be minimally likely. In summary Science and scientists cannot do science and remain neutral on matters of social and political debate. Its literally impossible since the science will almost certainly support one side of such debates more than another. Nope in any issue where a scientific conclusion (and by that I mean a formal conclusion) can be reached its very unlikely that that conclusion will support every social-political viewpoint equally. Thus such a conclusion cannot be neutral even though it may be (and should be) scientifically objective. As the courtroom formulation goes - ""To a near scientific certainty these data mean that......."" Scientists should be truthful you know thats one of the ideals of the field.","marc9000","285972","So block one in the courts, and let the other flow freely. Give one public funding and exposure in public education, and let the other have at it on its own. BLOCK free and open dissection of it all. But do they all make it to court? Who determines if some scientific theory should be scrutinized by a court? Someone with money and an agenda, yes. Who else??","challenge-both-sides","08:07 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","182"
"10-01-2007","10376",13,"chemist99a","285832","I Tell ya what, move 100 lightyears from earth, now look at it with a telescope. See anything made by man, computers for example? Human bodies? OK now come back to earth and look at where you were. See any bodies, any computers, any life? Well do ya?","marc9000","285973","Science declares that the Milky Way Galaxy is about 100,000 light years across. It seems like if that and all other details of the galaxy can be proclaimed, finding some complexity in near stars/planets shouldn't be much of a challange.","challenge-both-sides","08:13 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","183"
"10-01-2007","10376",13,"chemist99a","285855","Ah but we do. Namely that linages of organisms have evolved, and that the empirical evidence demonstrates precisely that. As to how life originated, well biologists and chemists are working on the possible routes of abiogenesis and the nut may eventually crack. In the meantime humans have made one of the implist lifeforms from organic chemicals. We don't how nature did it yet, but we do know how it can be done! Next stop of course is to make a more complex lifeform like a bacterium - preferably a minimal one containing only the geneome necessary for life.","marc9000","285974","How do you think this would do if it were taken to court? I know atheists love it and they are very skilled at making hopes and dreams look like facts. If they throw out improbability it's a big help to them also. When I get more time I'll have to look at your Dover links and see if probabilities and improbabilities were mentioned anywhere in that case.","challenge-both-sides","08:19 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","184"
"10-01-2007","10376",13,"chemist99a","285856","My question. Your evasion: I repeat the question since you failed to respond. Do you think the large amount of evidence that the earth is NOT flat indicates that the evidence is biased against the flat earthers? Please try to grasp the issue. Its NOT whether the earth is flat or not, its whether the evidence for a round earth (which is plentiful) creates a bias against the belief that the earth is flat simply because there is much more evidence for a round earth than a flat one.","marc9000","285975","No, it's not biased. It's logical evidence, much the same as improbability is logical evidence. In the same way, do you believe the improbabilities of evolution (which are plentiful) creates a bias against evolution simply because there remains so many in the general public who refuse to accept godless evolution just because atheist scientists say they should?","challenge-both-sides","08:31 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","185"
"10-01-2007","10376",13,"Peeling","285899","So your explanation for the lack of such evidence is that it's being repressed, rather than that it doesn't exist? Scientists love turning the world on its head. It's the devoutly religious such as yourself who have cenophobia. Oh dear... Here's an experiment you can do in your own home. Put on an old diving suit and pressurize it to 2 bar. Now try jumping 3 feet in the air. Ever noticed how few stars are visible on a night when the moon is full? I happen to be an amateur astrophotographer, and I know that if I want to take a picture of a starscape I have to crank the ISO up to 1600 and leave the shutter open for a couple of minutes, otherwise nothing will register. However, I can take a picture of the moon at low ISO in 1/500th second, a difference in brightness of about 480,000. It's impossible to expose both the moon and stars correctly in the same shot - I invite you to find a picture anywhere that contradicts this. Either the moon will be a white disc, or the stars will be invisible. Exposures based on the brightness of the moon's surface inevitably make the sky appear black. No marc, they didn't . Acquaint yourself with a concept known as 'perspective'. Also, the 'halo' effect sometimes mentioned is visible right here on earth. Go up in a light aircraft on a sunny day and watch the plane's shadow. As you fly higher and higher you'll notice a bright 'halo' appear around it. This happens because you can't see any shadows in that area: all shadows are hidden behind the objects casting them, be they buildings or blades of grass.","marc9000","285976","Well, it's been awhile since I've had anything to say to YOU. Did the Roman general public, in about 450 AD, have cenophobia? It's kind of curious how no one here has asked for my source. Kind of like those head-in-the-sand Christians who never ask for scientific evidence, isn't it? It's a good thing really, because I don't have it. I didn't note the names of who produced it, and it was borrowed. I may try to find it again. I just remembered another good part - in one freeze frame, there was a soft drink bottle on the lunar surface!! Apparantly they weren't the first ones there!! No special holes in the face plates for 60's style glass bottles!! Another thing that creates doubt about the moon landings is the time gone by - the seeming lack of interest over the last 28 years. There was a newpaper article about 5 years ago that I wish I'd kept, but didn't, probably because I remember what it said so clearly. The question was asked about future moon visits, and unfortunately if we go back it has to be done completely from scratch. It seems that ALL knowledge and records of it have been lost. Darn cleanin ladies!!!!!! You'd think after all the millions of tax dollars spent a little better eye would have been kept out for them! I could do it if I had overhead wires attached to me!!! Freeze frames showed the light shimmering off them hahahahahaha NO. Except for a small area around the moon, they are everywhere! Photography has improved greatly since 1969. If they go back, maybe they'll be able to get some star canopy pictures. May be kind of improbable though. But that doesn't stop evolution!! ""Perspective"" is what it was all about. A huge, artifical light on a movie set can't duplicate a light that's actually 93 million miles away. If two planes are flying 50 feet away from each other, the shadows will be 50 feet away from each other on the ground, if it's actually the sun making the shadows. If it's an artificial light, they will not. At first glance the shadows from your link don't look as contrasted as what I saw in that tape. I'll have to check it out more carefully. Didn't notice a ""halo"" on the moon, just a pop bottle.","challenge-both-sides","09:07 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","186"

You all were replying faster than I could disprove. I would love to take any one of you on in a formal debate, however. That way, I can conquer you all one at a time.... I'll debate the first person to accept my challenge.","marc9000","285978","That's a definite pattern at 4forums. I'd love to watch it.
