"10-02-2007","10376",14,"marc9000","285976","I just remembered another good part - in one freeze frame, there was a soft drink bottle on the lunar surface!! Apparantly they weren't the first ones there!! No special holes in the face plates for 60's style glass bottles!! The question was asked about future moon visits, and unfortunately if we go back it has to be done completely from scratch. It seems that ALL knowledge and records of it have been lost. Darn cleanin ladies!!!!!! You'd think after all the millions of tax dollars spent a little better eye would have been kept out for them! I could do it if I had overhead wires attached to me!!! Freeze frames showed the light shimmering off them hahahahahaha NO. Except for a small area around the moon, they are everywhere! Photography has improved greatly since 1969. ""Perspective"" is what it was all about. A huge, artifical light on a movie set can't duplicate a light that's actually 93 million miles away.","Peeling","285996","It's funny, though - none of the 'moon landings were faked' sites actually have an image of that soft drink bottle. The claims are based on what a handful of people thought they saw for a split second on their 1950's tv sets - in fuzzy black and white. NASA no longer have a functional rocket capable of lunar insertion, so yes, they would have to start from scratch. And they would probably not be allowed to use the same technology, since health and safety was a little more... relaxed during the cold war. No, they show light shimmering off the few inches of aerial that juts out of the backpack. No glints anywhere higher up. And you can clearly see from the footage that the astronaut is not 'dangling' from his pack as would be mandated by such an arrangement. Oh really? You can clearly see the Milky Way on a night with a full moon? How about if the moon were ten times closer? Or you were stood on it? You know, if it were effectively daytime. Not in terms of dynamic range it hasn't. Ansel Adams managed to eke ten stops of detail out of black and white film using special processing techniques. That's a contrast ratio of around 1024-1. But to get the full moon exposed as anything other than a pure white disc and still pick up Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, you would need a dynamic range of over 10,000-1. If perspective is what it was all about, why are you talking about something completely different? Perspective is why shadows that are in fact parallel appear to converge as they recede from the viewer. Some 'fake' sites claim multiple lights were used. For heaven's sake, why would they do that? ""Hey, guys, I know we're trying to fake the moon landing and all but I'm really not happy with the lighting I'm getting here; could you rig up a few more spots?"" Any hypothesis that requires thousands of ordinary people to be masterfully cunning and tight-lipped conspirators and thundering XXXXXX should be setting off alarm bells all over your head. Indeed, the fact it doesn't speaks volumes for how you look at the world. The fake lunar landing 'conspiracy'; the great atheist 'conspiracy'. Everywhere you look, people are conspiring against you, out to fool you, make you look stupid, attack your beliefs, and you're ready and willing to swallow anything , no matter how ridiculous or poorly thought out, so long as it panders to that paranoia. I would not like to live in the world you inhabit, marc.","challenge-both-sides","04:36 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","198"

That's something you are going to have to live with as a fact. Unfortunately, evolution is not something you get to vote down and pretend it isn't true. It's real whether you accept it or not, no matter how intensely you deny it or not. Same goes for the assorted cranks who insist the laws of thermodynamics or the lunar landings are fake, or there is an Intelligent Designer in the sky. They're entitled to their opinion, but they can't expect scientists to take them seriously.","challenge-both-sides","09:21 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","201"

"10-02-2007","10376",14,"chemist99a","285649","The philosophy of the school room in one generation will be the philosophy of the government in the next. ~ Abraham lincoln. This is not the case. In case you did not notice much of congress and the president himself are Christians and most of them are believers with respect to genesis. On the other hand the schools have taught purely material philosophies for those specific items for at least the last 60 years.","marc9000","286191","I almost forgot this one! (my sig) The ""philosophy of the government"" consists of a whole lot more than just the current president and congress. The government consists of its size, the amount of money it takes to run itself, established law, the courts, and the actions of the current president and congress. Today, many if not most Republican congressmen tax and spend more than many or most Democrats did back in the 1950's or 60's. They do that largely not because of their own philosophy, they do it because their constituents demand it. Schools have taught purely material philosophies for the last 40 years or so - prayer was banned in 63, the atheism that inspired didn't take a real good hold for several years after that. The voters from about 1970 on have more say in politics today than ever before. I heard on the news today that Hillary Clinton is easily raising more money than any other presidential candidate. She's a marxist, and if she doens't win she will come more dangerously close than any marxist in the past.","challenge-both-sides","08:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","205"

I'd suggest you do that, and think of a ""resolution"" that you'd like to prove, and how you'd like to word it. Think about details you'd like to establish, (word limits, time limits between posts etc.) Plan it out and post a challange in the ""challanges"" forum. You can name one poster you'd like to challange or allow anyone. Unfortunately, you are pretty new here, and we've had very bad luck with past newbies, be they participants or judges, when it comes to fulfilling their responsibilities. They started, then vacated the forums without finishing. You would have to convince the moderator(s) of your passion not to do that. Post your thought-out challange in the challanges forum, and a moderator or an opponent should respond, and take it from there. I'm not a moderator or a judge - no desire to be either - but could probably make a suggestion or two about who would make a good judge.","challenge-both-sides","08:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","208"

A big government would be more involved in the lives of citizens and affairs of business than would a small government in just about every case. Yes. And if schools teach that morals are not absolute (do not come from a higher source) those they represent are going to demand more immoral re-distribution of wealth. There is a reason most evolutionists are politically liberal. Today's philosophy of the school room and the U.S. founding documents are somewhat contradictory philosophies. I can name select teaching of history - select teaching of current events. Where did I use the word ""theology""? The word is ""philosophy"". The 1915 Declaration of Principles by that eras AAUP is a philosophy, largely being turned on its head today. The philosophy of the recent past school rooms of most voters today leads them to desire the philosophy of Hillary Clinton for president. Did you see this thread? As the election gets closer we may have to discuss that.","challenge-both-sides","09:15 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","210"
