Therefore, it is a statement of faith made by a believer in whatever his or her dogma is.","trebor","285354","So far, there is no evidence that ""Jesus Christ"" is not fictional. There are many reasons to consider the stories that talk about Jesus to have very many mythical elements, such as, divinity, being born of a virgin, resurrection, having dead people walk around when being executed, being a miracle worker, and little things like that which are internal evidence that Jesus Christ is fictional. The way that ""Jesus"" mirrors the cult of Augustus Caesar is , to me, strong evidence that ""Jesus Christ"" is fictional. So many of the stories about Jesus contradict our experiences of how the world works. You call those 'miracles'. I call them 'Evidence Jesus is Fictional'.","challenge-both-sides","06:47 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","61"
"09-26-2007","10376",5,"chemist99a","285126","Yes if everybody just agrees to ignore the facts then nobody can question the validity of genesis. On the other hand ignoring the facts is intellectually dishonest. You ask for both sides to be self-deceptive! Such a willing suspension of disbelief would be a self-destructive act. 4. a concept whose truth can be proved; ""scientific hypotheses are not facts""","marc9000","285358","You should acknowledge that there are different opinions on what a ""fact"" is. If we check dictionary.com, we find a pretty big array of descriptions of just what facts are, and some get very close to disagreeing with each other. We do find this statement there; I believe that's true, and I'm sure many scientists don't. So there you have it, who is right? Could it be that many scientists believe it's possible to add a fact and a theory, and come up with a fact for the sum of the two? Or might they think that multiple additions, such as five facts + one theory equals a fact? Or maybe one fact + one theory + one hypothesis + one guess + one lick + one promise all equal a fact as long as it supports atheism? Actual facts are pretty hard to come by IMO. They should be so clear that they shouldn't be disputed. I even believe it's possible to add two facts and not always get a fact for the sum. The slightest bit of human desire or emotion changes it from a fact to a theory. To not acknowledge that science does this for political reasons all the time could be a VERY self destructive act, considering its eternal consequences.","challenge-both-sides","07:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","62"

Even if you could (yes, that is a challenge), it wouldn't disprove that Jesus was God's son.","marc9000","285359","No, but it takes away the ~original sin~ part, the most important part of Christianity - the huge price Jesus paid for it, and subsequential sin. If that's made trivial, then Jesus life wasn't important.","challenge-both-sides","07:39 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","63"
"09-26-2007","10376",5,"unkerpaulie","285235","i totally agree. the problem is that facts and evidence have an annoying habit of existing and being true, and they are pretty difficult to ignore","marc9000","285360","It depends on what ones worldview is, and his/her definition of what a fact is.

""God does not exist"", and ""Sin is a fairy tale to scare people"", etc, etc, etc.","marc9000","285361","They (and much of the scientific community) do it because religion gets in the way of many things they want to do. They want to be involved in political decisions concerning scientific things. Loads of money and power hang in the balance.","challenge-both-sides","07:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","65"

Of course, even if you took Genesis seriously, there wouldn't be 'original sin' as the Christians proclaim it anyway.","challenge-both-sides","07:59 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","66"
"09-26-2007","10376",5,"feindslayer","285232","Ah, just wondering. Thx. Just a reminder: everyone, including Christians, sin. I am unfamiliar with Phelps, apparently for a good reason. I feel sorry for you. Only a 'jack spitter' wouldn't. I am surprised at your stalling, why not just inform me of this irony directly? Ya, have you ever heard of scientology? Now that is pretty ridiculous.","snakespit","285363","Well, perhaps you should do some reading. But now that I have given you one example of a christian preaching hate and bigotry, would you another example...or did that satisfy your requirements. Well, that's just your cross to bear. I don't feel sorry for myself in the least. But if you want to go on worrying about me...you go right ahead. Because the fact that you need it explained to you in the first place is the best part. As is the majority of organized religion. What's your point?","challenge-both-sides","08:23 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","67"

The Bible was used for more then 600 years as a historical literal, scientific book. But in less then 50 it went from accepted fact to a mere story book.

"09-27-2007","10376",5,"Vinterland","285343","Indeed he is as disbelief is still belief - he expresses the denial of God which is unique to strong atheists. Furthermore, he claims that Doctrine essential to Christianity is wrong. I've heard this all before...but where...oh, that's right, from Richard Dawkins! ""Big-Bang creationism"" would simply be creationism reconciled with the Big Bang, abiogenesis, and evolution. God, in all His creativity, setup the Big Bang and let the ball start rolling, so to speak. Who are you to and other strong-atheists to evangelize your beliefs to eveyone? ""God does not exist"", and ""Sin is a fairy tale to scare people"", etc, etc, etc.","Count Otto","285394","Where does Richard Dawkins say this? I'm currently re-reading The God Delusion, so I'll keep my eye out. Right. And how does this help us in any way? Do you also attribute a divine aspect to lightning and clouds?

No dear... evolution is a fact. there are many theories about how it happened. Of course theories aren't facts. But everything about science is a theory, except observable facts. Evolution is one of the many observable facts. We see it in operation. We have numerous theories of cosmology, a couple of theories of gravity, various theories of quantum mechanics, and a selection of theories about evolution of which Darwinian ones are only a subset. Science is about building theories, or models of the universe that are tested against the real universe. Religion is about blindly believing in scripture no matter how much at odds with reality it is. Only scientific perspectives offer reason. Religious ones are the absence of reason. You've obviously picked your bed to lie in, but don't expect the rest of us to marvel at your reasoning, because we can't find any there.","challenge-both-sides","09:28 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","75"
