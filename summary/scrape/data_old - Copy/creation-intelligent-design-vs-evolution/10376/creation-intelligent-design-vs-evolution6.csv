You think he cares about fluid mechanics? Of course not! Organisms sink due to complexity, not mass or size! Creationists ignore whatever they want and lie about everything else. Remember that creationists aren't Christians, they are Bibilists. The Bible is their God, not Jesus. They don't care if they are lying hacks who #### on every moral teaching of Christ. They must uphold the literal view of the their God. Hence why they deny evolution yet freely use products derived from its sciences.","challenge-both-sides","12:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","78"

"09-27-2007","10376",6,"marc9000","285359","No, but it takes away the ~original sin~ part, the most important part of Christianity - the huge price Jesus paid for it, and subsequential sin. If that's made trivial, then Jesus life wasn't important.","chemist99a","285464","OK but first of all you assume that Jesus was NOT fictional in the first place. He may well BE fictional. Seondly if Jesus was NOT fictional then our accounts of his life are likely to be fictional as opposed to factual. If Jesus is factual and he led the life of a political or cultural dissident at the time then his life probably had meaning for him. Whether his life (actually his death which may be fictional) has the meaning imputed to it by Christian doctrine may also be fictional. And lets assume the worst case. The whole construct is fictional. So what? How does that change anything. Granted the foundation of Christian doctrine is then fictional - but do you think that will alter the doctrine? Lets assume Jesus himself was real, but that the accounts of his death are fictional. That does not make his life meaningless. What is does is to remove the foundations of Christian doctrine regarding removal of sins by a Balder like demi-god. That only makes such doctrine based on a fiction. Won't be the first time. So the only thing that takes on the chin if Jesus was fictional is Christian Doctrine - and followers of that Doctrine will cling to it whether its fictional or not.","challenge-both-sides","12:43 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","80"
"09-27-2007","10376",6,"lesz","285416","Creationists and rational people share facts, but only rationalists are able to put them together in viable theory. RATIONALISM 1. the principle or habit of accepting reason as the supreme authority in matters of opinion, belief, or conduct. 2.Philosophy. a.the doctrine that reason alone is a source of knowledge and is independent of experience. b.(in the philosophies of Descartes, Spinoza, etc.) the doctrine that all knowledge is expressible in self-evident propositions or their consequences. 3.Theology. the doctrine that human reason, unaided by divine revelation, is an adequate or the sole guide to all attainable religious truth. No dear... evolution is a fact. there are many theories about how it happened. Of course theories aren't facts. But everything about science is a theory, except observable facts. Evolution is one of the many observable facts. We see it in operation. We have numerous theories of cosmology, a couple of theories of gravity, various theories of quantum mechanics, and a selection of theories about evolution of which Darwinian ones are only a subset. Science is about building theories, or models of the universe that are tested against the real universe. Religion is about blindly believing in scripture no matter how much at odds with reality it is. Only scientific perspectives offer reason. Religious ones are the absence of reason. You've obviously picked your bed to lie in, but don't expect the rest of us to marvel at your reasoning, because we can't find any there.","marc9000","285467","You're not chemist99a - it's always interesting how atheists are often quick to answer for each other, yet creationists, at least on these forums seldom if ever do. I honestly wonder if that's because creationists are so heavily outnumbered here, or if there are other reasons. It doesn't square with the way creationists are constantly accused of blindly following dogma, while atheists claim to be so open and reasonable. Those who are ""open"" should have more difficulty representing each other than those who are blindly following one thing, it would seem to me. Oh well. Lets look at what rationalists are. From dictionary.com; We see that rationalists consider reason to be independent of experience, and independent of divine revelation. Experience tells us how people of past generations reacted to changes in human activity, and divine revelation addresses a REALITY that science draws a blank on origins. By tossing those two things out, some rationalists seem to be able to put together a godless viable theory, and call it a fact. Its nice amusement for themselves, but its not reality. It would depend on what the definition of evolution is this week. No dear, our lives are too short for us to observe it. Science is increasingly about money and power, and opposing religion because it gets in the way. About blindly believing in theories and atheism no matter how much at odds with reality it is, including experience and origins questions. So science is the only source of knowledge? Learning from experience is not reasonable? Youre not going to, if you worship science. But there really are other sources of knowledge available to you.","challenge-both-sides","12:58 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","81"

So the only thing that takes on the chin if Jesus was fictional is Christian Doctrine - and followers of that Doctrine will cling to it whether its fictional or not. the foundation of christianity in its entirety rests on whether or not genesis is literally true. if it isnt, then god isnt as all powerful as christianity says he is, and man isnt born in sin and needs a savior like christianity says we are. if genesis is shown to be false, as every bit of evidence suggests it is, the christianity falls apart completely","marc9000","285471","Everyone's life has meaning for themselves. Christianity is about his life having a BIG meaning for everyone. If there is no original sin, and no importance in the cross, his sacrifice, his gift to all who accept it, his life can still have meaning to all in ways comparable to people like Americas founders, but not in the BIG way that the entire Bible teaches, and all organized western denominations claim. It will alter the political decisons we make today. We will be more likely to be terrified of global warming. We won't care as much about things like abortion and mercy killing. People today don't pay much attention to what....George Washington said or did. If accounts of Jesus' death are fictional, he would justify getting no more attention than Washington. One more thing will take it on the chin, traditional, conservative political desicions. Let's review, unkerpaulie said this; I agreed with it. Three posters have changed the subject, and gotten me into a largely unrelated discussion. No one has seriously taken issue with unkerpaulie, a non-Christian, for saying it. If any creationist says it, he is personally attacked by several other posters, most notable ""theistic evolutionists"". Why? I would like to see a discussion on it.","challenge-both-sides","01:32 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","84"

I could think of no geologist who think that oil is formed under such short time scales. Not to mention burial, trapping, inversion and migration. But then its all a conspiracy by the right wing petroleum barons to remove the bible from the classroom to distract the people who think it is the democrats removing the bible form the classrooms while the oil barons can start wars to get more oil to sell to the reptilians from alpha centuari 4 who are here on earth posing as humans and are in league with the jews who flew the planes intro the twin towers to blame the arabs for having all the oil in the first place.","challenge-both-sides","01:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","85"

Duh! Out-thought. Must be difficult for believers to realise that given logic and certain premises, only a few answers are possible. Believers are so blind they don't even realise they are blindly following. Atheists, on the other hand, have to work it our for themselves. The reason we sound alike is because all logical paths lead to Rome. Not Catholic Rome, either. Reason is certainly independent of divine revelation, because there is no such thing. Reason has to deal with experience, however. Divine revelation is not part of anyone's experence, however keen they may be to convince themselves it is. Sorry, but you have given us no reason to suppose your version of god is a reality. It's just your version. I suppose you can amuse yourself by making up your god, but you really need more than that to convince rational thinkers. I think you are mistaking science for religion. Idiotically believing in religion never got anyone anywhere. Science, on the other hand, does manage to accomplish things. Sweetie, science is about experience. Since you have no understanding of science, i am not surprised you couldn't figure it out. No dear, we don't worship science. We learn using it. You worship your bible, and that's a crock.","challenge-both-sides","02:56 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","89"
