There is a reason most evolutionists are politically liberal. Today's philosophy of the school room and the U.S. founding documents are somewhat contradictory philosophies.","lesz","286205","They aren't. Believe it or not, there actually are a few educated conservatives who know a hawk from a handsaw. Not all political conservatives are mindless religious fundamentalists by a long shot. Some of them actually do espouse rationality, even if they aren't always right. Not really. Both are secular, a concept religious extremists find hard to grasp.","challenge-both-sides","09:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","212"
"10-02-2007","10376",15,"chemist99a","286204","Ah but can you name any teaching that is NOT selective? Any, any at all? Bet you cannot! After all what would be the point? What would the teacher do if he were not selective?","lesz","286207","Ah, but public schools do not teach how wonderful and true Marc's god is, and how everyone who doesn't believe in Marc's god the way Marc does is going to hell. *shrug* Christian fundies, like Islamic ones, can't abide the thought that not everyone believes what they do, that their religion shouldn't be force-fed to those who don't share it, and that it's wrong to punish them for their heresy. That is why they are fundies. Marc should have learned a lesson from his drubbing at the hands of Peeling -- it doesn't work well to argue irrationally.","challenge-both-sides","09:34 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","214"
"10-03-2007","10376",15,"marc9000","286191","I heard on the news today that Hillary Clinton is easily raising more money than any other presidential candidate. She's a marxist, and if she doens't win she will come more dangerously close than any marxist in the past.","obvious_child","286243","This part is particularly funny. Marxism rejects capitalism and the class structure. Much of Hillary's fund raising panders to the elite classes of professionals while paying lip service to the middle and lower classes. Furthermore, she's calling in a number of corporation funding that her husband did during his runs. Hillary is one of the Democrats most beholden to corporations and the upper class. So how can she be a Marxists when she raises much of her capital from things Marxism rejects and tries to overthrow? There Marc9000 goes again making words up and hoping people don't remember what they actually mean. Hillary is a abomination, no question, but a Marxist she is not, to believe she is, is to completely fail to understand what Marx wrote.","challenge-both-sides","01:44 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","217"

The problem with absolutes, as you should have known after being crushed like a bug so many times relying on them, is that one exception refutes the argument. Killing a innocent child may be morally wrong under most conditions, but if killing that child saves 600 billion people in some extreme senario, it's not morally wrong as the lives of the 600 billion are more important then 1 innocent child.","challenge-both-sides","01:49 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","218"

"10-03-2007","10376",15,"Peeling","285996","It's funny, though - none of the 'moon landings were faked' sites actually have an image of that soft drink bottle. The claims are based on what a handful of people thought they saw for a split second on their 1950's tv sets - in fuzzy black and white. NASA no longer have a functional rocket capable of lunar insertion, so yes, they would have to start from scratch. And they would probably not be allowed to use the same technology, since health and safety was a little more... relaxed during the cold war. No, they show light shimmering off the few inches of aerial that juts out of the backpack. No glints anywhere higher up. And you can clearly see from the footage that the astronaut is not 'dangling' from his pack as would be mandated by such an arrangement. Oh really? You can clearly see the Milky Way on a night with a full moon? How about if the moon were ten times closer? Or you were stood on it? You know, if it were effectively daytime. Not in terms of dynamic range it hasn't. Ansel Adams managed to eke ten stops of detail out of black and white film using special processing techniques. That's a contrast ratio of around 1024-1. But to get the full moon exposed as anything other than a pure white disc and still pick up Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, you would need a dynamic range of over 10,000-1. If perspective is what it was all about, why are you talking about something completely different? Perspective is why shadows that are in fact parallel appear to converge as they recede from the viewer. Some 'fake' sites claim multiple lights were used. For heaven's sake, why would they do that? ""Hey, guys, I know we're trying to fake the moon landing and all but I'm really not happy with the lighting I'm getting here; could you rig up a few more spots?"" Any hypothesis that requires thousands of ordinary people to be masterfully cunning and tight-lipped conspirators and thundering XXXXXX should be setting off alarm bells all over your head. Indeed, the fact it doesn't speaks volumes for how you look at the world. The fake lunar landing 'conspiracy'; the great atheist 'conspiracy'. Everywhere you look, people are conspiring against you, out to fool you, make you look stupid, attack your beliefs, and you're ready and willing to swallow anything , no matter how ridiculous or poorly thought out, so long as it panders to that paranoia. I would not like to live in the world you inhabit, marc.","marc9000","286455","My memory is fuzzy on that - seems like it was on the tapes I referred to. After a quick google search, I think the names of those who produced the tapes were David Percy and James Collier. Seems to me the bottle was in a zoomed in freeze frame. And the tv sets weren't 50's - the Apollo space flights were in the late 60's / early 70's. And I know that it was After Feb. 2002 when I watched the tapes. Don't know just when Percy and Collier made them however. There was a lot more to it than ""lunar insertion"". There was breaking free from earths gravity, life support for the entire trip, a lunar orbiter capable of human support, the list would be long. Mountains of plans, drawings specifications, details. The news article I saw claimed everything was completely gone. The shimmering light I saw went several feet in the air as I recall. The one thing that really stands out in my mind is how one of them was helping another one up as he was squatting down doing something, and all of a sudden he jumped up like a jack in the box!! Like someone jerked on his wires a little to hard. I realize Percy and Collier could have sped their tape up. Not much question one side or the other was faking it. The reaction I got by bringing it up here surprised me however, blind faith in science may be more intense than I thought. I may start a new thread on this, not so much for an argument over pictures or what Percy and Collier started, but just some review of it after 38 years. The phrase was ""one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind"". It seems to me after 38 years we would see some evidence of that giant leap. What would that evidence be? That we threw away ALL the documentation of it and forgot it all? I can see plenty of stars, in....75 % of the sky where the moon isn't. Something else I'd like to get into with some posters here - have you ever ""scaled down"" the universe, to try to get some kind of a handle on just how far away one light year, or one hundred thousand light years is? Making the earth one inch in diameter for example, and reducing everything else accordingly? Pretty amazing what science tells us they can see. I did some of it long ago, if I remember right with the earth one inch, the sun is 900+ feet away, about 9 feet in diameter. I can buy that, but the Milky Way galaxie 100,000 light years across? Is there ever a point in space where science says it doesn't know? It has several meanings, I was referring to the way shadows oppose one point of light in a direction opposite from that light. If the light is close, they won't be parallel. If the light is 93 million miles away, they should be perfectly parallel. You actually meant ""For Darwin's sake"" right? Just a typo? Because no matter how big the movie studio is, you can't easily fake ONE light that's 93 million miles away with one light that's much closer. I'll finish if for you. ""We're trying to do a sun 93 million miles away, just that one big light way over at that wall aint gettin it done. It's going to take multiple lights to do the trick. Maybe I'm being picky, the science worshiping public probably won't notice a few messed up shadows, but we gotta do the best we can. We got it made though, the big bucks will be rolling in soon after we get this done and throw all the drawings away. Toss me a coke!! It's happening in the global warming farce right now! It's a thing called MONEY, my friend. It's not just me, there's more going on in the U.S. than how it's represented at 4forums. I don't know how old you are - I grew up in the 1960's and I know there were problems. But we weren't being overrun with Mexicans, we didn't have an internet saturated with porn, we didn't have busy bridges falling down with trucks and cars on them, we didn't have random drug testing in so many occupations, and we didn't have most of the public (and the government) drowning in debt. Who's more paranoid, myself or obvious_child? I can't help but wonder if, while he's riding his tricycle on the sidewalk, he doesn't see a church and go into a major rage. I wonder if he's ever vandalized a church building. There is a culture war going on in Western civilization if you haven't noticed. You're mistaking what you see as ""paranoia"" for an interest in it, a desire to discuss it, and my belief that one notable domestic wrong turn may have as much to do with our survival, or failure to survive, as a wrong turn in the war on terrorism.","challenge-both-sides","09:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","220"

"10-03-2007","10376",15,"obvious_child","286147","Actually no you can't. Marc9000 claimed the same thing. He pulverized beyond subatomic level with Peeling. We reply faster because we know what we're talking about, unlike you and we're not burdened by living a lie. To accept literal genesis is to believe that God is a deceitful liar.","feindslayer","286457","Actually, ya I did. Ha. I know what I'm talking about. But you must remember that this site has approx. 4 times more evos than creos.I posted my challenge so that I would be able to convert you all one at a time, rather than having to crush you all at the same time. It's easier, but it takes longer. To believe Genesis is to believe God 's word. You are a bit mixed up.","challenge-both-sides","09:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","222"
"10-03-2007","10376",15,"obvious_child","286182","What makes you think that you could do this when you can't do it in the regular forums just responding to ONE person?","feindslayer","286458","Well, for starters, it's a lot easier to respond to one person at a time. It the time it took me to completely counter the first two pages of evo argument, you all had completed yet another four pages (I have a life outside of debating). Also, have you ever heard the song 'One'? If I am debating only one evo at a time, there are no other interfering evos that cause distraction.","challenge-both-sides","10:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","223"
