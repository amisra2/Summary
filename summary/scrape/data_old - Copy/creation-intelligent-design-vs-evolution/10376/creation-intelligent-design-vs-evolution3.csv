"09-24-2007","10376",3,"chemist99a","285116","Some gems from the slayer of fiends {whatever they are}. Nope. The creo vs evo debate is mostly about pre-christian myths of sheepherders. Old testament claims not NT at all. Don't worry FS many people deny that they need a savior without self-deception. Indeed its often due to self discovery. Nope, the persons who claim to speak for GOD want their beliefs validated on the basis of faith. GOD does not put in a personal appearance because he/it is a creation of men and a fictional one at that. Now just what is it you think I need to be ""saved"" from?","feindslayer","285127","That is only half. The only thing that separates Christianity from Judaism (both creationism religions) is Jesus. You need to give evidence against both the books of the Old Testament as well as the New Testament. Self-discovery is okay as long as you are saved from your sin. If God were to come down in all of his glory right now, you'd be 'like the chaff that the wind drives away'. You, obviously, need to be saved from your sin. We all do. Accept Jesus into your heart ASAP. You don't need to read the Bible or even go to Church, just spread the Good News about Him. It's 'feinds', not fiends. Jeeze.","challenge-both-sides","11:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","43"
