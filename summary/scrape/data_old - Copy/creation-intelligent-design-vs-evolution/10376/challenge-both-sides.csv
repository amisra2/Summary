In other words if the theory PREDICTS the X should be the case given all the Y circumstances and one sets up the Ys and does not observe outcomes consistent with the predicted X, AND the experiment withstands the tests of method and logic THEN one has to question (perhaps falsiify) the theory. Especially if the experimental work is repeatable and consistent. [/QUOTE] Evolution has not been falsified as of yet. Creationism has been - If nothing else the claim made of 6000 years to get from an empty earth to our current state is as faslified as its possible to get considering the multitude of counterexamples. And there are an extremely large number of lines of evidence which falsify the concept of ""kinds"", the idea that what we call complexity has not increased, the idea that an intelligent designer must be invoked to cause what we observe, the idea that intelligence is required to evolve species, and the concept that random mutation (and other effectively random but heritable variation mechanisms) combined with the crucible of natural selection CANNOT suffice to produce species from existing organisms and linages.

As it is, demands that science ""disprove"" their claims are about as bright as demands that science ""disprove"" claims that there are old, bearded, white guys sitting on thrones in heaven, creating things. Or ""disprove"" there are purple unicorns on Pluto. Creationists should try make claims science can disprove, then we can take them more seriously as participants in a scientific discussion. As it is, evolution makes plenty of potentially disprovable claims... the problem for Creationists is that every time they are tested, they pass the tests. So Creationists ignore them. There is absolutely no evidence any Creationist would accept for the theory of evolution, and no evidence any Creationist would accept against the biblical account. They aren't doing science, and they don't care about disproofs; they are merely practicing religion.","challenge-both-sides","12:36 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","15"
"09-21-2007","10376",2,"unkerpaulie","284784","sup trebor, long time no see the literalist's 6 day creation is challenged by the evidence which supports a much older earth with signs of life much older than 6000 years, such as fossils and limestone deposits left behind by living creatures that date back into thousands and even millions of years. there is no literal creationist that can answer the question: ""so when did dinosaurs exist?"" they do a good job of disproving their own belief the ""god made the big bang"" belief is challenged by occam's razor. just because something hasnt been scientifically proven yet doesnt mean that god did it. the trend of the ""god did it"" belief is that is diminishes everytime a scientific discovery os made. for instance, for a period noone knew what caused natuarl disasters to destroy people and property. the original default explantation was ""god is angry, so he did it"". today we know how these phenomena occur, so ""god did it"" is no longer a suitable response. the same for why a year's harvest might be good, or why there's an eclipse in the middle of the day, or why a child might be born deformed. the ""god did it"" patch is always removed when scientific and rational explanations are found. as for the big bang, its one of the few phenomena that rational thinking hasn't totally covered, and is therefore one of the few cards the creationists can hold on to for the time being. its doesnt disprove this creationist idea, but it forms a strong case for why it will soon be abandoned","trebor","284826","Occam's razor is a generality, and 'might' hold the answer, if we knew enough. It also is often misapplied. IT says 'things are no more complicated than they need to be'. It can be argued (not by me), that God is needed. OF course, the 6-12k creation is blown out of the water. That is due to the pure raw data. When it comes to the 'god did it' on the big bang, that starts going into 'metaphysical' proofs. While there is no evidence FOR a God, there is only word games people can play to be either for or against a god.

Science is about building theories, or models of the universe that are tested against the real universe. Religion is about blindly believing in scripture no matter how much at odds with reality it is. Only scientific perspectives offer reason. Religious ones are the absence of reason.

Seondly if Jesus was NOT fictional then our accounts of his life are likely to be fictional as opposed to factual. If Jesus is factual and he led the life of a political or cultural dissident at the time then his life probably had meaning for him . Whether his life (actually his death which may be fictional) has the meaning imputed to it by Christian doctrine may also be fictional. And lets assume the worst case. The whole construct is fictional. So what? How does that change anything. Granted the foundation of Christian doctrine is then fictional - but do you think that will alter the doctrine? Lets assume Jesus himself was real, but that the accounts of his death are fictional. That does not make his life meaningless. What is does is to remove the foundations of Christian doctrine regarding removal of sins by a Balder like demi-god. That only makes such doctrine based on a fiction. Won't be the first time. So the only thing that takes on the chin if Jesus was fictional is Christian Doctrine - and followers of that Doctrine will cling to it whether its fictional or not. the foundation of christianity in its entirety rests on whether or not genesis is literally true. if it isnt, then god isnt as all powerful as christianity says he is, and man isnt born in sin and needs a savior like christianity says we are. if genesis is shown to be false, as every bit of evidence suggests it is, the christianity falls apart completely","marc9000","285471","Everyone's life has meaning for themselves.

I remember a 19 against 1 creationist thread here a few months ago. The 19 didn't seem to exactly be having a lot of fun, with all the 4 letter words and declarations of putting the one creationist on ignore. It is a major difference. And they never seem to debate each other. Actual scientists like Richard Dawkins? His books are best sellers - books that attempt to use evolution to disprove God. If you equate our knowledge of WW2 with our knowledge of what happened billions of years ago that's your business. If you see mountains and tell me that you see 250 million years of age with no faith involved, okay. I guarantee the fun I have with this rivals the fun you have with creationists. Sources? So the Declaration was rhetorical flourish? Has this been recently discovered by evolution? That wasn't a question to you personally, or anyone personally. It was directed in general about science, to another poster. More of those products of evolutionary thought? That's a big ""except""!! Evolutionists can tell us all about those genetics and biochemical things that explain the ""disease"" of religion and what can be done about it can't they? Dawkins has done it - I'm sure there are others. Science is making itself an authority on how insignificant God is. The more they theorize about evolution, the less important God becomes. God is in their way! Non-scientists are just faithful sheep, aren't they? If only the U.S. founders were alive today, only scientists would be allowed to vote or hold office. If we can get rid of creationists, maybe we can get this changed. All scientists will someday be in agreement on global warming? How long do you think that will be?

You cannot shake a true believer with a few facts or even with well founded theories. And if its due to hormones - well creationists believe thats the design and they know who to complain to. All the atheists I know do not believe that their persons survive their own deaths. Eternal consequences there may be (who can predict the effects of ones actions even a 1000 years in the future), but the athesists I know do not anticipate that those consequences will impact them. Sure they are. Human beings are stubborn entities and many of us will fight to defend our beliefs even when facts to the contrary begin to accumulate. All the atheists I know are human. Us scientist agnostics are as bad about that as any others, but we are trained to give our beliefs up when the evidence runs to much against our ideas.

And of course since I grew up in the Bible Belt and have now retired back to the same region, I am surrounded by Christians and have ample opportunity to observe their behaviors and discuss their beliefs. Thats very true. Atheism is much much older than evolution as is not founded on Darwin or his successors. Its founded on empirical evidence and logic, however it is a BELIEF and is not subject to either proof or disproof. Science itself is agnostic. It makes no affirmations of either theology or its complement (atheism). My personal belief is that atheism is valid. My scientific work is strictly agnostic and does not invoke GOD or the non-existense of GOD. Panic? Do you think that if evolution vanished tomorrow as a viable theory that atheism would be impacted? How so? Atheism has a lot more going for it than Science (which in fact does not support either Atheism or Theism) or evolution (which is also agnostic not atheistic). Biologists would not discard evolution unless and until a more satisfactory theory was worked out. Noble prizes would be awarded, PhDs would be earned, new knowledge would be gained and good time would be had by all. Certainly not panic.

Are those senses and your reason the way you survive and deal sucessfuly with the world around you? Is the idea of a GOD necessary to explain the world, or is it more likely that you do not know it all yet but can learn over time? Logic and reason are very old human capabilities. We invented ""GOD"" in the same way that engineers invented Murphy! As a placeholder for things about which we are ignorant at a given point in time.

"09-29-2007","10376",10,"chemist99a","285642","Well lets ask this. Would you have scientists determine what is and is not GOD? The community of practitioners of a field so far as I know are always the people who define what that field is and how its practiced. Lawyers define what the practice of law IS, physicians, plumbers, gardners, and a host of others. WHO else would be sufficiently acquainted with a field than the practitioners???????? And provided that the genetic and biochemical mechanisms which might lead to religion are accessible to empirical experimentation and investigation they are fair game for science and scientists. Any material process which is accessible is grist for the mill of science. Would you somehow restrict the scope of scientific investigation to avoid any possible study of such things? On what basis might I ask? That man was not meant to know? Well if we were not meant to know, then presumably any such studies would fail. No harm in giving it a go is there? Sure they do and they have done exactly that. But so far as empirical science their efforts are a bust. Of course that could change tomorrow and when they publish some evidence which actually is scientifically supportive of their hypothesis then I will be glad to study their materials, methods, and conclusions. As to not being religious - well the major proponents have all indicated that they consider the ""intelligent designer"" to be their personally concieved GOD. Given that they are religious and ID is religious. And the courts have after reviewing the relationships and connections declared ID to be religious. On the other hand they have as much right as anyone else to carry out their own empirical investigations and compete in the universe of competing ideas. I do not think they will achieve much , but they are free to compete. Oh yes - we all define ourselves please note! Its obvious that any enterprise performed by humans will not be unbiased. Scientific conclusions are necessarily biased and non-neutral. For example a physics PhD would not be neutral if asked whether weight was the determinant of how long it takes an object to fall to the ground from the top of a tower. He will likely tell you that objects as diverse as a grape and a lead ball will hit the ground at about the same time even though the two objects have very different weights. That of course is discriminatory against the theories which hold otherwise, but it cannot be helped. How could that scientist be neutral in a society which holds as a general rule that the heavier object falls fastest? He cannot if he wishes to maintain his scientific integrity.","marc9000","285727","They are politically attempting to determine what is not God at the present. No they're not, they're called ID and they're blocked by the courts, from public funding and from public education. Separation of church and state. So that atheism and state can continue their loving relationship. ANY material process would include evidence of design. Not the identity of the designer, just evidence of design. When a large part of the material process is evidence against design, for social and political gain, there is a double standard. There has also been a major bust in evolution. The recent discoveries of the complexities of the simplest forms of life. Darwin knew nothing about them. Chances of them arising by chance decreases exponentially. A William Dembski analogy shows it very well. I don't remember what he was applying it to, but I've posted it at these forums before, don't remember exactly where. I remember the basics. A combination lock with a left-right-left combination and a 1 to 39 numbered dial has a one in 64,000 probability of being opened by chance. (40x40x40) That could be the equivalent of mice spontaniously generating from dirty hay, as was believed by some in Darwins day. A somewhat more complicated combination would be turned in 5 directions, left-right-left-right-left, with a 1 to 99 numbered dial. When we multiply 100x100x100x100x100, we don't get 64,000 any more, we get 10 BILLION. It's a good analogy - it shows that what Darwin believed happened by chance and what todays atheists believe happened by chance are not even remotely comparable. What is the difference between proponents of ID admitting they are religious, as opposed to most biologists today who admit they are atheist? Why is one trusted and the other not? A double standard. Without public money and future generations minds, I'm sure you're right about what they'll achieve. If they achieve something, heavily funded atheist attack dogs combined with indoctrination of students in schools should void it out very well. Apples and oranges.

If one knew there is no need to spend the time and effort involved in doing the science. No ""good"" rationalist would reply ""Sure I know the answer to that"" when he does not. The technical term is telling a lie. In summary Science and scientists cannot do science and remain neutral on matters of social and political debate.

He watches children grow, goes to more funerals. Friendships, daily activities, priorities, they all can change. King Solomon, who wrote the book of Proverbs, was a very wise man. I believe older people have an easier time understanding what he wrote than do younger people. It can be compared . Nothing we see through a telescope comes close to matching the complexity of.....computers. Or something much more complex than computers - the human body. I think so. What do we see but dead rocks and energy through our telescopes? There's nothing out there complex enough to come here and say hello to us. It's real easy to believe we should have invaded Iraq. I'm glad Saddam Hussein is dead. If only we'd invaded Germany in 1940, millions of people wouldn't have been killed. I'm just trying to show an evolutionist the difference between the fast reality we can obviously see, vs. the billions of years ideology of evolution that we can't see. Logic tells me they don't both happen in the same natural environment. I plead guilty as charged - I don't have the imagination of an atheist. Well okay that's fine. As you get older, doesn't it get a little more perplexing when trying to describe how ""smart"" someone is? Very smart people are Christians - very simple people are Christians. Very smart people are atheists - very simple people are atheists. Some very simple people lead long, happy, productive lives, while some very smart people OD on recreational drugs in their twenties, or go bankrupt and kill themselves. The Bible relates to these things, does evolution? If we would utilize Biblical principes with all the communications capabilities that we have, with the labor saving devices we have, the toys many of us have to play with, we could all work one day a week and live like Kings. Increasing laziness and a decrease in human decency outlined in the Bible keep us working more hours than ever. (the ever shrinking number of us not on the public dole, that is) You're not making good comparisons. It would be better to compare Romans citizens attitudes during its buildup, its glory days, to its citizens attitudes shortly before its fall. Another good comparison would be morals and attitude in the U.S. 100 years ago vs its morals and attitudes today. Or its moral attitudes in the 60s compared to today. I was alive in the 60s.

Somebody told me to watch a VHS tape that proved it false, that analyzed the documentation of those moon trips, with todays technology and a critical eye. My mind was made up not to believe it as I started watching, but when it was done I knew - it was all a scientific con game. When science has the money, it can make us believe anything it wants. I must admit, even in 1969 I was wondering why the spacemen weren't jumping 25 feet off the ground there, since gravity was supposed to be 1/6 of the earths. They would jump about 3 feet, hang there a little, (slowed down tape) and settle back down. The tape showed no star canopy from the moon. (can't see stars when there's no air, according to NASA) Also can't reproduce a perfect star canopy on a movie set, can we NASA? The shadows were a big part of the analogy. They couldn't reproduce one light source with the distance away as the sun. The shadows clearly showed it. Lost a lot of my faith in science that day.

"10-01-2007","10376",12,"chemist99a","285752","Please be specific as to what discoveries about what species you are referring to. I can hardly evaluate a nonspecific argument like you attempted there. The microscopes of the 18th and 19th centuries showed that the growth was very small, apparantly living cells. So it seemed reasonable that simple living organisms could arise spontaneously from liquids. The key to persuading people was the portrayal of cells being simple. One of the chief advocates of the theory of spontaneous generation during the middle of the 19th century was Ernst Haeckel, a great admirer of Dawkins and an eager popularizer of Darwin theory. From the limited view of cells that microscopes provided, Haeckel believed that the cell was a ""simple lump of albuminous combination of carbon"", not much different from a piece of microscopic jello. So it seemed to Haeckel that such simple life, with no internal organs, could be produced easily from inanimate material. Now of course, we know better. Yes one would think that the probability of a complex lifeform arising by chance would be smaller than the probability of a simpler lifeform arising by chance. But as I recall Dumbskis analysis the rate of probability change is factorial rather than exponential. Well I can help you since I have read Dembskis stuff. His analysis does not hold up because the individual steps in the evolutionary process are NOT independent events. Nor does he consider the mutliple paths to a functional protein (organ, appendage etc) which exist in nature. Frankly his probability analysis is a joke among professionals in statistics and probability and his analyis (an argument from improbability) is both flawed mathematically and philosophically. I have refuted Dr D previously in considerable depth. I won't get into it here its just too long. Among other things he ignores the fact that probability analyses are not applicable after the improbable event has in fact occurred. Its a long argument not suitable for a quick explanation. But basically Dr D is wrong.","marc9000","285965","You're a chemist and you have to ask me that? Okay, I'll try to present it in laymans terms so that you can understand. Up until the 1950's, the 'light' microscope could only reach down to one tenth the size of a bacterial cell. In the 50's, the new 'electron' microscope could magnify an object 500,000 times. Many new subcellular structures were discovered! The simple cell suddenly became immensely complicated. Here's an outline of it from Behe; link To keep it basic, I could have been referring to the bacterial flagellum, and the most recent discoveries of DNA. Do you think it violates separation of church and state to require students in public science classes to read ""Darwins Black Box"", while no violation happens when students are required to read ""The Blind Watchmaker""? Please try not to go only by Dembski. Go by your own knowledge of cells, as opposed to the complete lack of knowledge of them by Darwin and all his helpers. Can you put your atheism aside for just a moment? No, you can't. Neither can any scientist. We're imperfect humans. If they're not independent, if they have to work together and be in order, wouldn't they be even more improbable? How about Dawkins probability analysis in his conclusions? Are they not equal ""jokes"" since you're always telling me that science is always saying ""I don't know""? Is Dr. Dawkins equally wrong? Or do ""jokes"" generally arise from worldviews, and the source of paychecks? An ""argument from improbability"" is actually a very logical argument. Sometimes I wonder if all these ""collegiate fallacy lists"" weren't inspired by a desperate attempt to establish the ""argument from improbability"" as something to be quickly disregarded, to protect evolution from question, as more and more complexity in biology is discovered.","challenge-both-sides","07:30 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","176"

The claims are based on what a handful of people thought they saw for a split second on their 1950's tv sets - in fuzzy black and white. NASA no longer have a functional rocket capable of lunar insertion, so yes, they would have to start from scratch. And they would probably not be allowed to use the same technology, since health and safety was a little more... relaxed during the cold war. No, they show light shimmering off the few inches of aerial that juts out of the backpack. No glints anywhere higher up. And you can clearly see from the footage that the astronaut is not 'dangling' from his pack as would be mandated by such an arrangement. Oh really? You can clearly see the Milky Way on a night with a full moon? How about if the moon were ten times closer? Or you were stood on it? You know, if it were effectively daytime. Not in terms of dynamic range it hasn't. Ansel Adams managed to eke ten stops of detail out of black and white film using special processing techniques. That's a contrast ratio of around 1024-1. But to get the full moon exposed as anything other than a pure white disc and still pick up Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, you would need a dynamic range of over 10,000-1. If perspective is what it was all about, why are you talking about something completely different? Perspective is why shadows that are in fact parallel appear to converge as they recede from the viewer. Some 'fake' sites claim multiple lights were used. For heaven's sake, why would they do that? ""Hey, guys, I know we're trying to fake the moon landing and all but I'm really not happy with the lighting I'm getting here; could you rig up a few more spots?""

The claims are based on what a handful of people thought they saw for a split second on their 1950's tv sets - in fuzzy black and white. NASA no longer have a functional rocket capable of lunar insertion, so yes, they would have to start from scratch. And they would probably not be allowed to use the same technology, since health and safety was a little more... relaxed during the cold war. No, they show light shimmering off the few inches of aerial that juts out of the backpack. No glints anywhere higher up. And you can clearly see from the footage that the astronaut is not 'dangling' from his pack as would be mandated by such an arrangement. Oh really? You can clearly see the Milky Way on a night with a full moon? How about if the moon were ten times closer? Or you were stood on it? You know, if it were effectively daytime. Not in terms of dynamic range it hasn't. Ansel Adams managed to eke ten stops of detail out of black and white film using special processing techniques. That's a contrast ratio of around 1024-1.

After a quick google search, I think the names of those who produced the tapes were David Percy and James Collier. Seems to me the bottle was in a zoomed in freeze frame. And the tv sets weren't 50's - the Apollo space flights were in the late 60's / early 70's. And I know that it was After Feb. 2002 when I watched the tapes. Don't know just when Percy and Collier made them however. There was a lot more to it than ""lunar insertion"". There was breaking free from earths gravity, life support for the entire trip, a lunar orbiter capable of human support, the list would be long. Mountains of plans, drawings specifications, details. The news article I saw claimed everything was completely gone. The shimmering light I saw went several feet in the air as I recall. The one thing that really stands out in my mind is how one of them was helping another one up as he was squatting down doing something, and all of a sudden he jumped up like a jack in the box!! Like someone jerked on his wires a little to hard. I realize Percy and Collier could have sped their tape up. Not much question one side or the other was faking it. The reaction I got by bringing it up here surprised me however, blind faith in science may be more intense than I thought. I may start a new thread on this, not so much for an argument over pictures or what Percy and Collier started, but just some review of it after 38 years. The phrase was ""one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind"". It seems to me after 38 years we would see some evidence of that giant leap. What would that evidence be? That we threw away ALL the documentation of it and forgot it all? I can see plenty of stars, in....75 % of the sky where the moon isn't. Something else I'd like to get into with some posters here - have you ever ""scaled down"" the universe, to try to get some kind of a handle on just how far away one light year, or one hundred thousand light years is? Making the earth one inch in diameter for example, and reducing everything else accordingly? Pretty amazing what science tells us they can see. I did some of it long ago, if I remember right with the earth one inch, the sun is 900+ feet away, about 9 feet in diameter. I can buy that, but the Milky Way galaxie 100,000 light years across? Is there ever a point in space where science says it doesn't know? It has several meanings, I was referring to the way shadows oppose one point of light in a direction opposite from that light. If the light is close, they won't be parallel. If the light is 93 million miles away, they should be perfectly parallel. You actually meant ""For Darwin's sake"" right? Just a typo? Because no matter how big the movie studio is, you can't easily fake ONE light that's 93 million miles away with one light that's much closer. I'll finish if for you. ""We're trying to do a sun 93 million miles away, just that one big light way over at that wall aint gettin it done. It's going to take multiple lights to do the trick. Maybe I'm being picky, the science worshiping public probably won't notice a few messed up shadows, but we gotta do the best we can. We got it made though, the big bucks will be rolling in soon after we get this done and throw all the drawings away. Toss me a coke!! It's happening in the global warming farce right now! It's a thing called MONEY, my friend. It's not just me, there's more going on in the U.S. than how it's represented at 4forums.

Who's more paranoid, myself or obvious_child? I can't help but wonder if, while he's riding his tricycle on the sidewalk, he doesn't see a church and go into a major rage.
