After all if the evidence indicates a very ancient earth then thats just a temptation to test ones faith is it not? Nope, I do not convert nor am I convertable. Conversion is not my thing if people hold mistaken ideas thats their problem. I might argue with them but its no foul if they disagree. Nope he produced the first credible scientific description of a process which could lead to the observed diversity of living organisms. Previously the ideas all invoked intelligence, or non-material causes. Just as organic chemistry did until Wohler. And of course to be sceintific only material causes can be invoked in a scientific theory. And once more with feeling - ATHEISM preceded Darwin and indeed preceded western science by centuries and centuries. Darwin did not invent it, Darwin did not advocate it. Darwin set out to explain how species might evolve a biological problem rather than a problem in theology or subjective belief. Sorry but science is agnostic no matter what forum it finds itself in. Its the nature of the beast. You think it atheistic simply because its not supportive of your beliefs in GOD. I have met others who think science is theistic because it does not claim to falsify the existense of GOD. Truth is that science when asked about GOD has to say ""I don't know"" which is the default hypothesis. To answer otherwise as a scientist is not logical. Dawkins is operating outside the limits of science if and when he claims to be able to state that GOD does not exist. At best he could answer that he does not (as a scientist) know. He like everyone else is perfectly free to express his personal belief. I for example personally believe that atheisim is valid, but I do not state that within a scientific contest - its a personal belief. What a chuckle. Atheism is a belief not an organization like say a megachurch which preaches against any rational belief which conflicts with the operators personal preferences. And often the ACLU defends Annon-scientific conflicts - the ACLU is interested in civil liberties and law neither one of which are scientific in nature. As to the American Atheists website - well probably not such a thing is easily funded out of small change these days. As to the ""Academic Bill or Rights"" do you have a copy of that document somewhere? And why do you think it should be established anywhere at all? Billions of dollars change hands every day big deal. And if you think that there never being any satisfactory theories is a good idea then you are the enemy of the human enterprise. And if you intend to enforce unsatisfactory theories such as creationism through the courts - well you might do it, but you will eventually be most unhappy with the outcome. First of all you have to have such evidence and then it has to be evaluated carefully. So far as I can see no credible evidence supporting a 6000 year old earth has yet emerged nor has credible evidence which would falsify the current hypothesis. But yes you are correct if the earth is only 6000 years old then Darwinian evolution would be down the tubes. Now show that the earth is only 6000 years old and ya got it made. An ancient earth is necessary. An earth which does not change for billions of years is NOT necessary, environmental variation is important to evolution in fact. As to mathematically impossible - well if you play the lottery for a billion years something is likely to turn up in your favor! And scientists do not fear a young earth, they just have confidence that its a failed hypothesis and that the current estimates are the best fit to the available observations. If you have credible new data to the contrary then put it on the table. You could change the world and win fame and fortune after all.","marc9000","285638","Yes, its a case of man thinking himself more capable than he is. If he's the highest possible form of intelligence, as atheism believes, then it makes sense that atheists are going to believe man to be more capable of something than a Christian would. Isn't it possible, with radiometric dating, that the rocks and the various other material geologists date are very old, while existing long before the earth actually settled into its orbit around the sun? (or was placed there by God) Couldn't a young earth, in its present form, be made up of much older material? Or is this something else that will never be studied, because temperatures and water similar to today would have had to exist for billions of years for evolution to work? A very old earth, young in its relationship with the sun , would very much destroy evolution. Well that's the way I am too, at least we can agree on that. Then for centuries and centuries, what did atheists do to support their beliefs with nothing but intelligence or non material causes? An ""I-don't-know but-we'll-find-it-someday"" attitude? Waiting for someone like Darwin, waving money around? ""Did not advocate it""? An outline of his life shows he did. He was bitter about the loss of his daughter. He wanted to make God go away. You said this in post #99; "" Science is not an authority on faith except in respect to possible genetic and biochemical mechanisms which might give rise to it."" Now lets pull something else of yours up from below, in this post, when I asked who should define science; ""Practioners of the noble art and craft of doing science - who else?"" So it's okay for those who practice science to determine whether or not it is science for them to study genetic and biochemical mechanisms that cause faith in someones brain? They can do that, because science is what they do, and they can define it that way? NOW, founders and students of Intelligent Design are practioners of the noble art and craft of searching for EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE OF DESIGN IN NATURE. Those practioners declare that art and craft is not religious, but they aren't allowed to do that! The practioners of science inform them that they ARE RELIGIOUS! The practioners of ID do not get to define themselves! Resolved; Science is NOT neutral, socially or in politics. Would you like to take the negative in a formal debate? When you claim science says ""I don't know"" you're not being a very good rationalist. You're disregarding FACTS. I'd like to show them to you in a structured debate. You'd be taking a politically correct negative - you can do it!! But I'll make my points. We'll discuss Dawkins in the formal debate. We'll discuss finances in the formal debate. The Academic Bill of Rights discussion has been going on, though not many here have had much to say on it. http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=10187 What theory deemed ""satisfactory"" vs. ""unsatisfactory"" should not be determined by one special interest, in a free society. The Discovery Institute has a chance of doing just that. But the resourses of time and money of their enemies is quite a challange for them to overcome. It is not hard to tell the difference between an honest shakedown vs. an unleashing of attack dogs. NASA isn't worried about moon landing evaluations either. No one can match their war chest. The astronauts have all slipped into oblivion, haven't they? I don't know if those who made that tape I watched are still alive or not, but I'm sure they stopped sleeping with their windows open. They were Europeans if I remember right, that may have helped save their lives.","challenge-both-sides","10:52 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","123"

That kind of conspiracy theory calls to cranks, and the best thing to do with cranks is to ignore them. One might as well . Creationists choose to be ignorant. The only way of educating them is to persuade them to make different choices, and that rarely works.","challenge-both-sides","03:48 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","133"

Hence you only see creationists really win arguments when their audience is either uneducated, or just stupid. I used to go to www.evcforum.net where there are a number of practicing chemists, geologists, and biologists as well as I think one or two phd physicists. Creationists there are regularly crushed like the French in WWII. Our dear troll super refuses to go there after getting a look. But the majority of the population isn't that smart or educated. Hence I think that is why Chemist does what he does: to prevent Super from misleading people. Bush pulled a hoodwink about abstinence only education, and it has been conclusively proven to lead to higher rates of unprotected sexual activity at lower ages. There are people out there who still believe it works! Imagine that. We must stand against those who would intentionally mislead. Not just that, creationists choose to live a lie. They reject the science of evolution yet freely use the products of sciences that all say evolution is true. How can evolution be false when all of the sciences that make up evolution bring you viable products using much of the same science? It doesn't, but creationism is nothing more then a lifestyle of lies. They are not Christians remember, they are Bibilists. The teaching of Christ, the moral lessons mean nothing to them. It is about preserving the infallible word of a book despite how insane they may look.","challenge-both-sides","03:15 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","134"

I've run into anti-religious self-professed conspiracy-theorist atheists who also believed the lunar landing was faked. Also, you really need to differentiate, as well, in terms of ""creationists"". Creation and evolution are only incompatible concepts to two kinds of people: Christian fundamentalists and belligerent atheists (who, for some reason have an axe to grind even against religious evolutionists). Theistic evolutionists are still creationists, but you have no good reason to call them ignorant. They've observed the evidence of evolution and agree that it's a very real thing.","challenge-both-sides","03:48 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","135"
