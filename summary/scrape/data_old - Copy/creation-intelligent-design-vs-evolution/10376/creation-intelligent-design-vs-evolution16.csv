I posted my challenge so that I would be able to convert you all one at a time, rather than having to crush you all at the same time. It's easier, but it takes longer. To believe Genesis is to believe God 's word. You are a bit mixed up.","obvious_child","286468","Link. Irrelevant. Don't you read Sun Tzu? Um...dude, you don't even understand the difference between matter and energy...and think that that Universe is a 2d plane. Do you really think you can win here? And your arguments don't prove Genesis and rely upon false dichotomies. Wrong. If God created the world as he said in the Bible, then he's a liar as there is no evidence of that and he's deliberately deceiving us. If God created the world as we see today, then he's a liar in the bible. Either way, if you believe in Literal Genesis, you believe in a liar God You won't be able to refute that argument. None of the Creationists here can. They just run away.","challenge-both-sides","10:56 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","227"

That alone refutes you.","challenge-both-sides","10:58 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","228"

Maybe if you could clarify exactly what your challenge is...? Or we could knock a few ideas around and decide between ourselves what the resolution is we ought to debate. I don't mind.","challenge-both-sides","09:07 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","230"

I've made a few suggestions in your thread, to get you started.","challenge-both-sides","08:46 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","235"
