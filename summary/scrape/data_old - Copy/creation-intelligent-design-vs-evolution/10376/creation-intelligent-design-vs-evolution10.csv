They reject the science of evolution yet freely use the products of sciences that all say evolution is true. How can evolution be false when all of the sciences that make up evolution bring you viable products using much of the same science? It doesn't, but creationism is nothing more then a lifestyle of lies.","lesz","285680","I'm afraid that long experience of debating Creationists has forced me to a similar conclusion. Still, I think the only professional, knowing liars amongst them are the professional Creationists, the ones who teach IDiocy for a living.

"09-29-2007","10376",10,"jyoshu","285679","Also, you really need to differentiate, as well, in terms of ""creationists"". Creation and evolution are only incompatible concepts to two kinds of people: Christian fundamentalists and belligerent atheists (who, for some reason have an axe to grind even against religious evolutionists). Theistic evolutionists are still creationists, but you have no good reason to call them ignorant. They've observed the evidence of evolution and agree that it's a very real thing.","obvious_child","285686","it's kind of assumed we're talking exclusively about fundementalist, literal genesis believers. I'm a Deist. I believe that God set in motion for all that has become, including evolution and then promptly left it to its own devices. It snapped its fingers and the big bang started and then it walked off with its incorporeal legs to do something else and hasn't been back or looked back in over 16~ billion years.","challenge-both-sides","04:07 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","138"
"09-29-2007","10376",10,"Vinterland","285702","I would expect one who denies the Divinity of Christ to actually give logical reasons why, but all you've demonstrated it your ability to commit argument from outrage. The question of Jesus and God has compartively much more evidence than say, the existence of the FSM. I should expect a challenge to the veracity of the Gospels' and the Testimonium flavianum. Your claims however, are made by faith: ""What one discovers of course is that SIN (esp original SIN) is a guilt trap designed to enslave one to some religious authority who can bail you out, and that there is neither SIN nor the authority.""","lesz","285707","To be honest, I would expect one who makes the extraordinary claim that Christ was a god to provide the extraordinary proofs of the claim. Well, they are both fictional characters. Have you met either of them in real life? You want us to treat the gospels as if they were historical truth, without any corroborative evidence. Why? Look, we don't even know for sure that Christ existed as a genuine historical figure, and wasn't a work of complete fiction, like Hamlet or Capt. Ahab. Then you want us to leap to the extraordinary conclusion he wasn't merely a real person, but also a god. Now why would you expect us to do this?","challenge-both-sides","05:05 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","140"

Its a guilt trap invented by Religion. The Greeks for example recognized error or inappropriate behavior but did not hod the concept of sin.

"09-29-2007","10376",10,"chemist99a","285640","The same way that pre-biblical humans came to hold religious viewpoints, Evolution did not lead to atheism. Its fairly easy to take the intellectual stance that there are no GODs. Have you ever seen one? Do you believe your senses? Are those senses and your reason the way you survive and deal sucessfuly with the world around you? Is the idea of a GOD necessary to explain the world, or is it more likely that you do not know it all yet but can learn over time? Logic and reason are very old human capabilities. We invented ""GOD"" in the same way that engineers invented Murphy! As a placeholder for things about which we are ignorant at a given point in time. Much like the mapmakers of old -not having complete knowledge of the earths geography- put in ""here there be monsters"" and as knowledge accumulated took those signs down and replaced them with the best information they had.","marc9000","285719","It may be easy to take the intellectual stance that there is no God when you're young, but it seems to me it would get harder and harder the older you get. There's so much order and complexity in the very small part of the universe that we've been able to observe, and yet this one little world we live on exibits so much more of it than any we can observe anywhere else. We have love and hate, good and bad, right and wrong. It's also easy to believe that there is a plan, be it for each individuals life, or the entire span of mans time here. Mans time here is going by lightening fast, by the way. There are roughly 6 billion people on the planet now, there were only about 3 billion 52 short years ago when I was born. It was sometime in the late 1800's before we reached one billion. I'm not saying I'm afraid of overpopulation, but something or things are going to happen, very shortly when compared to billions of years, that's going to end mans time here. The idea of God really is necessary to explain the world to me. I don't believe the writers of the Bible, men who lived thousand of years ago, could have explained it so well without divine guidance. If I was an atheist, I would expect people who lived 2000 or more years ago to be animal-like ignorant, with no capacity to know how to do things like manage money and treat fellow human beings. The Bible describes those things perfectly when applied today. If I was an atheist, I would expect everyone alive today to have learned how to manage money and treat fellow human beings. Anyone with a pulse can look around themselves today and see more and more people who are animal like ignorant when it comes to those two things. A degeneration of behavior. Christianity predicts it - evolution does not.","challenge-both-sides","07:21 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","143"
"09-29-2007","10376",10,"chemist99a","285641","Darwin came to hold the personal belief of atheism. And yes he was bitter about his daughter. But he was not an evangelical atheist (ie an advocate) so far as I know. For an advocate you should look to Huxley - Darwins Bulldog. Now there was an advocate. And who would not wish to make GOD go away considering the death and destruction he has hurled upon mankind in the myths of the bible? When GOD shows up its truly bad news for mankind. Floods, plagues, flies, water pollution, death of first sons, having ones wife turn to salt, destruction of property and whole cities, forced apple free diets, and even the forced death of his own human offspring. Wanting GOD to go away is perfectly logical.","marc9000","285720","Yes I know, and Huxley was the one who invented the innocent term ""agnostic"". Small wonder that term is so misused today. God is here now, he keeps your heart beating for example. Would thanking him for sparing you from all the horrendous things you describe above not be a good idea? It is for me.","challenge-both-sides","07:25 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","144"
"09-29-2007","10376",10,"chemist99a","285642","Well lets ask this. Would you have scientists determine what is and is not GOD? The community of practitioners of a field so far as I know are always the people who define what that field is and how its practiced. Lawyers define what the practice of law IS, physicians, plumbers, gardners, and a host of others. WHO else would be sufficiently acquainted with a field than the practitioners???????? And provided that the genetic and biochemical mechanisms which might lead to religion are accessible to empirical experimentation and investigation they are fair game for science and scientists. Any material process which is accessible is grist for the mill of science. Would you somehow restrict the scope of scientific investigation to avoid any possible study of such things? On what basis might I ask? That man was not meant to know? Well if we were not meant to know, then presumably any such studies would fail. No harm in giving it a go is there? Sure they do and they have done exactly that. But so far as empirical science their efforts are a bust. Of course that could change tomorrow and when they publish some evidence which actually is scientifically supportive of their hypothesis then I will be glad to study their materials, methods, and conclusions. As to not being religious - well the major proponents have all indicated that they consider the ""intelligent designer"" to be their personally concieved GOD. Given that they are religious and ID is religious. And the courts have after reviewing the relationships and connections declared ID to be religious. On the other hand they have as much right as anyone else to carry out their own empirical investigations and compete in the universe of competing ideas. I do not think they will achieve much , but they are free to compete. Oh yes - we all define ourselves please note! Its obvious that any enterprise performed by humans will not be unbiased. Scientific conclusions are necessarily biased and non-neutral. For example a physics PhD would not be neutral if asked whether weight was the determinant of how long it takes an object to fall to the ground from the top of a tower. He will likely tell you that objects as diverse as a grape and a lead ball will hit the ground at about the same time even though the two objects have very different weights. That of course is discriminatory against the theories which hold otherwise, but it cannot be helped. How could that scientist be neutral in a society which holds as a general rule that the heavier object falls fastest? He cannot if he wishes to maintain his scientific integrity.","marc9000","285727","They are politically attempting to determine what is not God at the present. No they're not, they're called ID and they're blocked by the courts, from public funding and from public education. Separation of church and state. So that atheism and state can continue their loving relationship. ANY material process would include evidence of design. Not the identity of the designer, just evidence of design. When a large part of the material process is evidence against design, for social and political gain, there is a double standard. There has also been a major bust in evolution. The recent discoveries of the complexities of the simplest forms of life. Darwin knew nothing about them. Chances of them arising by chance decreases exponentially. A William Dembski analogy shows it very well. I don't remember what he was applying it to, but I've posted it at these forums before, don't remember exactly where. I remember the basics. A combination lock with a left-right-left combination and a 1 to 39 numbered dial has a one in 64,000 probability of being opened by chance. (40x40x40) That could be the equivalent of mice spontaniously generating from dirty hay, as was believed by some in Darwins day. A somewhat more complicated combination would be turned in 5 directions, left-right-left-right-left, with a 1 to 99 numbered dial. When we multiply 100x100x100x100x100, we don't get 64,000 any more, we get 10 BILLION. It's a good analogy - it shows that what Darwin believed happened by chance and what todays atheists believe happened by chance are not even remotely comparable. What is the difference between proponents of ID admitting they are religious, as opposed to most biologists today who admit they are atheist? Why is one trusted and the other not? A double standard. Without public money and future generations minds, I'm sure you're right about what they'll achieve. If they achieve something, heavily funded atheist attack dogs combined with indoctrination of students in schools should void it out very well. Apples and oranges. That kind of non-neutrality does not have social and political implications.","challenge-both-sides","08:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","145"
"09-29-2007","10376",10,"chemist99a","285643","By no means since I agree that science (or at least scientists) are not neutral. They tend to call em as they see em and that cannot be neutral And when one does not know then the ONLY rational response is ""I don't know"". When its impossible to test a hypothesis the only answer is ""I don't know, and I cannot know"". ""I don't know"" is in fact the starting point for every major scientific investigation. If one knew there is no need to spend the time and effort involved in doing the science. No ""good"" rationalist would reply ""Sure I know the answer to that"" when he does not. The technical term is telling a lie. In summary Science and scientists cannot do science and remain neutral on matters of social and political debate. Its literally impossible since the science will almost certainly support one side of such debates more than another. Scientists should be truthful you know thats one of the ideals of the field.","marc9000","285731","In a society such as the U.S. they should stop short of that. I agree, Richard Dawkins writes books full of lies. Or are they just his personal opinion, so that makes them allright? Is it allright when college professors make his books (and others like them) required reading for a science course? The science won't, but the human scientists will. There is a big difference. They're not always truthful with the ""I don't know"" part. How about this for a resolution; In the U.S., science SHOULD be neutral and balanced, in social and political matters. With the old resolution, I'd have probably gone for 1000 word limits, in this one I believe I'd ask for 1500 - it is probably a better resolution. I do enjoy tangling with you - you put your thoughts in print very well, and keep the insults down. I just wish I had more time. I can make time for another formal debate though. How about it? - a good time will be had by all.","challenge-both-sides","08:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","146"

The probability of the GOD hypothesis being true shrinks and shrinks and shrinks. Sufficiently so that one has to BELIEVE that its actually zero - although one cannot prove that as a scientific hypothesis. Nice try but that implies that you have an actual way of measuring complexity which you clearly do not. Do you really think that the earth is more complex than the galaxy, or the local group, or the non-earth component of the entire universel? Its a most insane assumption. Its also easy to believe that we should have invaded Iraq and that we should stay there forever. Its easy to believe that there is a free lunch. Its easy to believe in Santa Claus. Ease of belief does not validate any belief. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. For all either of us know the human population could start dropping and go to 100 million or so before stabilizing. And yes things are going to happen - thats what time is for to keep everything from happening at once. If indeed you need GOD to explain the world to you, then you are woefully lacking in both vision and imagination. Well you are not an atheist and I am. I by no means believe as you describe. Indeed as a scientist I understand and know that the ancients had economies, trade with each other, and even pretty decent civil engineering. Your projections about what I as an atheist believe are totally off base from what I DO think. Again you are not and expecting EVERYBODY to understand money management is just plain insane esp in view of the abundant empirical evidence to the contrary. And why would you think that human nature would change much. The romans had the gladatorial contests, we have Monday night football and pro wrestling. Bread and circuses are ever popular. Well lets see the data. What proportion of ancient Romans who carried credit cards were in arrears? What proportion had subprime loans outstanding? How many had 401Ks and how many handled their stock investments online? And I would like you to provide a specific reference in the holy texts of Christian doctrine which make the prediction that money management skills will devolve and that treatment of humans will devolve. By the way do you have data on the slave counts in ancient Rome and those in say Cleveland today? Would you like to count Roman crucifixions against legal execution rates today? Would you provide a good count of the number of Christians lit afire on the White House lawn compared to those in Neros Garden? To my eyes you are suffering from a strong positive bias toward conditions in past history which of course you did not observe or experience. Do you think the 1 st century after christ was a golden age or something? If so why? Or do you think the 14'th century in England was a golden age?","challenge-both-sides","09:18 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","148"
