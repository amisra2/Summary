Now just how do you think gene expression is controlled? How do you think expression of such genes is altered in a heritable way? I can give you a hint! Various forms of mutation of the controller genes! And let us not forget that the trait segregates as a polygenic trait. Look at the crossbreeding experiment once more. the F1s and F2 hybrids! Its a classic pattern and to get it you have to have genetic changes ie mutations.","official-challenge-returns","11:05 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","62"

This is not the same as claiming a mutation was responsible. At the very least, the author is unsure of the exact mechanism. So if he is unsure then it's pretty safe to say no one knows for sure....if no one knows for sure, then your original assumption is just that: an assumption. Besides that, a population of bacteria could never evolve into a population of humans by way of losing something or having body parts reduced/eliminated....this is why I put this stipulation in my challenge to find a mutation that added on to an existing structure in a beneficial way......","official-challenge-returns","02:46 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","66"

See Figure 4 in http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pag...95&pageindex=3 The homebox gene set basically sculpts the multiplying cells of the blastula into the complex shapes of adult animals.

C'mmon. You need a source of evolutionary novelty that can add new, selectable morphological features at random and you don't have one. Period. Lynn Margulis: Mutation accumulation does not lead to new species or even to new organs or new tissues. Lynn Margulis Acquiring Genomes Pg. 11 ]""I have seen no evidence whatsoever that these [evolutionary] changes can occur through the accumulation of gradual mutations."" About random mutations...""They are like printers' errors that crop up in the copying of books. They rarely clarifty or enhance meaning. Such small random changes are nearly always inconsequential or detrimental to the work as a whole . Although random mutations influenced the course of evolution, their influence was mainly by loss, alteration, and refinement. One mutation confers resistance to malaria but also makes happy blood cells into the deficient oxygen carries of sickle cell anemics. Another mutation converts a gorgeous newborn into a cystic fibrosis patient or a victim of early onset diabetes. One mutation causes a flighty red-eyed fruit fly to fail to take wing. Never, however, did that one mutation make a wing, a fruit, a woody stem, or a claw appear. Mutations, in summary, tend to induce sickness, death, or deficiencies . No evidence in the vast leterature of heredity change shows unambiguous evidence that random mutation itself, even with geographical isolation of populations, leads to speciation.
