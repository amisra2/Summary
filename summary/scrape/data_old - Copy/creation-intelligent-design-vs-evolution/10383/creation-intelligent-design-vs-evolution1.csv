There are mutations that duplicate existing structures, mutations that reduce existing structures, mutations that deform organisms, and mutations that cause disease and death....Unfortunately for Darwinists, however, mutations can add nothing beneficial to the observable phenotype, which is the cornerstone of ToE. Knowing this, it is my honest opinion that the theory of evolution is little more than a wacky metaphysical belief, much like astrology or palm reading. The floor is open!","official-challenge-returns","10:01 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","1"
"09-15-2007","10383",1,"chemist99a","284059","Once more the challenge is answered. The conversion of codon 6 for the B chain of hemoglobin from a triplet coding glutamic acid to a triplet coding for valine. This point mutation makes the hetrozygous phenotype significantly resistant to malaria and thus confers a benefit. QED.","supersport","284060","read my challenge and try again. ""resistance"" is not this: new, beneficial, selectable morphological addition to an existing body part....(one that alters physical, outward appearance in a beneficial way.)","official-challenge-returns","10:16 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","3"

""resistance"" is not this: new, beneficial, selectable morphological addition to an existing body part....(one that alters physical, outward appearance in a beneficial way.)","chemist99a","284061","Of course it is. Its new, its beneficial, its morphological {ask the parasite if you don't believe me} and hemoglobin is/was an existing body part. Its a part and its part of the body just as much as your nose is. As to outward appearance consider the difference between an infected normal who is exhibiing the effects of malaria and an infected but resistant phenotype which is NOT exhibiting those same outward signs. Or do you consider the susceptible phenotype lyng there sick as a dog and the resistant phenotype watching in pity not to be an outward appearance????? Which of the two is more likely to find and breed with a desirable mate and have children? You think the one thats dying has a good shot at that do ya?","official-challenge-returns","10:33 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","4"
"09-15-2007","10383",1,"None","None","None","chemist99a","284062","You have failed to construct your requirements sufficiently precisely. You need to be less ambiguous thus leaving loopholes to work through. Let me give you a hint. You should limit the scope of your challenge to the shape of human eyebrows and nobody (so far as I know) will be able to provide you a credible example although perhaps there are such especially involving sexual selection. I personally favor human females with a nice arch as opposed to straiight across, but thats just me. You might also consider limiting your challenge to the rate of fingernail growth or perhaps canine tooth shape etc.","official-challenge-returns","10:38 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","5"

In many forms of the disease, the red blood cells change shape, upon deoxygenation because of polymerization of the abnormal sickle hemoglobin. This process damages the red blood cell membrane, and can cause the cells to become stuck in blood vessels http://www.stopsicklecell.com/ Sickle cell disease is caused by a genetic defect in the globin gene you have failed, failed, and failed again -- every time you bring up this nonsense you just add to the failures. here's my challenge again: I challenge evolutionists to show me ONE mutation ever documented in the history of science that has created a new, beneficial, selectable morphological addition to an existing body part....(one that alters physical, outward appearance in a beneficial way.)","official-challenge-returns","11:00 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","6"
"09-15-2007","10383",1,"None","None","None","chemist99a","284064","Its not a defect if you have to contend with malaria! Being heterozygous lets more live than would the absense of the gene. No benefit is unalloyed you realize. Having five fingers is beneficial under some circumstances and a defect under others. Thats what NS is alll about. NS in the malaria belts selects FOR what you call a defect - because at that place and time that ""defect"" confers a net advantage. Of course you can feel free to contest the data to that effect, but there are multiple lines of such data and you will have a long row to hoe. Or as they might say in the malarial belts - Whiteman cannot survive without drugs and other aids. They just don't have the blood lines to do so. Its obvious that THEIR hemoglobin is defective because of that glutamate at codon 6. Its terrible to have such a genetic disease.","official-challenge-returns","11:04 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","7"
"09-15-2007","10383",1,"chemist99a","284064","Its not a defect if you have to contend with malaria! .","supersport","284066","Man alive! It's a defect in structure ......I could be hit in the head with a baseball bat, denting it and making it smaller, which would be beneficial if I had to put on a child's batting helmet, but the dent is still an abnormality of structure that was caused by an assault. Your example is nothing of what I asked for...... read it again...(I've even highlighted what I want you to concentrate on.)

Your example is nothing of what I asked for......","Symbiote","284070","So you want an mutation that causes a change in structure, but you don't want an abnormality of structure, there's an honest request if I ever saw one. Obviously every mutation will be ""abnormal"", that's what makes it a mutation, it departs from the pre-existing norm. It is completely dishonest to ask for such mutations and then reject them because they are abnormal.","official-challenge-returns","11:22 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","12"
"09-15-2007","10383",1,"None","None","None","Symbiote","284072","Ah but its an ""abnormal"" feature, and that makes it bad, because we know a priori that the ""intelligent designer"" creates things perfect, and that all ""abnormalities"" that occur due to genetic change are therefore counter to the will of the divine spirit - EVIL if you will.","official-challenge-returns","11:27 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","14"
