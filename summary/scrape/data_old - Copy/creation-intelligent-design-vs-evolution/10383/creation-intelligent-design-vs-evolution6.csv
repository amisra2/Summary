Worth a read.","official-challenge-returns","11:21 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","78"
"09-18-2007","10383",6,"N.Wells","284188","Duplicate, then modify and do some deletions: see what happened to the homeobox genes in vertebrates - two doublings, yielding four sets, and then many of the duplicates got whacked out during recombination. See Figure 4 in http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pag...95&pageindex=3 The homeobox gene set basically sculpts the multiplying cells of the blastula into the complex shapes of adult animals.","N.Wells","284441","Pharyngula just had an excellent post on homeobox genes in mice ( http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2...e_hox_code.php ). This addresses several of SS's concerns. 1) As far as I know, findings still show the homeobox components to be tightly clustered genes. 2) Quite clearly the genes are controlling morphology, as proven by the knockout experiments. 3) You can see the genes at work growing the ribs (much in the fashion of building a stone wall) and building the limbs, so we can see where limbs come from. 4) It is easy to infer that simple modification of the expression of the homeobox genes will modify morphology in very workable ways, such that failing to shut down rib or limb or tail growth as quickly as usual will produce longer ribs, longer limbs, or a longer tail. 5) The first figure in the post nicely illustrates the effects of duplication followed by modification of some genes and removal of others.","official-challenge-returns","09:14 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","79"
