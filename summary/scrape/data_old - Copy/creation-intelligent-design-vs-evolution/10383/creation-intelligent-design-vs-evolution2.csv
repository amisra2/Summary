"09-15-2007","10383",2,"Symbiote","284070","So you want an mutation that causes a change in structure, but you don't want an abnormality of structure, there's an honest request if I ever saw one. Obviously every mutation will be ""abnormal"", that's what makes it a mutation, it departs from the pre-existing norm. It is completely dishonest to ask for such mutations and then reject them because they are abnormal.","supersport","284075","No, an advantageous structure is not an ""abnormal structure. Get real. See, I can answer my own challenge....I can show how new structures and modifications are generated -- the only problem is it contradicts the materialist/randomness/accidental requirement of darwinists: http://discovermagazine.com/2006/nov...tart:int=1&-C= To the surprise of scientists, many environmentally induced changes turn out to be heritable. When exposed to predators, Daphnia water fleas grow defensive spines (right). The effect can last for several generations So I've got my proof.......where's yours?","official-challenge-returns","11:47 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"
"09-15-2007","10383",2,"chemist99a","284074","OK I will try again this time taking your formatting into account. I have bolded each word or phrase you emphasized just for reference. Changing glutamate to valine adds a new amino acid at position 6 in the hemoblobin - its an additon in that it adds a hydrophobic group. Hemoglobin most certainly is both a body part and one which existed before the mutation occurred. And in infected persons the mutation most certainly does improve the outward appearance - healthy people look much different than those suffering from malaria. And people who die of malaria certainly have an inferior outward appearance to those that are able to withstand the assault (by the parasite - not baseball bats). Does that cover you objections?","supersport","284076","what do you think.....why don't you let someone else try. I've seen much better attempts than what you're presenting. You seem to be just glossing over these particular words: a new, beneficial, selectable morphological addition to an existing body part you've even admitted that the molecule is defected...so let's move on.","official-challenge-returns","11:50 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","18"
"09-15-2007","10383",2,"Symbiote","284072","Ah but its an ""abnormal"" feature, and that makes it bad, because we know a priori that the ""intelligent designer"" creates things perfect, and that all ""abnormalities"" that occur due to genetic change are therefore counter to the will of the divine spirit - EVIL if you will.","chemist99a","284077","Well there is that. But one must ask if the core assumption is valid. If it is then the fact that Eve could be tempted into eating that apple is the original design defect and belies the assumption that the designer was a perfect one. Perhaps GOD just isn't the designer his PR firm tries to present him as. And Bill Gates isn't either - but they will get windows bug free on the next go I am sure of it!","official-challenge-returns","11:51 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","19"

I am not using anything like the full bandwidth of this site. And I did or at least I think I did deal with all your words. New (yep covered that) Beneficial (yep covered that) Selectable (yep thats implied in the population dynamics -the gene is selected) Morphological (yep covered that - hemoglobin is an anatomical thing) Addition (yep covered that) Existing Body Part (yep covered that too) Frankly I think I satisfied your challenge and successfully defended my example - do I get a prize or something? And I did not admit that ""the molecule is a defect"" in fact I showed you that in the malarial belt ""normal hemoglobin"" is defective since those carrying that genetic defect are quite susceptible to a disease unless they have access to medical support services. In the malarial belt the heterozygous phenotype is hardly a defect its an improvement over the normal hemoglobin.","official-challenge-returns","11:54 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","20"
"09-16-2007","10383",2,"chemist99a","284079","But of course those horns are in your terms a defect. They are indeed an impediment when the predator is not present and they result in decreased populations of Daphnia compared to the unhorned variant! So the response of Daphnia to a predator is to generate a defective morphology - at least thats the conclusion when we apply your own argument! Oops.","supersport","284081","it's a biological response to the predator...the mind in action...the spine is just a physical manifestation of the mental processes that go on behind the scenens....if the predators moved on to new locations the new offspring would probably revert back to the norm.","official-challenge-returns","12:08 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","23"
"09-16-2007","10383",2,"chemist99a","284080","So please explain in detail how the Dapnina system actually works! I wait with bated breath for you explanation of how genetic plasticity dependent on the secretion of a specific trigger compound by the predator is non-material and involves intelligence, and just how the secretion of similar compounds by the spiky Daphnia which maintain the effect contradicts materialism in any way. Good luck. Consider it a challenge. I leave it up to you to chase the relevant papers down in the literature. I have done it in the past and know what I am talking about. If you simply ignore them I will beat you badly about the head with them as necessary.","supersport","284082","who cares how it works.....when you were in school and answered math problems on paper, did your teacher come around and ask to look inside your brain to figure out what the mechanism was so she could verify how you got the right answer right? No!...the proof was right there in front of her....who cares how the answer was arrived at. Ultimately life has no mechanism -- at least no scientific mechanism that can be measured. Life goes against science at every turn.","official-challenge-returns","12:11 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","24"

Beneficial -- we've been through that -- you can't prove that either. Selectable? -- the mutation cannot be proven to be a random thing, so no, that cannot be proven...besides that, we've already confirmed that sickle cell does not lead to an increased likelihood to breed over malaria. Morphological? I asked for an observable body part...remember, a mutation that beneficially altered external appearance? Failed here too Addition? No physical structure was added to. Failed. Existing body part? Proteins and other molecules are not observable body parts. Chemist...please quit playing games. You know what I'm looking for. Evolutionists have cited changes in organisms' phenotypes as evidence of evolution....changes in beak shapes, changes in fur color, changes in wing color, changes in leg length etc etc etc..........What I am looking for is any mutation that can validate the claim that ToE has made that animals ""evolve"" morphologically by way of RMNS. I'm looking for any mutation that can provide the raw material -- a change in external, visible phenotype for which selection can act upon. You are simply fooling around and avoiding my challenge. Instead of a physical trait, you cite me a disease that results in a series of defects, cliaming that these defects make the organism more fit. That doesn't cut it.","official-challenge-returns","12:21 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","25"
"09-16-2007","10383",2,"chemist99a","284084","Well if you don't know how it works how can you make a claim that it proves your case! If you don't know how it works you have no proof of what you are claiming at all. If I were to say I did not care how the sickle cell trait system and malaria interacted and still used it to prove my case what would your response be? Would you accept my claim without dispute, would it be proof of my contention. No way - you would be on me like a duck on a junebug. You had bloody well care about how systems you claim as proof of a hypothetical mechanism work - else be laughed off the stage at even a grammer school argument! I can see Newton saying well these orbital data prove my point - but I don't care or know how it works!!!!!! High credibility - I think not.","supersport","284086","The difference is the results of the experiment are self-explanatory in that it's obvious that the newly-generated structure was a result of an interaction between the organism and predator(s). Therefore, randomness is ruled out, which is all that's required to undermine the foundation of darwinism and materialism. How it might have happened might be fun for scientists to sort out, but I have no real interest in it....partially because it is clear that mental processes were ultimately responsible, and mental processes cannot be fully understood anyway, so why bother?","official-challenge-returns","12:34 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","28"
"09-16-2007","10383",2,"chemist99a","284085","Well I do have a counter example to your claim. I will make the claim that you cannot give me an example of an organism which can survive temperatures above the melting point of tungsten. Bet ya basically any amount you want. If life ignores science then you should be able to find an example somewhere!!!! And by the way if life has no mechanism why do we have all those joints and muscles and mitochondria and reproductive cells an organs and..........","supersport","284087","well gosh, chemist...show me a lifeform that can exist in outerspace...your challenge could be extended in numerous directions......just because life is not scientific does not mean everything is possible.","official-challenge-returns","12:36 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","29"
