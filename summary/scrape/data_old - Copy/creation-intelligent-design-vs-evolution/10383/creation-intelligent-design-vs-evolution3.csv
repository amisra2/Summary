But beware other people DO know how your favorite system you use for proof works and those papers are still out there waiting to be molded into swords to slice up your argument.","official-challenge-returns","01:02 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","32"

How is that trees can alter their metabolism to make more antifeeding compounds when nearby trees are attacked by insects? Do you know that system either? Why do bannas ripen more rapidly when contained in a closed space????","official-challenge-returns","01:06 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","33"
"09-16-2007","10383",3,"chemist99a","284089","I did not say the response was random. Indeed its clearly a wide spread non-mutaional process which affects a fair fraction of the population in question. But its also not an evolutionary change is it? Or don't you know (or care?) how it works yet? And sorting it out is essential if you wish to make claims about how it works which you are in fact doing. And if you have no interest in the key proof of your argument you are not treating the issue in a serious way are you. Talk about playing games. You apparently prefer to make claims of proof based on things which you know little or nothing about - how easy that must make it - till someone points that out of course. And you think mental processes are responsible yet I will bet that you have never even seen a live daphnia let alone examined ones brain or taught one to perform circus tricks, or coverse! You argument ends of course with the immortal words... So now you admit that its due to mental processes but you have no understanding of those processes and you are too lazy intellectually to examine the very observations which you have oddly enough chosen to make the centerpiece of how you belive life functions. WOW","supersport","284095","not, I'm not lazy at all...I'm just not interested......I don't even like science. It bores me.","official-challenge-returns","01:09 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","34"

Feel free to educate me. And after you answer that you can answer how it is when I eat something my body knows which of the thousands of digestive enzymes to release in order to properly digest the food. And then you can tell me how it is when I injure myself (cuts, scrapes, burns, bruises, sprains, twisted knee, jammed finger, paper cut, splinters, etc etc etc) my body always seems to know just how to repair these -- quickly.","official-challenge-returns","01:16 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","36"

I see no reason to spend effort on an utterly futile cause with less chance than we have of seeing a fully functional democratic gov in Iraq within 6 months.

"09-16-2007","10383",3,"chemist99a","284096","Yes its abundantly clear that you know little or nothing about the subjects of your posts. Ignorance is not a pretty sight. Scientific ignorance is a disgusting one. Deliberate and uncaring scientific ignorance cannot be looked upon without using a mirror of some sort lest ones own brain turn to stone.","supersport","284099","chemist, I may not have a love for science like you do but there is more to life than science -- I know that may be hard for you to digest...but life is more than chemicals and molecules. I have other pleasures and hobbies than always sticking my nose in science books.","official-challenge-returns","01:23 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","38"

Tell me how the body knows to do this....what is the mental process and how does that work? How does it sense an injury and then always fix it the right way the first time? A code? What code? How is the code read?....who does the reading?...who sends the messages?...who receives them?....how does this communication happen?...what language?...can you decipher this language?

"09-16-2007","10383",3,"N.Wells","284102","You've lost this several times already, but you keep trying new versions. It is an impressive testimony to your lack of skill that you still can't devise an airtight and loophole-free challenge. Evolutionary theory, unlike you, recognizes that advantageousness (and disadvantageousness) depend on context, which can quickly change. Also, a single modification can simultaneously confer reproductive benefits and disadvantages. Thus, despite its disadvantages, sickle cell is net advantageous for lineages that live in malarial regions (and lack modern medicines). But let's go with a couple more mutations. First, myostatin blocker in humans is a mutation that causes an impressive increase in muscle & strength that is externally visible and which as yet has no known downside. (However, some disadvantages have been seen in cows with a comparable mutation.) See http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5278028/ . I agree that reproductive advantages have yet to be established, as the boy is not even ten years old yet, but it is clear that at some times and places in human history this could have been a very reproductively beneficial mutation, even if it in some way shortened his life to 25 years or so. Next, let's talk about the benefits of the loss of vision in one type of blind cave fish. This is external and morphological, but no doubt you'll complain that this is loss and degradation and thus not an improvement. However, not so fast: From http://findarticles.com/p/articles/m...n13811128/pg_1 There's clearly no need for eyes in a cave, so this is not really a defect. Improvement in olfaction is clearly beneficial in a cave, so this enhancement is new and beneficial.","supersport","284105","the cow thing is just a duplication of what's already there (muscles)....nothing new....nothing added to an existing structure....just more of the same. The cave fish eye hardly works either....is that a mutation? I don't think so.","official-challenge-returns","01:51 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","42"
"09-16-2007","10383",3,"None","None","None","N.Wells","284106","The orignal muscle was an existing body part, and it has now been added too, with new muscle, as per your challenge, ""a new, beneficial, selectable morphological addition to an existing body part"". Your thinking that a change in a specific gene does not constitute a mutation is not worth discussing, but let me simply note that eyeless cave fish have eyeless offspring.","official-challenge-returns","02:21 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","43"
