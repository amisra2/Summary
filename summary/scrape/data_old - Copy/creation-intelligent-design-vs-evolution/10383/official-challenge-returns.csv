And in infected persons the mutation most certainly does improve the outward appearance - healthy people look much different than those suffering from malaria.

It is an impressive testimony to your lack of skill that you still can't devise an airtight and loophole-free challenge. Evolutionary theory, unlike you, recognizes that advantageousness (and disadvantageousness) depend on context, which can quickly change. Also, a single modification can simultaneously confer reproductive benefits and disadvantages. Thus, despite its disadvantages, sickle cell is net advantageous for lineages that live in malarial regions (and lack modern medicines). But let's go with a couple more mutations. First, myostatin blocker in humans is a mutation that causes an impressive increase in muscle & strength that is externally visible and which as yet has no known downside. (However, some disadvantages have been seen in cows with a comparable mutation.) See http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5278028/ . I agree that reproductive advantages have yet to be established, as the boy is not even ten years old yet, but it is clear that at some times and places in human history this could have been a very reproductively beneficial mutation, even if it in some way shortened his life to 25 years or so. Next, let's talk about the benefits of the loss of vision in one type of blind cave fish. This is external and morphological, but no doubt you'll complain that this is loss and degradation and thus not an improvement. However, not so fast: From http://findarticles.com/p/articles/m...n13811128/pg_1 There's clearly no need for eyes in a cave, so this is not really a defect.

The evolutionary mechanisms responsible for eye degeneration in cave-adapted animals have not been resolved. Opposing hypotheses invoking neural mutation or natural selection, each with certain genetic and developmental expectations, have been advanced to explain eye regression, although little or no experimental evidence has been presented to support or reject either theory. Here we review recent developmental and molecular studies in the teleost Astyanax mexicanus, a single species consisting of a sighted surface-dwelling form (surface fish) and many blind cave-dwelling forms (cavefish), which shed new light on this problem. The manner of eye development and degeneration, the ability to experimentally restore eyes, gene expression patterns, and comparisons between different cavefish populations all provide important clues for understanding the evolutionary forces responsible for eye degeneration. A key discovery is that Hedgehog midline signaling is expanded and inhibits eye formation by inducing lens apoptosis in cavefish embryos. Accordingly, eyes could have been lost by default as a consequence of natural selection for constructive traits, such as feeding structures, which are positively regulated by Hh signaling. We conclude from these studies that eye degeneration in cavefish may be caused by adaptive evolution and pleiotropy.","official-challenge-returns","08:46 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","49"

Stated another way, this idea says that given enough time and a sufficiently high mutation rate, the eye is doomed to eventually disappear because it is not necessary for survival in the dark cave environment yet this guy's explanation: I propose an adaptive hypothesis to explain cavefish eye regression based the pleiotropic activity of midline signaling genes. Gene expression data and functional studies involving the negative role of Hh midline signaling during cavefish eye development strongly support this hypothesis. Enhanced Hh midline signaling in cavefish has a negative effect on eye development based on its ability to change the patterns of pax6 and pax2 expression , reduce the size of the eye primordia, and promote lens apoptosis and arrest eye growth expression, not mutation.","official-challenge-returns","09:00 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","52"

C'mmon. You need a source of evolutionary novelty that can add new, selectable morphological features at random and you don't have one. Period. Lynn Margulis: Mutation accumulation does not lead to new species or even to new organs or new tissues. Lynn Margulis Acquiring Genomes Pg. 11 ]""I have seen no evidence whatsoever that these [evolutionary] changes can occur through the accumulation of gradual mutations."" About random mutations...""They are like printers' errors that crop up in the copying of books. They rarely clarifty or enhance meaning. Such small random changes are nearly always inconsequential or detrimental to the work as a whole . Although random mutations influenced the course of evolution, their influence was mainly by loss, alteration, and refinement. One mutation confers resistance to malaria but also makes happy blood cells into the deficient oxygen carries of sickle cell anemics. Another mutation converts a gorgeous newborn into a cystic fibrosis patient or a victim of early onset diabetes. One mutation causes a flighty red-eyed fruit fly to fail to take wing. Never, however, did that one mutation make a wing, a fruit, a woody stem, or a claw appear. Mutations, in summary, tend to induce sickness, death, or deficiencies . No evidence in the vast leterature of heredity change shows unambiguous evidence that random mutation itself, even with geographical isolation of populations, leads to speciation.
