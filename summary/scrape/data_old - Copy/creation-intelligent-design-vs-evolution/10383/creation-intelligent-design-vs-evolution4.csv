Your thinking that a change in a specific gene does not constitute a mutation is not worth discussing, but let me simply note that eyeless cave fish have eyeless offspring.","supersport","284123","Why are you claiming mutation when this guy says it's not? http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/cgi.../full/96/3/185 you people are so easy. The evolutionary mechanisms responsible for eye degeneration in cave-adapted animals have not been resolved. Opposing hypotheses invoking neural mutation or natural selection, each with certain genetic and developmental expectations, have been advanced to explain eye regression, although little or no experimental evidence has been presented to support or reject either theory. Here we review recent developmental and molecular studies in the teleost Astyanax mexicanus, a single species consisting of a sighted surface-dwelling form (surface fish) and many blind cave-dwelling forms (cavefish), which shed new light on this problem. The manner of eye development and degeneration, the ability to experimentally restore eyes, gene expression patterns, and comparisons between different cavefish populations all provide important clues for understanding the evolutionary forces responsible for eye degeneration. A key discovery is that Hedgehog midline signaling is expanded and inhibits eye formation by inducing lens apoptosis in cavefish embryos. Accordingly, eyes could have been lost by default as a consequence of natural selection for constructive traits, such as feeding structures, which are positively regulated by Hh signaling. We conclude from these studies that eye degeneration in cavefish may be caused by adaptive evolution and pleiotropy.","official-challenge-returns","08:46 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","49"

"09-16-2007","10383",4,"None","None","None","supersport","284127","symbiote: The guy doesn't say it's ""not mutation "" from link: The neutral mutation hypothesis (Kimura and Ohta 1971) suggests that eye regression is caused by random mutations in eye-forming genes, which accumulate in cave animals under relaxed selective pressure (Culver 1982; Wilkens 1988). Stated another way, this idea says that given enough time and a sufficiently high mutation rate, the eye is doomed to eventually disappear because it is not necessary for survival in the dark cave environment yet this guy's explanation: I propose an adaptive hypothesis to explain cavefish eye regression based the pleiotropic activity of midline signaling genes. Gene expression data and functional studies involving the negative role of Hh midline signaling during cavefish eye development strongly support this hypothesis. Enhanced Hh midline signaling in cavefish has a negative effect on eye development based on its ability to change the patterns of pax6 and pax2 expression , reduce the size of the eye primordia, and promote lens apoptosis and arrest eye growth expression, not mutation.","official-challenge-returns","09:00 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","52"

He disagrees about the reasons such mutations become the norm... not the fact that they occur. Nothing you have cut and pasted says anything contrary to that, as I'm sure anyone who is actually literate will agree.","official-challenge-returns","09:05 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","53"
