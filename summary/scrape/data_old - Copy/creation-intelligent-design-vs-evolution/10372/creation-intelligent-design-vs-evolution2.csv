There is no KNOWN process in living organisms which is demonstrated to be anything other than the result of chemistry and physics. No ghosts in the machines so to speak. Lez's claim is frimly based in our current knowledge. So far as we know life is a chemical and physical effect.","gene-dead","08:39 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","16"

Biochemists have reconstituted many individual parts of living systems in the test-tube, up to the replication of DNA and the transcription and translation of genes. So no, there isn't any particular mystery about what makes life different from non-life. We understand the biochemistry of it pretty well. Here you skip from ""life"" to ""consciousness"". The initial question was about the telling the difference between living and non-living systems. The answer to that is known: it's chemistry. Some chemistries allow for metabolism, replication and evolution... most do not, but they are all different aspects of chemistry. Not all life, my friend, is conscious. Plants, viruses and bacteria are alive, but few would argue, today, that they are conscious. Now, you ask, how does chemistry account for consciousness? Well, it doesn't as yet. So far as we know, consciousness is what they call an emergent property of the physicochemical system of the brain. What's an ""emergent property""? It's a phenomenon we know has physical reality based on some material phenomenon, but which we do not yet understand. We know that many animal brains result in consciousness. We know that brains are physicochemical machines. We understand some things about how they work. We know that physical (a cosh) or chemical (drugs) disruption of the machine disrupts consciousness, but we don't know yet how the machine generates consciousness. So we don't know everything. That is hardly reason to appeal to some miraculous and vitalistic forces. This is no more than the usual appeal to the God of the Gaps, where every gap in physical knowledge is presumed to be filled by a divine miracle. Doesn't make scientific sense. besides, the gaps keep getting filled in with science. What are you going to do when science explains consciousness, eh? Find some new gap?","gene-dead","08:57 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","17"
"09-13-2007","10372",2,"jim's trucking","283681","Notwithstanding my ineptness in this field...alas, I am but a lowly electrical engineer...I anticipate being shown to be mistaken. Based on one scientific observation pointed out to me in an article written by someone who apparently knows what he's doing, I contend that a brainless animal such as a jelly fish can be chemically conscious of delectible morsels suspended in nearby ocean water and can send out its tentacles to retreave said food. Somehow, the brainless jelly fish ""knows"" the food is there. It's conscious of the presense of food. I believe it smells with chemically induced stimuli. Main Entry: consciousness Listen to the pronunciation of consciousness Pronunciation: \-ns\ Function: noun Date: 1629 1 a: the quality or state of being aware especially of something within oneself b: the state or fact of being conscious of an external object, state, or fact c: awareness; especially : concern for some social or political cause2: the state of being characterized by sensation, emotion, volition, and thought : mind3: the totality of conscious states of an individual4: the normal state of conscious life <regained consciousness>5: the upper level of mental life of which the person is aware as contrasted with unconscious processes The body of an adult jellyfish consists of a bell shape producing jelly and enclosing its internal structure, from which tentacles are suspended. Each tentacle is covered with cells called cnidocytes, that can sting or kill other animals. Most jellyfish use these cells to secure prey or for defense. Others, such as Rhizostomae, do not have tentacles at all. Jellyfish lack basic sensory organs and a brain, but their nervous systems and rhopalia allow them to perceive stimuli, such as light and odor, and respond quickly. They feed on small fish and zooplankton that become caught in their tentacles. Most jellyfish are passive drifters and slow swimmers, as their shape is not hydrodynamic. Instead, they move so as to create a current forcing the prey within reach of their tentacles. They do this by rhythmically opening and closing their bell-like body. Their digestive system is incomplete: the same orifice is used to take in food and expel waste. A jellyfish detects the touch of other animals using a nervous system called a ""nerve net"", found in its epidermis. Touch stimuli are collected by nerve rings, through the rhopalial lappet located around the animal's body, to the nerve cells. Jellyfish also have ocelli that cannot form images but are sensitive to light; the jellyfish can use these to determine up from down, basing its judgement on sunlight shining on the surface of the water.","chemist99a","283684","I don't think consscious and having an ablity to sense and respond are equivalent. I suppose its debatable to some extent, but the dictionary definition is not quite aligned with aware in the sense of chemosensory driven responses in a jelly fish. And the jelly fish is not wiithout a nervous system you know. In contrast a plant such as a sunflower will track the sun - its strictly chemical and the mechanisms are well known. Would you consider that to be conscious behavior? Most would not as its a tropism which is fully automatic and the sunflower has no nervous system at all. As to jellyfish specifically lets just pull quote from WIKI.\ Anatomy and morphology","gene-dead","09:48 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","19"

All organisms track changes in their environment physicochemically, and respond appropriately. Even a bacterium has chemoreceptors that tell it what sort of environment it's in. Some bacteria are even able to sense magnetic fields using microscopic crystals of magnetite. Many animals navigate in part using similar magnetic sensors. Organisms have to be sensitive to -- if you prefer, conscious of -- their environment. Of course, you might reply that sensitivity to and consciousness of are not quite the same things, and I wouldn't disagree. Biologists can't give you the answer to every interesting question; if they could, they'd be out of a job. However, biochemists have discovered that organisms as far apart as bacteria and humans use pretty similar biochemical mechanisms to monitor their environment.","gene-dead","10:12 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","20"

And since its an emergent property you are not likely to ""put it in a box"". Well you have to start by realizing that the soul is nothing more than a metaphysical construct unless of course you can measure it or put it in a box.

The brain is more than a metaphysical position! But OK, science doesn't have units of consciousness or anything along those lines to work with. It's still pretty much an intangible, but science deals with lots of intangibles.

Its like we know the car, all its mechanisms and functions, but not the driver and why he is going where he is going. it depends on how you see consciousness, I tend to see it as a particular quality or energy that life tunes in to to variyng degrees. Not as something produced by brain cells as you take for granted. this is just one theory out of many, based on several preconceptions (ie all life can be explained via physicochemical mechanisms, consciousness is produced by the brain) The problem remains: as consciousness just ""emerges"" magically without any known mechanism my view is just as valid. I tend to value personal experience more than scientific theories. Unlike you i dont base my metaphysical beliefs (if i have any, i am more of a total agnostic) on grand theories supported by scant empiri. If there are vital enegies (and from my experience there is) they are most certainly compatible with physics and chemistry, they are just not dicovered yet in the lab.

You are born with the seed of a soul, so it doesnt become a concrete presence until you ""cultivate it"".

There are many things that are real that I can't demonstrate to you or have you share in the experience. My enjoyment at eating ice cream, my pleasure at seeing a sunset, the fact that I scratched my knee just now. Just because you can't demonstrate that something exists does not automatically make it not real. On the other hand, if you can't demonstrate that something exists then you should by no means expect others to just take your word that it does.","gene-dead","02:49 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","30"
