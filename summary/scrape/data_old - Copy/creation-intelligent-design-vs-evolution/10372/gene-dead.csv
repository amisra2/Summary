It's pretty clear that everything science thought it knew about genes is false. Genes do not work in isolation. They do not perform only one function or code only one protein. Heck, the concept of the ""gene"" is being shattered. Science has so consumed itself looking at genes (or what they thought were genes) for the past century that they have lost sight of the fact that the genome is a functional unit, and cannot be broken apart and analyzed in bits and pieces without considering the context of the organism. And up until just a few years ago scientists thought there were over 100,000 genes in the genome -- now we know there are less than 25,000...but they still don't exactly how many! Does that give anyone else confidence that these guys have a freaking clue if they don't even know how many there are? http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20070908/bob9.asp The gene is dead ""The same sequences are being used for multiple functions,"" says Thomas R. Gingeras of Affymetrix. That introduces complications into the evolution of the genome, which had until recently been assumed to act through single DNA mutations affecting single genes. Now, ""a mutation in one of those sequences has to be interpreted not only in terms of [one gene], but [of] all the other transcripts going through the region,"" Gingeras explains More fundamentally, it muddies scientists' conception of just what constitutes a gene . In the established definition, a gene is a discrete region of DNA that produces a single, identifiable protein in a cell. But the functioning of a protein often depends on a host of RNAs that control its activity. If a stretch of DNA known to be a protein-coding gene also produces regulatory RNAs essential for several other genes, is it somehow a part of all those other genes as well? To make things even messier, the genetic code for a protein can be scattered far and wide around the genome. The ENCODE project revealed that about 90 percent of protein-coding genes possessed previously unknown coding fragments that were located far from the main gene, sometimes on other chromosomes. Many scientists now argue that this overlapping and dispersal of genes, along with the swelling ranks of functional RNAs, renders the standard gene concept of the central dogma obsolete . Long live the gene Offering a radical new conception of the genome, Gingeras proposes shifting the focus away from protein-coding genes. Instead, he suggests that the fundamental units of the genome could be defined as functional RNA transcripts. Since some of these transcripts ferry code for proteins as dutiful mRNAs, this new perspective would encompass traditional genes. But it would also accommodate new classes of functional RNAs as they're discovered, while avoiding the confusion caused by several overlapping genes laying claim to a single stretch of DNA. The emerging picture of the genome ""definitely shifts the emphasis from genes to transcr ipts ,"" agrees Mark B. Gerstein, a bioinformaticist at Yale University. Scientists' definition of a gene has evolved several times since Gregor Mendel first deduced the idea in the 1860s from his work with pea plants. Now, about 50 years after its last major revision, the gene concept is once again being called into question. The funny thing about all this, and the oh-so-ironic thing is this: what is the ONE thing that darwinists have always pointed to to show evidence of materialism -- evidence that we're merely an assortment of ""things?"" It's the GENE! And now -- of all things -- it's the gene that seems to have no physical reality!

Biochemists have reconstituted many individual parts of living systems in the test-tube, up to the replication of DNA and the transcription and translation of genes. So no, there isn't any particular mystery about what makes life different from non-life. We understand the biochemistry of it pretty well. Here you skip from ""life"" to ""consciousness"". The initial question was about the telling the difference between living and non-living systems. The answer to that is known: it's chemistry. Some chemistries allow for metabolism, replication and evolution... most do not, but they are all different aspects of chemistry. Not all life, my friend, is conscious. Plants, viruses and bacteria are alive, but few would argue, today, that they are conscious. Now, you ask, how does chemistry account for consciousness? Well, it doesn't as yet. So far as we know, consciousness is what they call an emergent property of the physicochemical system of the brain. What's an ""emergent property""? It's a phenomenon we know has physical reality based on some material phenomenon, but which we do not yet understand. We know that many animal brains result in consciousness. We know that brains are physicochemical machines. We understand some things about how they work. We know that physical (a cosh) or chemical (drugs) disruption of the machine disrupts consciousness, but we don't know yet how the machine generates consciousness. So we don't know everything. That is hardly reason to appeal to some miraculous and vitalistic forces. This is no more than the usual appeal to the God of the Gaps, where every gap in physical knowledge is presumed to be filled by a divine miracle. Doesn't make scientific sense. besides, the gaps keep getting filled in with science. What are you going to do when science explains consciousness, eh?

"09-13-2007","10372",2,"jim's trucking","283681","Notwithstanding my ineptness in this field...alas, I am but a lowly electrical engineer...I anticipate being shown to be mistaken. Based on one scientific observation pointed out to me in an article written by someone who apparently knows what he's doing, I contend that a brainless animal such as a jelly fish can be chemically conscious of delectible morsels suspended in nearby ocean water and can send out its tentacles to retreave said food. Somehow, the brainless jelly fish ""knows"" the food is there. It's conscious of the presense of food. I believe it smells with chemically induced stimuli. Main Entry: consciousness Listen to the pronunciation of consciousness Pronunciation: \-ns\ Function: noun Date: 1629 1 a: the quality or state of being aware especially of something within oneself b: the state or fact of being conscious of an external object, state, or fact c: awareness; especially : concern for some social or political cause2: the state of being characterized by sensation, emotion, volition, and thought : mind3: the totality of conscious states of an individual4: the normal state of conscious life <regained consciousness>5: the upper level of mental life of which the person is aware as contrasted with unconscious processes The body of an adult jellyfish consists of a bell shape producing jelly and enclosing its internal structure, from which tentacles are suspended. Each tentacle is covered with cells called cnidocytes, that can sting or kill other animals. Most jellyfish use these cells to secure prey or for defense. Others, such as Rhizostomae, do not have tentacles at all. Jellyfish lack basic sensory organs and a brain, but their nervous systems and rhopalia allow them to perceive stimuli, such as light and odor, and respond quickly. They feed on small fish and zooplankton that become caught in their tentacles. Most jellyfish are passive drifters and slow swimmers, as their shape is not hydrodynamic. Instead, they move so as to create a current forcing the prey within reach of their tentacles. They do this by rhythmically opening and closing their bell-like body. Their digestive system is incomplete: the same orifice is used to take in food and expel waste. A jellyfish detects the touch of other animals using a nervous system called a ""nerve net"", found in its epidermis. Touch stimuli are collected by nerve rings, through the rhopalial lappet located around the animal's body, to the nerve cells. Jellyfish also have ocelli that cannot form images but are sensitive to light; the jellyfish can use these to determine up from down, basing its judgement on sunlight shining on the surface of the water.","chemist99a","283684","I don't think consscious and having an ablity to sense and respond are equivalent. I suppose its debatable to some extent, but the dictionary definition is not quite aligned with aware in the sense of chemosensory driven responses in a jelly fish. And the jelly fish is not wiithout a nervous system you know. In contrast a plant such as a sunflower will track the sun - its strictly chemical and the mechanisms are well known. Would you consider that to be conscious behavior? Most would not as its a tropism which is fully automatic and the sunflower has no nervous system at all. As to jellyfish specifically lets just pull quote from WIKI.\ Anatomy and morphology","gene-dead","09:48 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","19"

All organisms track changes in their environment physicochemically, and respond appropriately. Even a bacterium has chemoreceptors that tell it what sort of environment it's in. Some bacteria are even able to sense magnetic fields using microscopic crystals of magnetite. Many animals navigate in part using similar magnetic sensors. Organisms have to be sensitive to -- if you prefer, conscious of -- their environment. Of course, you might reply that sensitivity to and consciousness of are not quite the same things, and I wouldn't disagree. Biologists can't give you the answer to every interesting question; if they could, they'd be out of a job. However, biochemists have discovered that organisms as far apart as bacteria and humans use pretty similar biochemical mechanisms to monitor their environment.","gene-dead","10:12 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","20"

Since I don't believe in the ""spiritual"", I have no idea what you may mean. As far as ""pollution"" I'd say that is in the eye of the beholder. Generally I think that the human condition remains more or less constant regardless of historical period.","martinlb","283733","Bookshops are full of books of spirituality etc, most of it is watered out, new agey stuff. So spiritual is itself a watered out term. What i am talking about has to do with ""being"", a strong, inner sense of existing and being connected with everything. I am not talking about believing before seeing. rather the opposite. One of the initial steps in most spiritual paths is to empty and still the mind, no thougths, no daydreams, no movement, no ideas about what might happen and so on. And do it for hours. This is extraordinary hard, and require a huge effort. And you cant even be sure to attain results. So one has to accept that kind of insecurity. And most people who practice these sorts of things today never get past this initial step. Of course this has very little appeal with most people today who want the easy way out with instant gratification. As regards your comment about the human condition... it woudnt do you bad to study a little history. Go a few centuries back and you have no tvs, phones, cars, advertisement (at least not like we see today), stereos etc. All these things produce impressons that are mostly not useful, not wanted, and fill up the mind where they have be ""digested"".

I regard matter as derivative from consciousness. We cannot get behind consciousness. Everything that we talk about, everything that we regard as existing, postulates consciousness."" The Observer, London, January 25, 1931 Werner Heisenberg ""The common division of the world into subject and object, inner world and outer world, body and soul is no longer adequate."" Erwin Schroedinger ""Subject and object are only one. The barrier between them cannot be said to have broken down as a result of recent experiments in the physical sciences, for this barrier does not exist"". Schrodinger (1961) claims that the Vedic slogan All in One and One in All was an idea that led him to the creation of quantum mechanics. ""Consciousness is never experienced in the plural, only in the singular. How does the idea of plurality (emphatically opposed by the Upanishad writers) arise at all? ... the only possible alternative is simply to keep the immediate experience that consciousness is a singular of which the plural is unknown; that there *is* only one thing and that what seems to be a plurality is merely a series of different aspects of this one thing produced by deception (the Indian maya) - in much the same way Gaurisankar and Mt. Everest turn out to be the same peak seen from different valleys."" (From: What is Life)","gene-dead","05:35 PM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","42"

Indeed I have and do spend time away from civilization albeit less nowadays as I have very young children. I do know what you mean but civilization has presented the distractions we know today in different forms for millenia.

I know it in the same way I know the earth orbits the sun, or that humans and chimps had a more recent common ancestor than either did with horses or cheetahs. I suppose you could argue that such knowledge is ""only"" a subjective belief because the knowledge is not reality itself, it's like Plato's shadows in a cave, a mere reflection of reality. I suppose you could argue that, but I don't think it's a productive line to take. If reality didn't correspond to our mental projections of it, we would very rapidly come to grief, so there has to be some correspondence between what we believe (or know, or think we know) is real, and reality itself. And as someone once pointed out, the only thing to do with the Ultimate Skeptic who doubts the reality of everything is to ignore him! As to my feeling freedom or serenity in my soul, that depends on what you mean by soul. To me, a soul is the motion of electrical charges in a brain across interconnected networks of cells. The feelings are perfectly real, and given a fMRI machine or something of the sort, could probably even be tracked as they occur. They are as real as ripples on a lake... or the far side of the moon","gene-dead","04:07 AM","creation-intelligent-design-vs-evolution","46"
