The point pro-lifers (the rational ones) make is that pain and cognition are not the values which needs to be protected life is, human life; and the value of human life is inseparable from the potential of that life. If you kill a man when he's thirty all you have destroyed is his potential life after that point. All he did and was before then remains inviolate. If it's not a real value you destroyed then whats the problem? The point is that the principle we act on in general is that you do not harm human life regardless of what temporary and arbitrary values you place on it. As a homosexual advocate might say 'only difference is genitals' I say the only difference is age. You may content yourself with your arbitrary identification of the thalmo cortical complex as the signifier of rights, but it obviously does not produce a functioning adult human. There is vast development left, and you are ultimately still drawing a line in the sand.

The influence that the trade union movement had on British politics( both Labour and Conservative governments) gave the Trotskyite and Workers revolutionary factions power far beyond what their low numbers should have done. The extreme political leanings of union officials ultimately made Britain a manufacturing basket case . While the Japanese exported good quality cars to us our cars manufacturers were striking over tea breaks and producing ' Friday afternoon' lemons..to name just one unionised industry.So I agree with you that politics and labour do not mix. Ive seen the best of union activity and maybe not the worst but some aspects of my own union that I am not proud of ..to say the least. America has more extremes and more extremists than the UK. IMO much of the dynamism of American thought and action comes from the lack of social care in US society.. plus( believe it or not) gun ownership.

Conservatives believe that the original structure of America's carefully written constitution and its enduring framework of limited government is the best mechanism for securing national independence, providing economic opportunity, establishing religious liberty, and maintaining a flourishing society of republican self-government. Conservatives believe that the change we need, the change that is consistent with the American idea, is not movement away from but toward our principleswhich are both the fixed goal and the unchanging ground of our ever-changing experience. There are, of course, a wide variety of groups and movements within the conservative movement itself. Some are primarily focused on strengthening our national defense, others are concerned primarily with social issues, and still others are driven primarily to advance economic freedom.

The tombstone marking the grave of Adolf Hitler's parents in Austria has been removed, officials say, to end its use as a pilgrimage site for right-wing extremists. The German Workers' Party, the forerunner of the Nazi Party, espoused a right-wing ideology, like many similar groups of demobilized soldiers. Adolf Hitler joined this small political party in 1919 and rose to leadership through his emotional and captivating speeches. He encouraged national pride, militarism, and a commitment to the Volk and a racially ""pure"" Germany. German Workers' Party : As the precursor to the Nazi Party, Hitler joined the right-wing Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (DAP) in 1919. The party espoused national pride, militarism, a commitment to the Volk, and a racially ""pure"" Germany. His [Himmlers] military ambitions thwarted by the Versailles treaty, Himmler instead turned to politics, becoming increasingly involved with various right wing nationalist paramilitaries and political parties; this eventually led him to join Ernst Rhm's SA (Sturmabteilung) and the National Socialist Party. Himmler gradually turned his back on Catholicism and his parents' more traditional brand of nationalism, becoming increasingly indoctrinated into the anti-Communist, anti-Semitic party line.","jet57","454896","Well, first of all, citing the heritage foundation's definition of conservatism is like citing Joseph Goebbels definition of National Socialism; you know that don't you . . .

"05-14-2012","16187",4,"Freedom","454930","I am aware that many suffer from the same delusions you do. Notice the "" worker's party"" precursor to the national socialist party. So define it please. In April, 1920, Hitler advocated that the party should change its name to the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP). Hitler had always been hostile to socialist ideas, especially those that involved racial or sexual equality. However, socialism was a popular political philosophy in Germany after the First World War. This was reflected in the growth in the German Social Democrat Party (SDP), the largest political party in Germany. Hitler, therefore redefined socialism by placing the word 'National' before it. He claimed he was only in favour of equality for those who had ""German blood"". Jews and other ""aliens"" would lose their rights of citizenship, and immigration of non-Germans should be brought to an end. In September 1919, Hitler visited, as a V-Man, a meeting of the German Workers' Party. The party name indicated that it had socialist leanings with its ""workers'"" tag. It was, in fact, an extreme, anti-Semitic, anti-communist, right wing nationalist party lead by Karl Drexler. At Hitler's visit, it only had 40 members. Hitler informed the army that it posed no threat to Germany. After this visit, Hitler joined the party as it seemed to represent all that he believed in. He quickly became the party's propaganda officer. In early 1920, the party changed its name to the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) which quickly got corrupted to 'Nazi' by both enemies and supporters alike. Hitler wrote out the party's beliefs in the so-called 25 Point Party Programme. This party programme was a curious mixture - right wing nationalism; anti-capitalism; anti-socialism; anti-wealth etc.","jet57","455074","Uh, no; people are not under any delusions about the right-wing. People are wise to whats going on. The Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei: National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP). The party was formed in 1919 by nationalist ex military men, one of whom was Ernst Rhome who militarized the party and was one of two who recruited Hitler strictly because of his oratory skills. Socialism was extremely popular in Europe with the fall of empire. Adolf Hitler allowed the word socialist to stay in the workers party as a come on to get people to sign on. Heres more: Nazi Party (NSDAP) Adolf Hitler 1918 to 1924 Hitler targeted; socialists, communists, unionists, freemasons; anybody or any group that was outside his revised nazi party. The very reason for Auschwitz concentration camp in 1933 was for a place to put these political prisoners in the first place. Having said that, I dont claim that todays right-wing are Nazis; I claim that todays right-wing are using the very same techniques, both in actual practice and their media. One great example is this business by the right-of real Americans; Hitler and the SS espoused the true German. If you werent a true German, you were less than, you were a traitor; you couldnt marry . . . etc etc. Knomb Chomsky said it very clearly as well: todays right-wing media is very much the same as 1933 Germany: you just have to know what youre looking for.

ABSTRACT: In the post 9-11 world, terrorism has been primarily associated with the external threat from radical Islamic extremists. Prior to September 11, 2001 the single most destructive weapon of mass destruction in the United States was the Ryder truck bomb built by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. Both McVeigh and Nichols harbored extreme right-wing anti-government beliefs they felt justified the bombing. A high level of anti-American government sentiment was a common element shared by McVeigh, Nichols, and the al Qaeda terrorists on the 9-11 aircraft. This article asks if the threat of violence by right-wing extremists, including their possible deployment of weapons of mass destruction, has been neutralized. Information to better understand the level of threat posed by right-wing groups includes the need to understand their ideology and history, along with a review of past and present individuals who influenced the growth and development of the radical right, including the following groups: Christian Identity; militias; Sovereign Citizens, Freemen, and Common Law Courts; Ku Klux Klan; neo-Nazis; and Skinheads. Central to the agenda is white supremacism, preservation of individual wealth in a setting of free market capitalism, preservation of rigidly traditional religious and family structures, and defense of US military hegemony. There is virtually universal agreement that para-military white supremacists or neo-Nazis are right wing. More subtle distinctions are required when right-wing groups operate within mainstream US culture.","jet57","455167","The right-wing in this country has been shown to be dangerously nationalist, they exercise a belligerent and chauvinistic foreign policy based more on manifest destiny than anything else.

Liberal Fundamentalism Theres a particularly pernicious brand of fundamentalism making the rounds in America today liberal fundamentalism. Liberal Fundamentalism is a failed and destructive philosophical enterprise, replete with a host of anti-Biblical, pseudo-religious doctrines that seeks to elevate the ways and wisdom of man above the wisdom and desires of God. Its principle aim is the sacking of traditional Judaic and Christian values and beliefs, which are revisited through suspect liberal scholarship or politically-correct dogma in an effort to replace them with the tenets of carnal moral hedonism and the failed social doctrines of todays liberal elitists. The genesis of todays liberal fundamentalists was the anti-traditionalist hedonists of the 1960's and 70's. They advocated fornication and free-love, illegal substance abuse, moral relativism, contempt for authority, and they enjoyed a prosperous America founded on the very hard work and enterprise they sought to distance themselves from. The freedoms they enjoyed were purchased by the blood, sweat and personal sacrifices of the very forefathers they held in contempt. Personal responsibility, self-restraint and self-sacrifice are often foreign concepts to them. Right and wrong, and good and evil were arbitrarily revisited, for such concepts had no objective meaning to them. They had no objective rationality for their hedonistic philosophy other than if it feels good, lets do it.

Thank you, University of Colorado Board Votes to Fire Embattled Professor Ward Churchill | Fox News Ward Churchill. One of the most revered mantras of liberal fundamentalism is equality. The net effect of this experiment, in many instances, was to elevate women via the degradation of men, promote racial equality by instituting race-based preferences and reverse discrimination, engender class warfare against people of means via their socialistic redistribution of wealth schemes (a concept centered in greed for other peoples money, rather than relying on ones own personal initiative and work ethic), and elevate wickedness (sodomy, fornication, pornography, and other ungodly issues) to the plateau of respectability at the expense of traditional Godly values. Along with the failed liberal concept of equality was the mantra of liberal tolerance. However, liberal tolerance is not what it appears to be. It is a contradictory, partisan philosophical perspective with its own rigid set of dogmas. It assumes, for instance, a relativistic view of moral and religious knowledge. This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality, abortion rights, and religious truth claims, leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs. But this posture is often dogmatic, intolerant, and coercive, for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues, and if one does not embrace it, one may likely face public ridicule, demagogic tactics, and perhaps even legal reprisals. Liberal tolerance is therefore neither liberal nor tolerant. Rather than truly embrace freedom, liberal fundamentalists seek to control virtually every aspect of the lives of the masses that are unfortunate enough to be under their fundamentalist rulership. They seek to outlaw SUVs, impose smoking bans while advocating marijuana use, prohibit freedom of religious expression in government and public schools, advocate compulsory training in politically correct opinions and attitudes, seek to enforce Bible bans in schools and the workplace, embrace a de-facto litmus test against pro-life judicial nominees, tell people what and where they can eat, seek to criminalize pro-life demonstrations through the RICO racketeering statute, try to squelch legitimate religious speech via hate-speech laws (note Canada), and generally engage in a wide range of behaviors designed to subvert the U.S. Constitution and traditional American values. It is certainly evident, then, that progressive liberal fundamentalism substantially undermines the basic effectiveness of the government and other societal elements of democracy. Despite the idealistic goals of liberalism, attempts to build a utopian liberal society in America have only led to heightened outbreaks of AIDS, VD, porno-related crime, social divisions, divorce, abortion, drug addictions, deficit spending, the welfare state, a crushing tax burden, the breakdown of the family unit, moral depravity, and numerous other such scourges which have resulted in enormous societal suffering and discontent. As a result, liberal fundamentalism is strongly associated with left-wing fanaticism, reverse-racism, anti-intellectualism, elitism, nihilism, godlessness, and societal violence.

The models by which they both operated were polls apart: Stalin operated on the communist ideal, which is socialism to the third power: in theory . Hitler on the otherhand, began his campaign with totalitarianism in mind. He remodeled the word ""socialist"" in his own image of ""Germany"" rather than an egalitarian social construct. Socialism became very very popular following WWI and the end of empire. Communism was not popular, but its ""equality"" ideal was what people were looking for, and equality for all was well known as an American ideal. But America and England had beat Germany, so Hitler went with protectionsim to inth degree, using the concept of socialism as a come on for requitment and acceptance of his policies: it worked. Now, the reason I left my qualification statement open was for the purpose of inviting a comment to see where it went . . . One of things I try very hard not to do , is label right-wngers nazis, as such. The right-wing polices and propoganda however are a very different matter . . . Those techniques and policies almost mirror the build up of Hitler's totalitatian regime and exactly how that build up worked; through extreme nationalism, ""the real American"" and ""the real German"", vitimization of some unseen power, the aim of which was to destroy ""the father land"", ""the mother land, and now of course the very fabric of ""the Home land"" (more and more accepted euphemism, used almost exclusicvely by the right). To Hitler, it was the Jew "", to right-wing Americans it was the communists in the 50s and 60s and the beast (I use the word advisedly) has just been shifted over time into the liberal ; the ""socialist"". The parallels are remarkable. What's frightening about it, is that the right-wing has taken the notion of radio as a propoganda tool in the 60s to outright owning networks; like Bain and Fox, and intentionally misleading and using an incendiary diatribe has become an almost acceptable form of media under the consistent guise of ""free speech"" . When one crossreferenes the two campaigns, one sees it very plainly. The communists however, were successful because they had a demonstrable and empirical adversary that was backed by a thesis that was equally demonstrable. That is to say, the communist adversary was not a ghost . . . Throughout human history we see examples of this type of undermining and take over of various societies. The radical right in this country is very well funded and has been using corporate domestic and foreign policies to develope their cashe; which is the very definition of fascism.","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","05:30 PM","abortion-debates","64"

Hitlers propaganda prior to that time appealed especially to farmers and working people: he roused people to support him and then subverted the entire country by supplanting the government with Nazis and controlling the social structure with a Chinese box of secret police forces.

Both leaders had their murder histories; Stalin killed more people than Hitler, but both holocausts happened from entirely different perspectives.

It's the difference between a protestor that advocates anarchy and someone that shoots policemen. Because they did not have military force, their collectives dissolved quickly. If they had been much larger, and the dictates of the leaders were enforced with guns it would be a nation with taxes. This is incorrect, an ideology is not necessarily emotional or irrational, nor is philosophy necessarily rational and pragmatic and certainly it is not concerned only with the current state of affairs. See ethics. Why did Hitler think they were then? You have some nerve lecturing me on historical knowledge shortly after you confused WW1 with the Napoleonic wars, and couldn't tell the difference between russian and french armies. If you don't think the USSR was a bloody ruin, you need to read the writings of some middle-old age Russians. If you kill more people than the Nazi's and your economy collapses even though you can command people to work; you are a bloody ruin. I see so you completely ignored my request and thus nullified the point I was trying to make... or did you? The point I was trying to make is that it was an explicit philosophical statement about an ideal, and that from the statement alone it was impossible to tell whether a fascist or a communist said it. By looking it up you admit by implication that you could not tell. Oh no, you're much to clever, you saw the danger involved in guessing who said it so you didn't guess.

Socialism can be rightly seen as based on a single axiom found throughout socialist philosophy. This axiom is; the good of the group outweighs the rights of the individual. Karl Marx said, If we have chosen the position in life in which we can most of all work for mankind, no burdens can bow us down, because they are sacrifices for the benefit of all; then we shall experience no petty, limited, selfish joy, but our happiness will belong to millions, our deeds will live on quietly but perpetually at work, and over our ashes will be shed the hot tears of noble people. Socialism is simply the formalization of tribalism. In every case it has become prevalent, it has centered on charismatic chieftains that preach about the greater good. Socialism is the dominance of the individual for the good of the group. The day of individual happiness has passed. By this Hitler means that in the new era, the new world he hoped to create, happiness would be nationalized. In his Germany, the German people would be as one organism. Hitlers version of nationalism sought to preserve and expand on the ideals of Germanys past namely: obedience, duty, and strength. Thus Nazi Nationalism is unique because of the nature of Germany. This brand of nationalism was intensely communal, it sought to create a unified German person, a body of people whose goals were the same, and strove for them together. To achieve this he cultivated a sense of public ownership of everything, even if this ownership was de facto, instead of de jure. Property was only lent to individuals, so that they could develop for the German Collective. Groups of all kind were developed to unify and homogenize. Nationalism is different for every nation because the character of every nation is different. The American right glorifies the nation that saved millions in Soviet Russia from starvation, liberated Europe from oppresive tyranny, and created the first society based on the ideals of classical liberals like John Locke. Conservatives are trying to preserve a culture whose spread and acceptance has brought relative peace and prosperity to huge swaths of earth. Where ever it has been quashed and betrayed misery and poverty have taken hold. In essence, Conservatism represents the founding principles. Mark Levin. These principles of life and liberty are the basis of the American right. This vision of nationalism is fundamentally different from Nazi Nationalism.","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","02:53 PM","abortion-debates","121"
"07-25-2012","16187",9,"None","None","None","humanrights4us","459928","Hello All I am a new member here, I actually joined to ask some questions to the pro gay rights advocates however I cannot resist a good debate so here I am. I actually read the article in the medical ethics journal I believe the title was ""After Birth Abortion - Why Should The Baby Live?"" The first thing that struck me about the article was the heading ""after birth abortion"" now this is clearly an oxymoron as abortion can only take place while the fetus is in utero. The title should have read ""Infancide - Why should the baby live?"" though the debate on the subject of infantcide is not new and people have expressed their negative discernment to this subject many times, however pro infantcide advocates repeadily attempt to dress up their arguments in different ways. Sadly in America I believe that this is actually being considered and there is information available to suggest President Obhama voted in favour of this. There are also references in the bible in favour of infantcide. Going back to the medical ethics publication published earlier this year which I am assuming the telegraph based their article on, the argument there was that a new born was a non person for various reasons. As already pointed out in this thread there is a substantial difference between a child in utero and an infant whos ambilical cord has been cut. The main difference being the fetus in utero is dependent on the host, if the host dies unless a medical operation is carried out the fetus will also perish. A fetus in utero is reliant on the host for survival, where as once born if the mother was to die the baby would still survive providing someone fed the baby a substitute to the mothers milk and took over the mothers role. Also the article calls a newborn baby a non person, this is an important part of their argument as they suggest a non person can not be harmed.

"09-06-2012","16187",9,"humanrights4us","459928","Hello All I am a new member here, I actually joined to ask some questions to the pro gay rights advocates however I cannot resist a good debate so here I am. I actually read the article in the medical ethics journal I believe the title was ""After Birth Abortion - Why Should The Baby Live?"" The first thing that struck me about the article was the heading ""after birth abortion"" now this is clearly an oxymoron as abortion can only take place while the fetus is in utero. The title should have read ""Infancide - Why should the baby live?"" though the debate on the subject of infantcide is not new and people have expressed their negative discernment to this subject many times, however pro infantcide advocates repeadily attempt to dress up their arguments in different ways. Sadly in America I believe that this is actually being considered and there is information available to suggest President Obhama voted in favour of this. There are also references in the bible in favour of infantcide. Going back to the medical ethics publication published earlier this year which I am assuming the telegraph based their article on, the argument there was that a new born was a non person for various reasons. As already pointed out in this thread there is a substantial difference between a child in utero and an infant whos ambilical cord has been cut. The main difference being the fetus in utero is dependent on the host, if the host dies unless a medical operation is carried out the fetus will also perish. A fetus in utero is reliant on the host for survival, where as once born if the mother was to die the baby would still survive providing someone fed the baby a substitute to the mothers milk and took over the mothers role. Also the article calls a newborn baby a non person, this is an important part of their argument as they suggest a non person can not be harmed. It is complete nonsense to suggest that a baby is non person as they do indeed have expectations, they may not have aspirations just now such as in long term life goals however they do have basic expectations for example they expect to be fed and soothed on demand. Also the article suggesting that an infant having the staus of a non person cannot suffer harm has dangerous implications as how can we protect an infant from harm or abuse when it is being proposed that they are non persons and cannot suffer harm.

Sure there were plenty of babies out of wedlock, but way way way less than there would be today if 50 million hadn't been killed before birth.

Simply telling someone to think about it now because it will be a bad situation if it happens does discourage it to happen. The reason it is a bad situation is because it is murder to kill your children so you are stuck with 9 months of pregnancy and would be stuck with even more if there were no orphanages. It sure has for the people who are throwing out the bath water because there is a baby in it. The demographic, you mean people started to have more abortions before it became legal? So wouldn't legalizing it then by validating the trend towards irresponsible behavior? Except in the case of rape, yes. And since the procedure requires who consent as well, the abortion is in every case. Revisionist history, women's rights may not have been ideal; but rape has always been considered an abomination by every civilization. Those societies which placed strong pressures on women to make themselves available (like prearranged marriages) also gave them full social support in taking care of any children. Yea, humiliating in the frame work of marriages being the only proper place for sex and kids. It worked in 19th century America, and I'd gladly use that as a model for sexual behavior that could produce children. No, getting married later is the solution; the one requiring marriage leads to. Then what's changed or are you one of those nut cases who thinks nothing's changed we just know about it now? No, the stigma attached to runaway fathers is as old as that attached to bastards, adulterers, and women getting pregnant out of wedlock. In many places the girls family would hold you to responsibility through force. I know the trend to wait for marriage is new, because you don't need marriage to bang each other anymore; and that's the problem. Marriage is functionally the acceptance of a possible family, and sex is making a family possible. Sex before marriage is risking an event before accepting it as a possible consequence. That is why people are freaking out and getting abortions, they were just in it for a good time; they don't want a family, often the family cannot even be constructed. The point of marriage was so that children didn't come into the world with no hope of a healthy family support being insufficiently cared for by someone who thinks of them as the thing that ruined their life.... and pro-deathers have the audacity to claim that this tragedy is why abortion is necessary. I really believe that if you take murdering your neighbor off the table, peaceful neighborhoods would 'somehow' take hold. I personally don't care if a generation does have to reinvent the wheel and learn the hard way to not have sex until your ready to have kids. When they do learn they will teach it to their kids, and presto conservative values take hold. I think it is to a large degree. If you were taking a test, and the professor places a card with all the answers on your desk. They tell you, that you can look at it as a last resort. You get stuck on a problem and ask if there is any penalty for looking at the answers. They then assure you that it's not your fault. They say that since you are stuck and there is not enough time left for you to get the answer on your own, telling you to study is just making a bad problem worse; and it wouldn't do to get bad grades. So you look at the card and you might feel bad about cheating for a while, but you get over it because as everyone keeps telling you; you are the victim. If I made this policy at a school do you think studying would go up or down? Just because I know you have particular difficulty with any and all analogies I will break it down for you. Studying on your own is using contraceptives, a good chance of working but not perfect. The cheat sheet the professor gives you is abortion. Only having sex after marriage is like bringing the book to the test and having 24 hours to complete the test.... studying means you won't have to stay as long, but even if you do it's alright. Don't tell me people ignore it as an option, and don't tell me options don't affect people's decisions. Roe v Wade effectively made it so that if any mother does not want to take responsibility for their offspring they do not have to. No such guarantee for fathers though :o Such as promiscuous sex? Any theories besides the cons got smaller? Nor has it been divorced from the production of children until recently in the delusions of young people. Very few people are cannibals, you could say society is at a point where that's just not a danger; but it doesn't really follow that we only outlaw things that aren't happening does it? It is unacceptable to wait until no one wants to kill their children just as it would be unacceptable to wait until no one wants to eat other people. You outlaw it and if the temptation goes away all the better. ... will be telling the truth? Yes. I don't need to take their word, I just charge them if they are negligent with their children. What are you trying to say? That people can't control themselves? The desire is not going to go away, but if you really cannot find any other way to release other than acts which may produce children then you should be ready to take care of children. Thinking of yourself as the inevitable minion of ancient imperatives is a sure way to erode self-control about sex. I am not religious and this is not about limiting earthly pleasure, but it is an objective fact that condoms and pills do not work 100% of the time; just as it is an objective fact that you are killing your offspring if you have an abortion. Anyone who thinks regular homicide is the price of pleasure and intimacy has a serious miscalculation of values. If we want to have sex all the time without getting married that would actually be the best strategy. Not kids at birth of course, whenever they want to start having sex you collect and store enough gametes so that if and when they want kids they have the material then you sterilize them so they can go off and have as many consequence-less orgies as they want. Realizing the truth is perfect. Birth control is imperfect and so it should never be used where full term pregnancy is absolutely unacceptable. Outlawing abortion will fix the abortion problem.","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","02:24 AM","abortion-debates","144"

If you are willing to simply assume animals are worthy of rights how much more so should you assume the same thing for different individuals of a species known to have rights? Why do people think that they can stick their hand in the proverbial hat and pull out some chemical (metacognition ) or structure (thalamo-cortical complex) and decide ""Yes this is what gives you rights""? The premise there is clear, that you judge another human individuals mental traits to decide whether you are going to treat them like a lower life form or not. It is not necessary to say every human is as worthy as every other, or claim that 20 seconds after conception a fetus is a little Mozart.

The reason it is a bad situation is because it is murder to kill your children so you are stuck with 9 months of pregnancy and would be stuck with even more if there were no orphanages. It sure has for the people who are throwing out the bath water because there is a baby in it. Except in the case of rape, yes. And since the procedure requires who consent as well, the abortion is in every case. Revisionist history, women's rights may not have been ideal; but rape has always been considered an abomination by every civilization. Those societies which placed strong pressures on women to make themselves available (like prearranged marriages) also gave them full social support in taking care of any children. Yea, humiliating in the frame work of marriages being the only proper place for sex and kids. It worked in 19th century America, and I'd gladly use that as a model for sexual behavior that could produce children. No, getting married later is the solution; the one requiring marriage leads to. Then what's changed or are you one of those nut cases who thinks nothing's changed we just know about it now? No, the stigma attached to runaway fathers is as old as that attached to bastards, adulterers, and women getting pregnant out of wedlock. In many places the girls family would hold you to responsibility through force. I know the trend to wait for marriage is new, because you don't need marriage to bang each other anymore; and that's the problem. Marriage is functionally the acceptance of a possible family, and sex is making a family possible. Sex before marriage is risking an event before accepting it as a possible consequence. That is why people are freaking out and getting abortions, they were just in it for a good time; they don't want a family, often the family cannot even be constructed. The point of marriage was so that children didn't come into the world with no hope of a healthy family support being insufficiently cared for by someone who thinks of them as the thing that ruined their life. ... and pro-deathers have the audacity to claim that this tragedy is why abortion is necessary. I really believe that if you take murdering your neighbor off the table, peaceful neighborhoods would 'somehow' take hold. I personally don't care if a generation does have to reinvent the wheel and learn the hard way to not have sex until your ready to have kids. When they do learn they will teach it to their kids, and presto conservative values take hold. I think it is to a large degree. If you were taking a test, and the professor places a card with all the answers on your desk. They tell you, that you can look at it as a last resort. You get stuck on a problem and ask if there is any penalty for looking at the answers. They then assure you that it's not your fault. They say that since you are stuck and there is not enough time left for you to get the answer on your own, telling you to study is just making a bad problem worse; and it wouldn't do to get bad grades. So you look at the card and you might feel bad about cheating for a while, but you get over it because as everyone keeps telling you; you are the victim. If I made this policy at a school do you think studying would go up or down? Just because I know you have particular difficulty with any and all analogies I will break it down for you. Studying on your own is using contraceptives, a good chance of working but not perfect. The cheat sheet the professor gives you is abortion. Only having sex after marriage is like bringing the book to the test and having 24 hours to complete the test.... studying means you won't have to stay as long, but even if you do it's alright. Don't tell me people ignore it as an option, and don't tell me options don't affect people's decisions. Roe v Wade effectively made it so that if any mother does not want to take responsibility for their offspring they do not have to. Very few people are cannibals, you could say society is at a point where that's just not a danger; but it doesn't really follow that we only outlaw things that aren't happening does it? It is unacceptable to wait until no one wants to kill their children just as it would be unacceptable to wait until no one wants to eat other people. You outlaw it and if the temptation goes away all the better. I don't need to take their word, I just charge them if they are negligent with their children. What are you trying to say? That people can't control themselves? The desire is not going to go away, but if you really cannot find any other way to release other than acts which may produce children then you should be ready to take care of children. Thinking of yourself as the inevitable minion of ancient imperatives is a sure way to erode self-control about sex. I am not religious and this is not about limiting earthly pleasure, but it is an objective fact that condoms and pills do not work 100% of the time; just as it is an objective fact that you are killing your offspring if you have an abortion. Anyone who thinks regular homicide is the price of pleasure and intimacy has a serious miscalculation of values. If we want to have sex all the time without getting married that would actually be the best strategy. Not kids at birth of course, whenever they want to start having sex you collect and store enough gametes so that if and when they want kids they have the material then you sterilize them so they can go off and have as many consequence-less orgies as they want.

Exception, you are kidding? Get your facts straight. To say it was viewed as an abomination and leave it at that is a gross misinterpretation of history. No they didn't. You missed the point entirely. Did it really? If you were to go back and have to live under those same conditions you would look for another example. And that is a rising trend, but it still does not provide for a solution for you. There are still plenty of couples who become pregnant having no desire to be parents. Parental participation in the raising of children. Those glory days of the 1800's saw a much larger segment of the population on farms and an even larger having a parent at home. Until school became mandatory and child labor laws kicked in kids were at home or at a job, but keep thinking its TV and video games. By all means keep blaming Donkey Kong and 90210 as the reason kids have been led astray. Deadbeat dads are a recent culture change in the US, The stigma of bastards is old, but you have to look at the reasoning behind that which undermines your first statement. That would be women adulters, men even today usually end up no worse off after a short period of time. Of course unwed mothers were looked down upon, the man well the double standard is not a myth That makes for good TV, but bad history. Well if it was only teenage girls it would be a problem, but it is not. You just took all the pleasure out of sex and turned it into nothing more than a reproductive process. Should the newlyweds who don't want a family until they spend a few years married avoid sex? That is not even close to what the point of marriage was. It has evolved into something that can resemble that, but it didn't start that way. Are tyrants any less audacious? That is a dream that will never happen. In every single instance conservative values have lasted a few years before their repressive nature drives people to liberal rebellion. You seem to think that every woman sees abortion as a means of birth control and that knowledge frees them to become far more promiscuous. There is an emotional penalty to your test and let's put more value on the results. If you don't pass there is a good chance you will live at or below the poverty line, you will struggle to provide for yourself and children, you will most likely face this alone and odds are good your child will lead the same disappointing life awaiting you. There is no retest and while you may have planned on taking the test you didn't think it would be today. I have problems with analogies that create favorable comparison by leaving out relevant aspects. Making the whole thing pointless not clever And how did it accomplish that? Are you suggesting that the government does have the right to invade a woman's privacy? That government does have the right to dictate what a person can and cannot do? But then if all those myths were true about eating dead people then it probably would be legal since it would serve a purpose for the benefit of society. So it really depends on hoe society benefits As soon as it is a child then be my guest, but not before. Wake up it is already eroded. Heck according to the Bible abstinence isn't even 100%. When the abortion is performed it is not someone's offspring. It must be born to be so. It is a collection of cells that have the potential to develop into a human over 9 months. Would you say it is murder to have a tapeworm removed? Its alive, it usually doesn't harm the host? It didn't intentionally invade it's host. It can't survive without the host? You seem to be willing to make exceptions, but how can you? Your argument is it is a human being that has a right to life and the mother is obligated to carry it to term. That it will be deformed or possibly kill the mother or is the product of rape or incest has no bearing. Even one step further why even permit birth control? The only difference between a potential person as you define it and an unfertilized egg is sperm. Both are potential human beings. Women should not be permitted to menstruate. They should constantly be pregnant and men can't be killing their contribution to the process either. That is the path your on. Do you have anything that is actually viable? Why don't we just say yapple dapple or use the Magic Eight Ball or even a time machine if she becomes pregnant she can go back and not have sex? Since at no time in the history of mankind has that happened, how about an alternative?

Birth control especially is just effective enough so that kids aren't worried and just ineffective enough that you still have an unacceptable number of unwanted pregnancies. A child is a cluster of cells. Maybe you didn't listen in school when they told you what your body is made up of. No No I don't think it is. Yes they did. Then clarify. Not for sexual responsibility. If they are absolutely unwilling to be parents then they should engage in absolutely no intercourse. If there is any chance of children they need to have a plan and it is not appropriate to plan on adoption or murder. Fascinating theory but it's kind of lacking a mechanism besides oversight. When parents sent their kids to boarding schools they weren't participating, but the boarding schools were strict and gender segregated; so there weren't unwanted pregnancies. I didn't say TV and video games alone, at this point it's deeply rooted in the culture of kids as young as 12 and it's being perpetuated by their social interaction at school, older grades to younger a Sex without marriage is a recent cultural change, dead beat dads are guys who were looking for some fun not a family just like women who abort their kids. It's impossible for a woman to commit adultery without a man's help (or at least before all this homosexuality stuff). It's true that women were considered more responsible for sex than men but to imply that adultery committed by men was not similarly despised is madness. It's perfectly valid history, if you don't hear about it much it's because it was so severely regarded that not many did it. Before Christianity the more powerful house almost always had their way, if the daughter was from the more powerful house you would not want to be a runaway husband. Further the actual outcome was based more on the spin. Nobody abandoned their wife and child and said they didn't want to take care of them anymore, they came up with an excuse like the child was illegitimate. Their need to lie is all the evidence you should need that it was unacceptable to simply abandon familial responsibilities. Well then that comes back to the corruption of marriage. If people get married and still think they should not be responsible for their children they're missing the point. Fidelity to the spouse is only one half of the coin. Objectively sex is pleasurable but it is also a reproductive process (between fertile adults of the same species but different gender). I can't take the pleasure out by identifying the truth. They need to have plan A and plan B. In either case they use contraceptive techniques to avoid having a child until they want one. Plan A is the good chance that this will work and they won't get pregnant. Plan B is the small chance that it will not work, they must then be willing to accelerate their plans. The reason marriage is important is because it means they are already 80% of the way there. They have committed to each other and should have understood that marriage is also committing to any children. They don't need to wait, they can bet on plan A because contraceptive measures can be highly effective. If however they find plan B totally unacceptable, i.e. they would kill the child or put them up for adoption they should not have sex. You do not make bets you are unwilling to lose, it's that simple. See how prevalent noneducational about marriage is? Yea sure marriage hasn't been corrupted if you don't even know what an uncorrupted meaning of marriage is. How did it start out? because the oldest written laws in the world deal with children in marriage like it's expected. No they're about the same (hint hint) It has happened, it was happening for thousands of years at a time. There has never once been a great civilization that did not address the responsibility towards children unless (like today) it accepted killing them. Lol, not every woman; the ones who are being promiscuous and then getting abortions. If you didn't want to take the test today you should not have signed up yesterday.. So with such stakes as those on the line would people take the test only when their ready or would they rush in? Your problem with analogies is that you don't notice the relevant aspects. It put abortion on the table, legally and safely. I am stating that murder is not a private matter. Morality dictates what a person can and cannot do, and government (along with anyone else) has the right to enforce morality, that is what it means. Morality does not depend on how society benefits. It is a child when it is conceived. Then it needs to be rebuilt. Why? It is a human as a collection of cells, it becomes a bigger collection of cells and then comes out at which point you decide it exists. If it was murder to kill an adult tapeworm then it would be murder to kill a young tapeworm. The inability to save two lives is not an exception to the unacceptability of murder. Human beings do not have a right to life, they have a right to not be murdered. Carrying a child to term is natural, you would have to go out of your way to kill and remove the child in order to interrupt the process. That is murder. The premise I am starting from is that adults are responsible for taking care of children. Otherwise you could just abandon them as soon as they come out and technically you did not bring about their death, you just didn't help keep them alive. Killing the mother does have bearing, an operation which saves the mother without saving the child is not murder unless no consideration for the life of the child was made. Sperm and egg is a potential human being, fertilized egg is a human being. Not a sentient human being, not even a thinking human being; but a newborn is probably not sentient either as ipetrified has pointed out. That is not the principle used when we make it illegal to throw babies off cliffs, when we still consider murdering a sleeping person murder. The principle is that you do not intentionally kill innocent individuals of a sentient species. I am merely being consistent. The difference between a fertilized egg and gametes is biologically clear, that is when the individual organism is formed. Our genes themselves decide that is when a new human has been created because at that point the cells cease to behave as guardians of DNA from the organism and begin to behave as components of a new organism. But the slope has a foothold because I am not claiming that potential life must be protected. Abstinence, don't tell me it's not practical; it's human choice. What babies being absolutely unacceptable or birth control being imperfect?
