Jyoshu is correct, this is the natural evolution because at no point did any pro-deathers ever stop and consider by what principle they were deciding who has a right to life and who does not except whether they wanted them alive or not. None of the superficial excuses were rational, and indeed without a comprehensive moral theory there was no hope of it. If there is anything the left fears it is the concept of a comprehensive moral theory. If sensation was sufficient then animals would have a right to life. If lack of conscious thought made it OK to kill then killing a sleeping person would be alright. If it is permissible to kill the child because it is dependent on you than you would be able to kill them up until they got a job.","simone","454273","Commercially raised eggs are not fertilized. However, if you raise your own chickens for eggs and if you have a rooster or two in the flock, you very likely will be consuming fertilized eggs -- which are not chickens when the eggs are freshly laid.","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","01:29 PM","abortion-debates","34"

The one I learned in my thrity years in the Teamsters union, is that mixing politics and labor is a bad cocktail. The Teamsters never liked the idea, but as with most of the country's labor, sort of got forced into it, becasue while under fire from the Republicans, it was a way of getting our message heard. The Teamsters however, have never been a partisan group either. The socialist / anrchist / peace and social justice left have done just as much damage to this country in my view as the radical right. Every time I think of extremes in this country, I of images of the KKK, witch burnings, and women burning their bras: it's all silly and dangerous.","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","03:56 PM","abortion-debates","37"

The influence that the trade union movement had on British politics( both Labour and Conservative governments) gave the Trotskyite and Workers revolutionary factions power far beyond what their low numbers should have done. The extreme political leanings of union officials ultimately made Britain a manufacturing basket case . While the Japanese exported good quality cars to us our cars manufacturers were striking over tea breaks and producing ' Friday afternoon' lemons..to name just one unionised industry.So I agree with you that politics and labour do not mix. Ive seen the best of union activity and maybe not the worst but some aspects of my own union that I am not proud of ..to say the least. America has more extremes and more extremists than the UK. IMO much of the dynamism of American thought and action comes from the lack of social care in US society.. plus( believe it or not) gun ownership. A society where there is no safety net must be more dynamic than a society built around one. However I have no valid opinion on how Americans should live their lives so I try to argue points that are relatively parallel with the UK.","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","05:21 PM","abortion-debates","38"

"05-12-2012","16187",3,"jet57","454872","Well spiffy; I'm waiting. You haven't refuted me yet The American conservative movement is not defined by a set of policies but rather by a commitment to conserve America's first principles and its tradition of limited self-government. Conservatism holds that these first principlesproclaimed in the Declaration of Independence and promulgated by the United States Constitutiondefine us as a country and inspire us as a people. Conservatives believe that the original structure of America's carefully written constitution and its enduring framework of limited government is the best mechanism for securing national independence, providing economic opportunity, establishing religious liberty, and maintaining a flourishing society of republican self-government. Conservatives believe that the change we need, the change that is consistent with the American idea, is not movement away from but toward our principleswhich are both the fixed goal and the unchanging ground of our ever-changing experience. There are, of course, a wide variety of groups and movements within the conservative movement itself. Some are primarily focused on strengthening our national defense, others are concerned primarily with social issues, and still others are driven primarily to advance economic freedom. Although each of these groups is unique, they are all fused together into an identifiable movementthe conservative movementby a common commitment to conserve America's first principles and political traditions.","Freedom","454877","First we must establish what being 'to the right' is defined by.

The tombstone marking the grave of Adolf Hitler's parents in Austria has been removed, officials say, to end its use as a pilgrimage site for right-wing extremists. The German Workers' Party, the forerunner of the Nazi Party, espoused a right-wing ideology, like many similar groups of demobilized soldiers. Adolf Hitler joined this small political party in 1919 and rose to leadership through his emotional and captivating speeches. He encouraged national pride, militarism, and a commitment to the Volk and a racially ""pure"" Germany. German Workers' Party : As the precursor to the Nazi Party, Hitler joined the right-wing Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (DAP) in 1919. The party espoused national pride, militarism, a commitment to the Volk, and a racially ""pure"" Germany. His [Himmlers] military ambitions thwarted by the Versailles treaty, Himmler instead turned to politics, becoming increasingly involved with various right wing nationalist paramilitaries and political parties; this eventually led him to join Ernst Rhm's SA (Sturmabteilung) and the National Socialist Party. Himmler gradually turned his back on Catholicism and his parents' more traditional brand of nationalism, becoming increasingly indoctrinated into the anti-Communist, anti-Semitic party line.","jet57","454896","Well, first of all, citing the heritage foundation's definition of conservatism is like citing Joseph Goebbels definition of National Socialism; you know that don't you . . .
