That you could often see girls and women squatting in the gutters going to the bathroom right in front of everyone? That in the alleys they'd tie a clothesline up and place a cardboard box top over it and that was a shelter for a family of four so they could cook their pot of rice? I'd ask you what their favorite sauce was and describe it to me? What was the tallest building in Saigon in 1968 and what was on the top floor? Ever seen an Arc-Light raid? Do you know which Saigon landmark the VC took over and occupied for a week or more during the Tet Offensive, and why they decided to take it? What's a P38?

You haven't refuted me yet The American conservative movement is not defined by a set of policies but rather by a commitment to conserve America's first principles and its tradition of limited self-government. Conservatism holds that these first principlesproclaimed in the Declaration of Independence and promulgated by the United States Constitutiondefine us as a country and inspire us as a people. Conservatives believe that the original structure of America's carefully written constitution and its enduring framework of limited government is the best mechanism for securing national independence, providing economic opportunity, establishing religious liberty, and maintaining a flourishing society of republican self-government. Conservatives believe that the change we need, the change that is consistent with the American idea, is not movement away from but toward our principleswhich are both the fixed goal and the unchanging ground of our ever-changing experience. There are, of course, a wide variety of groups and movements within the conservative movement itself. Some are primarily focused on strengthening our national defense, others are concerned primarily with social issues, and still others are driven primarily to advance economic freedom. Although each of these groups is unique, they are all fused together into an identifiable movementthe conservative movementby a common commitment to conserve America's first principles and political traditions.","Freedom","454877","First we must establish what being 'to the right' is defined by.

The tombstone marking the grave of Adolf Hitler's parents in Austria has been removed, officials say, to end its use as a pilgrimage site for right-wing extremists. The German Workers' Party, the forerunner of the Nazi Party, espoused a right-wing ideology, like many similar groups of demobilized soldiers. Adolf Hitler joined this small political party in 1919 and rose to leadership through his emotional and captivating speeches. He encouraged national pride, militarism, and a commitment to the Volk and a racially ""pure"" Germany. German Workers' Party : As the precursor to the Nazi Party, Hitler joined the right-wing Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (DAP) in 1919. The party espoused national pride, militarism, a commitment to the Volk, and a racially ""pure"" Germany. His [Himmlers] military ambitions thwarted by the Versailles treaty, Himmler instead turned to politics, becoming increasingly involved with various right wing nationalist paramilitaries and political parties; this eventually led him to join Ernst Rhm's SA (Sturmabteilung) and the National Socialist Party. Himmler gradually turned his back on Catholicism and his parents' more traditional brand of nationalism, becoming increasingly indoctrinated into the anti-Communist, anti-Semitic party line.","jet57","454896","Well, first of all, citing the heritage foundation's definition of conservatism is like citing Joseph Goebbels definition of National Socialism; you know that don't you . . .

So define it please. In April, 1920, Hitler advocated that the party should change its name to the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP). Hitler had always been hostile to socialist ideas, especially those that involved racial or sexual equality. However, socialism was a popular political philosophy in Germany after the First World War. This was reflected in the growth in the German Social Democrat Party (SDP), the largest political party in Germany. Hitler, therefore redefined socialism by placing the word 'National' before it. He claimed he was only in favour of equality for those who had ""German blood"". Jews and other ""aliens"" would lose their rights of citizenship, and immigration of non-Germans should be brought to an end. In September 1919, Hitler visited, as a V-Man, a meeting of the German Workers' Party. The party name indicated that it had socialist leanings with its ""workers'"" tag. It was, in fact, an extreme, anti-Semitic, anti-communist, right wing nationalist party lead by Karl Drexler. At Hitler's visit, it only had 40 members. Hitler informed the army that it posed no threat to Germany. After this visit, Hitler joined the party as it seemed to represent all that he believed in. He quickly became the party's propaganda officer. In early 1920, the party changed its name to the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) which quickly got corrupted to 'Nazi' by both enemies and supporters alike. Hitler wrote out the party's beliefs in the so-called 25 Point Party Programme. This party programme was a curious mixture - right wing nationalism; anti-capitalism; anti-socialism; anti-wealth etc.","jet57","455074","Uh, no; people are not under any delusions about the right-wing. People are wise to whats going on. The Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei: National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP). The party was formed in 1919 by nationalist ex military men, one of whom was Ernst Rhome who militarized the party and was one of two who recruited Hitler strictly because of his oratory skills. Socialism was extremely popular in Europe with the fall of empire. Adolf Hitler allowed the word socialist to stay in the workers party as a come on to get people to sign on. Heres more: Nazi Party (NSDAP) Adolf Hitler 1918 to 1924 Hitler targeted; socialists, communists, unionists, freemasons; anybody or any group that was outside his revised nazi party. The very reason for Auschwitz concentration camp in 1933 was for a place to put these political prisoners in the first place. Having said that, I dont claim that todays right-wing are Nazis; I claim that todays right-wing are using the very same techniques, both in actual practice and their media. One great example is this business by the right-of real Americans; Hitler and the SS espoused the true German. If you werent a true German, you were less than, you were a traitor; you couldnt marry . . . etc etc. Knomb Chomsky said it very clearly as well: todays right-wing media is very much the same as 1933 Germany: you just have to know what youre looking for.

ABSTRACT: In the post 9-11 world, terrorism has been primarily associated with the external threat from radical Islamic extremists. Prior to September 11, 2001 the single most destructive weapon of mass destruction in the United States was the Ryder truck bomb built by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. Both McVeigh and Nichols harbored extreme right-wing anti-government beliefs they felt justified the bombing. A high level of anti-American government sentiment was a common element shared by McVeigh, Nichols, and the al Qaeda terrorists on the 9-11 aircraft. This article asks if the threat of violence by right-wing extremists, including their possible deployment of weapons of mass destruction, has been neutralized. Information to better understand the level of threat posed by right-wing groups includes the need to understand their ideology and history, along with a review of past and present individuals who influenced the growth and development of the radical right, including the following groups: Christian Identity; militias; Sovereign Citizens, Freemen, and Common Law Courts; Ku Klux Klan; neo-Nazis; and Skinheads. Central to the agenda is white supremacism, preservation of individual wealth in a setting of free market capitalism, preservation of rigidly traditional religious and family structures, and defense of US military hegemony. There is virtually universal agreement that para-military white supremacists or neo-Nazis are right wing. More subtle distinctions are required when right-wing groups operate within mainstream US culture.","jet57","455167","The right-wing in this country has been shown to be dangerously nationalist, they exercise a belligerent and chauvinistic foreign policy based more on manifest destiny than anything else.
