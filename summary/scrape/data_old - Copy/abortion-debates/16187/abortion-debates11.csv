"10-14-2012","16187",11,"ipetrified","464217","I am not understanding your question per say. So let me answer it the best I can. Psychiatry is medicine. Psychiatrists practice medicine (in the US, psychiatrists have an MD). They deal with the physiological factors pertaining to mental illnesses. For example, depression may be the result of a neurotransmitter imbalance and usually goes hand in hand with low energy, fatigue etc.. The medicine fixes the imbalance and attempts to make you feel physically better. But it does not treat the illness itself, which is usually the result of a thought process we do not consider normal. Now, metacognition is not an arbitrary criteria which makes us superior to other animals. It is the only reasonable thing that you can point out which makes us superior. Because it allows our innovation. And no, other primates are not innovative, they are only conditioned. If we were not able to innovate ways to survive, we obviously would not be at the top of the food chain. (A male deer, or a buck, could easily maul a human to death. Without our ancestors innovating spears and other projectiles... we would have had a tough time bringing them down with a sharp rock and fists) Since.. baby's and fetus's cannot perform metacognition, they are not aware of themselves; thus, they are in equal standing with each other. Although I do have to agree with you, since we KNOW for 100% fact that fetus's aren't self aware. Baby's begin coming close to that grey area (18months) where they do become conscious. This would make me uncomfortable with the idea of aborting them. But if there is no question, no doubt, that the baby is not self conscious... then it really isn't that which makes us humans, humans. True, it would eventually develop consciousness. But, until it is capable of that independent thought through its own consciousness, a baby is a mere vessel. And you are putting very close together, with what could have been with what actually is. Although, most baby's do develop consciousness. Only a few don't due to factors outside of anyone's control. And be a few... I mean very, very few. Ex: damage to the brain Non the less, it is important to separate that which could have been and what actually is. Your argument, that a baby is superior since it will most likely develop consciousness. Is the same logic that would say that a High School student can buy a Ferrari because he/she wants to go to college to be a Doctor. But in reality, one has to become a doctor first to afford the Ferrari -- humans tend to say one thing but do the contrary.","gansao","464228","No it isnt. The norm is that an human infant will develop metacognition. No other species that you know of has this potential in its infants.That makes the human infant superior to other species and this should be recognised. Your analogy of a high school student and ferrari is flawed. A better analogy is a bank account. The high school student would be considered to be superior accountee than an imbecile. The imbecile may be getting benefits that are greater than the high school students pocket money but the bank would consider the high school student a superior customer . Also a pre metacognition baby and a fetus are plainly not on equal standing with each other..only if one uses your arbitary standard. A fetus can range from a multi celled blob to a viable baby. I do not consider a sentient fetus to be equal to fetus that weighs a gram( and I consider a fetus that feels pain or stress sentient..you can choose your own definition). You may or may not be correct in stating that metacognition is the factor that makes humans superior to other species but that does not mean that human fetuses or or pre metacognition infants are the equivalent of other species( which is what you are implying).","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","03:11 AM","abortion-debates","151"

I could not think of a good one. But back to the thought. You tag in pain and stress to being sentient. But sentient in consciousness. Many animals feel pain or stress. No other animal may know why it is in stress. Only that it wants to not be stressed. We humans can think about thinking. It is the basis of consciousness as we know it. You cannot be conscious of yourself because that would imply you can think about yourself/ your actions/ your thoughts. So beings who can perform metacognition = beings of consciousness = sentient beings. You couldn't define one without the other. I am only trying to assert that a fetus and baby are not conscious of themselves. Thus on the same standing. They may later develop it. But at that point and time, they do not possess it. So it would not make much more of a difference to abort a fetus then a newborn (0-2wks)..","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","11:04 AM","abortion-debates","152"

Now it is known that new borns do feel pain but cannot express it. A sentient baby or fetus is aware that it is suffering, if it is suffering and thats a good enough reason for me not to make an infant of my own species suffer. The fact that it MAY be incapable of( or demonstate to the satisfaction of current science ) introspection is does not mean that new borns should be considered a lower species or a candidate for euthanasia at the whim of other humans Past connections or bonds have nothing to do with your argument. You have stated that a human is not fully human without the capability of metacognition. Saying a human is still a sapien if it HAD metacognition is no more of a valid argument than saying that human is a sapien if it WILL develop metacognition. What this does demonstate is that while you may have an argument in saying that new borns cannot demonstrate metacognition. Your argument that they are essentially sub human because of this is nothing more than a personal view.","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","05:24 AM","abortion-debates","155"
"10-17-2012","16187",11,"Freedom","463546","What planet do you live on? Simply telling someone to think about it now because it will be a bad situation if it happens does discourage it to happen. The reason it is a bad situation is because it is murder to kill your children so you are stuck with 9 months of pregnancy and would be stuck with even more if there were no orphanages. It sure has for the people who are throwing out the bath water because there is a baby in it. Except in the case of rape, yes. And since the procedure requires who consent as well, the abortion is in every case. Revisionist history, women's rights may not have been ideal; but rape has always been considered an abomination by every civilization. Those societies which placed strong pressures on women to make themselves available (like prearranged marriages) also gave them full social support in taking care of any children. Yea, humiliating in the frame work of marriages being the only proper place for sex and kids. It worked in 19th century America, and I'd gladly use that as a model for sexual behavior that could produce children. No, getting married later is the solution; the one requiring marriage leads to. Then what's changed or are you one of those nut cases who thinks nothing's changed we just know about it now? No, the stigma attached to runaway fathers is as old as that attached to bastards, adulterers, and women getting pregnant out of wedlock. In many places the girls family would hold you to responsibility through force. I know the trend to wait for marriage is new, because you don't need marriage to bang each other anymore; and that's the problem. Marriage is functionally the acceptance of a possible family, and sex is making a family possible. Sex before marriage is risking an event before accepting it as a possible consequence. That is why people are freaking out and getting abortions, they were just in it for a good time; they don't want a family, often the family cannot even be constructed. The point of marriage was so that children didn't come into the world with no hope of a healthy family support being insufficiently cared for by someone who thinks of them as the thing that ruined their life. ... and pro-deathers have the audacity to claim that this tragedy is why abortion is necessary. I really believe that if you take murdering your neighbor off the table, peaceful neighborhoods would 'somehow' take hold. I personally don't care if a generation does have to reinvent the wheel and learn the hard way to not have sex until your ready to have kids. When they do learn they will teach it to their kids, and presto conservative values take hold. I think it is to a large degree. If you were taking a test, and the professor places a card with all the answers on your desk. They tell you, that you can look at it as a last resort. You get stuck on a problem and ask if there is any penalty for looking at the answers. They then assure you that it's not your fault. They say that since you are stuck and there is not enough time left for you to get the answer on your own, telling you to study is just making a bad problem worse; and it wouldn't do to get bad grades. So you look at the card and you might feel bad about cheating for a while, but you get over it because as everyone keeps telling you; you are the victim. If I made this policy at a school do you think studying would go up or down? Just because I know you have particular difficulty with any and all analogies I will break it down for you. Studying on your own is using contraceptives, a good chance of working but not perfect. The cheat sheet the professor gives you is abortion. Only having sex after marriage is like bringing the book to the test and having 24 hours to complete the test.... studying means you won't have to stay as long, but even if you do it's alright. Don't tell me people ignore it as an option, and don't tell me options don't affect people's decisions. Roe v Wade effectively made it so that if any mother does not want to take responsibility for their offspring they do not have to. Very few people are cannibals, you could say society is at a point where that's just not a danger; but it doesn't really follow that we only outlaw things that aren't happening does it? It is unacceptable to wait until no one wants to kill their children just as it would be unacceptable to wait until no one wants to eat other people. You outlaw it and if the temptation goes away all the better. I don't need to take their word, I just charge them if they are negligent with their children. What are you trying to say? That people can't control themselves? The desire is not going to go away, but if you really cannot find any other way to release other than acts which may produce children then you should be ready to take care of children. Thinking of yourself as the inevitable minion of ancient imperatives is a sure way to erode self-control about sex. I am not religious and this is not about limiting earthly pleasure, but it is an objective fact that condoms and pills do not work 100% of the time; just as it is an objective fact that you are killing your offspring if you have an abortion. Anyone who thinks regular homicide is the price of pleasure and intimacy has a serious miscalculation of values. If we want to have sex all the time without getting married that would actually be the best strategy. Not kids at birth of course, whenever they want to start having sex you collect and store enough gametes so that if and when they want kids they have the material then you sterilize them so they can go off and have as many consequence-less orgies as they want. Realizing the truth is perfect. Birth control is imperfect and so it should never be used where full term pregnancy is absolutely unacceptable. Outlawing abortion will fix the abortion problem.","pappillion001","464495","I live in reality. You should stop by some time it isn't the best place, but in the long run it is better than fantasy. I am not saying don't talk to kids about consequences or that even sometimes it works, but based on results it doesn't work as well as any one would like. When they start killing their kids then it will be a bad situation. A cluster of cells is not a child. We are not talking about babies. We are talking about cells. The demographic, you mean people started to have more abortions before it became legal? So wouldn't legalizing it then by validating the trend towards irresponsible behavior? Exception, you are kidding? Get your facts straight. To say it was viewed as an abomination and leave it at that is a gross misinterpretation of history. No they didn't. You missed the point entirely. Did it really? If you were to go back and have to live under those same conditions you would look for another example. And that is a rising trend, but it still does not provide for a solution for you. There are still plenty of couples who become pregnant having no desire to be parents. Parental participation in the raising of children. Those glory days of the 1800's saw a much larger segment of the population on farms and an even larger having a parent at home. Until school became mandatory and child labor laws kicked in kids were at home or at a job, but keep thinking its TV and video games. By all means keep blaming Donkey Kong and 90210 as the reason kids have been led astray. Deadbeat dads are a recent culture change in the US, The stigma of bastards is old, but you have to look at the reasoning behind that which undermines your first statement. That would be women adulters, men even today usually end up no worse off after a short period of time. Of course unwed mothers were looked down upon, the man well the double standard is not a myth That makes for good TV, but bad history. Well if it was only teenage girls it would be a problem, but it is not. You just took all the pleasure out of sex and turned it into nothing more than a reproductive process. Should the newlyweds who don't want a family until they spend a few years married avoid sex? That is not even close to what the point of marriage was. It has evolved into something that can resemble that, but it didn't start that way. Are tyrants any less audacious? That is a dream that will never happen. In every single instance conservative values have lasted a few years before their repressive nature drives people to liberal rebellion. You seem to think that every woman sees abortion as a means of birth control and that knowledge frees them to become far more promiscuous. There is an emotional penalty to your test and let's put more value on the results. If you don't pass there is a good chance you will live at or below the poverty line, you will struggle to provide for yourself and children, you will most likely face this alone and odds are good your child will lead the same disappointing life awaiting you. There is no retest and while you may have planned on taking the test you didn't think it would be today. I have problems with analogies that create favorable comparison by leaving out relevant aspects. Making the whole thing pointless not clever And how did it accomplish that? Are you suggesting that the government does have the right to invade a woman's privacy? That government does have the right to dictate what a person can and cannot do? But then if all those myths were true about eating dead people then it probably would be legal since it would serve a purpose for the benefit of society. So it really depends on hoe society benefits As soon as it is a child then be my guest, but not before. Wake up it is already eroded. Heck according to the Bible abstinence isn't even 100%. When the abortion is performed it is not someone's offspring. It must be born to be so. It is a collection of cells that have the potential to develop into a human over 9 months. Would you say it is murder to have a tapeworm removed? Its alive, it usually doesn't harm the host? It didn't intentionally invade it's host. It can't survive without the host? You seem to be willing to make exceptions, but how can you? Your argument is it is a human being that has a right to life and the mother is obligated to carry it to term. That it will be deformed or possibly kill the mother or is the product of rape or incest has no bearing. Even one step further why even permit birth control? The only difference between a potential person as you define it and an unfertilized egg is sperm. Both are potential human beings. Women should not be permitted to menstruate. They should constantly be pregnant and men can't be killing their contribution to the process either. That is the path your on. Do you have anything that is actually viable? Why don't we just say yapple dapple or use the Magic Eight Ball or even a time machine if she becomes pregnant she can go back and not have sex?

Birth control especially is just effective enough so that kids aren't worried and just ineffective enough that you still have an unacceptable number of unwanted pregnancies. A child is a cluster of cells. Maybe you didn't listen in school when they told you what your body is made up of. No No I don't think it is. Yes they did. Then clarify. Not for sexual responsibility. If they are absolutely unwilling to be parents then they should engage in absolutely no intercourse. If there is any chance of children they need to have a plan and it is not appropriate to plan on adoption or murder. Fascinating theory but it's kind of lacking a mechanism besides oversight. When parents sent their kids to boarding schools they weren't participating, but the boarding schools were strict and gender segregated; so there weren't unwanted pregnancies. I didn't say TV and video games alone, at this point it's deeply rooted in the culture of kids as young as 12 and it's being perpetuated by their social interaction at school, older grades to younger a Sex without marriage is a recent cultural change, dead beat dads are guys who were looking for some fun not a family just like women who abort their kids. It's impossible for a woman to commit adultery without a man's help (or at least before all this homosexuality stuff). It's true that women were considered more responsible for sex than men but to imply that adultery committed by men was not similarly despised is madness. It's perfectly valid history, if you don't hear about it much it's because it was so severely regarded that not many did it. Before Christianity the more powerful house almost always had their way, if the daughter was from the more powerful house you would not want to be a runaway husband. Further the actual outcome was based more on the spin. Nobody abandoned their wife and child and said they didn't want to take care of them anymore, they came up with an excuse like the child was illegitimate. Their need to lie is all the evidence you should need that it was unacceptable to simply abandon familial responsibilities. Well then that comes back to the corruption of marriage. If people get married and still think they should not be responsible for their children they're missing the point. Fidelity to the spouse is only one half of the coin. Objectively sex is pleasurable but it is also a reproductive process (between fertile adults of the same species but different gender). I can't take the pleasure out by identifying the truth. They need to have plan A and plan B. In either case they use contraceptive techniques to avoid having a child until they want one. Plan A is the good chance that this will work and they won't get pregnant. Plan B is the small chance that it will not work, they must then be willing to accelerate their plans. The reason marriage is important is because it means they are already 80% of the way there. They have committed to each other and should have understood that marriage is also committing to any children. They don't need to wait, they can bet on plan A because contraceptive measures can be highly effective. If however they find plan B totally unacceptable, i.e. they would kill the child or put them up for adoption they should not have sex. You do not make bets you are unwilling to lose, it's that simple. See how prevalent noneducational about marriage is? Yea sure marriage hasn't been corrupted if you don't even know what an uncorrupted meaning of marriage is. How did it start out? because the oldest written laws in the world deal with children in marriage like it's expected. No they're about the same (hint hint) It has happened, it was happening for thousands of years at a time. There has never once been a great civilization that did not address the responsibility towards children unless (like today) it accepted killing them. Lol, not every woman; the ones who are being promiscuous and then getting abortions. If you didn't want to take the test today you should not have signed up yesterday.. So with such stakes as those on the line would people take the test only when their ready or would they rush in? Your problem with analogies is that you don't notice the relevant aspects. It put abortion on the table, legally and safely. I am stating that murder is not a private matter. Morality dictates what a person can and cannot do, and government (along with anyone else) has the right to enforce morality, that is what it means. Morality does not depend on how society benefits. It is a child when it is conceived. Then it needs to be rebuilt. Why? It is a human as a collection of cells, it becomes a bigger collection of cells and then comes out at which point you decide it exists. If it was murder to kill an adult tapeworm then it would be murder to kill a young tapeworm. The inability to save two lives is not an exception to the unacceptability of murder. Human beings do not have a right to life, they have a right to not be murdered. Carrying a child to term is natural, you would have to go out of your way to kill and remove the child in order to interrupt the process. That is murder. The premise I am starting from is that adults are responsible for taking care of children. Otherwise you could just abandon them as soon as they come out and technically you did not bring about their death, you just didn't help keep them alive. Killing the mother does have bearing, an operation which saves the mother without saving the child is not murder unless no consideration for the life of the child was made. Sperm and egg is a potential human being, fertilized egg is a human being. Not a sentient human being, not even a thinking human being; but a newborn is probably not sentient either as ipetrified has pointed out. That is not the principle used when we make it illegal to throw babies off cliffs, when we still consider murdering a sleeping person murder. The principle is that you do not intentionally kill innocent individuals of a sentient species. I am merely being consistent. The difference between a fertilized egg and gametes is biologically clear, that is when the individual organism is formed. Our genes themselves decide that is when a new human has been created because at that point the cells cease to behave as guardians of DNA from the organism and begin to behave as components of a new organism. But the slope has a foothold because I am not claiming that potential life must be protected. Abstinence, don't tell me it's not practical; it's human choice. What babies being absolutely unacceptable or birth control being imperfect?
