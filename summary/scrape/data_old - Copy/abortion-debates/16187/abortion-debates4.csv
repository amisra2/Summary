In April, 1920, Hitler advocated that the party should change its name to the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP). Hitler had always been hostile to socialist ideas, especially those that involved racial or sexual equality. However, socialism was a popular political philosophy in Germany after the First World War. This was reflected in the growth in the German Social Democrat Party (SDP), the largest political party in Germany. Hitler, therefore redefined socialism by placing the word 'National' before it. He claimed he was only in favour of equality for those who had ""German blood"". Jews and other ""aliens"" would lose their rights of citizenship, and immigration of non-Germans should be brought to an end. In September 1919, Hitler visited, as a V-Man, a meeting of the German Workers' Party. The party name indicated that it had socialist leanings with its ""workers'"" tag. It was, in fact, an extreme, anti-Semitic, anti-communist, right wing nationalist party lead by Karl Drexler. At Hitler's visit, it only had 40 members. Hitler informed the army that it posed no threat to Germany. After this visit, Hitler joined the party as it seemed to represent all that he believed in. He quickly became the party's propaganda officer. In early 1920, the party changed its name to the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) which quickly got corrupted to 'Nazi' by both enemies and supporters alike. Hitler wrote out the party's beliefs in the so-called 25 Point Party Programme. This party programme was a curious mixture - right wing nationalism; anti-capitalism; anti-socialism; anti-wealth etc.","jet57","455074","Uh, no; people are not under any delusions about the right-wing. People are wise to whats going on. The Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei: National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP). The party was formed in 1919 by nationalist ex military men, one of whom was Ernst Rhome who militarized the party and was one of two who recruited Hitler strictly because of his oratory skills. Socialism was extremely popular in Europe with the fall of empire. Adolf Hitler allowed the word socialist to stay in the workers party as a come on to get people to sign on. Heres more: Nazi Party (NSDAP) Adolf Hitler 1918 to 1924 Hitler targeted; socialists, communists, unionists, freemasons; anybody or any group that was outside his revised nazi party. The very reason for Auschwitz concentration camp in 1933 was for a place to put these political prisoners in the first place. Having said that, I dont claim that todays right-wing are Nazis; I claim that todays right-wing are using the very same techniques, both in actual practice and their media. One great example is this business by the right-of real Americans; Hitler and the SS espoused the true German. If you werent a true German, you were less than, you were a traitor; you couldnt marry . . . etc etc. Knomb Chomsky said it very clearly as well: todays right-wing media is very much the same as 1933 Germany: you just have to know what youre looking for. So, I would strongly suggest that you study this subject quite a bit more before you try and refute the truth about it.","killing-babies-no-different-abortion-experts-say","07:14 PM","abortion-debates","46"

ABSTRACT: In the post 9-11 world, terrorism has been primarily associated with the external threat from radical Islamic extremists. Prior to September 11, 2001 the single most destructive weapon of mass destruction in the United States was the Ryder truck bomb built by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. Both McVeigh and Nichols harbored extreme right-wing anti-government beliefs they felt justified the bombing. A high level of anti-American government sentiment was a common element shared by McVeigh, Nichols, and the al Qaeda terrorists on the 9-11 aircraft. This article asks if the threat of violence by right-wing extremists, including their possible deployment of weapons of mass destruction, has been neutralized. Information to better understand the level of threat posed by right-wing groups includes the need to understand their ideology and history, along with a review of past and present individuals who influenced the growth and development of the radical right, including the following groups: Christian Identity; militias; Sovereign Citizens, Freemen, and Common Law Courts; Ku Klux Klan; neo-Nazis; and Skinheads. Central to the agenda is white supremacism, preservation of individual wealth in a setting of free market capitalism, preservation of rigidly traditional religious and family structures, and defense of US military hegemony. There is virtually universal agreement that para-military white supremacists or neo-Nazis are right wing. More subtle distinctions are required when right-wing groups operate within mainstream US culture.","jet57","455167","The right-wing in this country has been shown to be dangerously nationalist, they exercise a belligerent and chauvinistic foreign policy based more on manifest destiny than anything else.

Liberal Fundamentalism Theres a particularly pernicious brand of fundamentalism making the rounds in America today liberal fundamentalism. Liberal Fundamentalism is a failed and destructive philosophical enterprise, replete with a host of anti-Biblical, pseudo-religious doctrines that seeks to elevate the ways and wisdom of man above the wisdom and desires of God. Its principle aim is the sacking of traditional Judaic and Christian values and beliefs, which are revisited through suspect liberal scholarship or politically-correct dogma in an effort to replace them with the tenets of carnal moral hedonism and the failed social doctrines of todays liberal elitists. The genesis of todays liberal fundamentalists was the anti-traditionalist hedonists of the 1960's and 70's. They advocated fornication and free-love, illegal substance abuse, moral relativism, contempt for authority, and they enjoyed a prosperous America founded on the very hard work and enterprise they sought to distance themselves from. The freedoms they enjoyed were purchased by the blood, sweat and personal sacrifices of the very forefathers they held in contempt. Personal responsibility, self-restraint and self-sacrifice are often foreign concepts to them. Right and wrong, and good and evil were arbitrarily revisited, for such concepts had no objective meaning to them. They had no objective rationality for their hedonistic philosophy other than if it feels good, lets do it. The only righteous cause that qualified for support in their progressive mindset was the undermining and revising of traditional American and Judeo-Christian values. They said not to trust anyone ""over 30,"" and now they're over 30 and say, ""Trust us, and what we teach!"" Thank you, University of Colorado Board Votes to Fire Embattled Professor Ward Churchill | Fox News Ward Churchill. One of the most revered mantras of liberal fundamentalism is equality. The net effect of this experiment, in many instances, was to elevate women via the degradation of men, promote racial equality by instituting race-based preferences and reverse discrimination, engender class warfare against people of means via their socialistic redistribution of wealth schemes (a concept centered in greed for other peoples money, rather than relying on ones own personal initiative and work ethic), and elevate wickedness (sodomy, fornication, pornography, and other ungodly issues) to the plateau of respectability at the expense of traditional Godly values. Along with the failed liberal concept of equality was the mantra of liberal tolerance. However, liberal tolerance is not what it appears to be. It is a contradictory, partisan philosophical perspective with its own rigid set of dogmas. It assumes, for instance, a relativistic view of moral and religious knowledge. This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality, abortion rights, and religious truth claims, leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs. But this posture is often dogmatic, intolerant, and coercive, for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues, and if one does not embrace it, one may likely face public ridicule, demagogic tactics, and perhaps even legal reprisals. Liberal tolerance is therefore neither liberal nor tolerant. Rather than truly embrace freedom, liberal fundamentalists seek to control virtually every aspect of the lives of the masses that are unfortunate enough to be under their fundamentalist rulership. They seek to outlaw SUVs, impose smoking bans while advocating marijuana use, prohibit freedom of religious expression in government and public schools, advocate compulsory training in politically correct opinions and attitudes, seek to enforce Bible bans in schools and the workplace, embrace a de-facto litmus test against pro-life judicial nominees, tell people what and where they can eat, seek to criminalize pro-life demonstrations through the RICO racketeering statute, try to squelch legitimate religious speech via hate-speech laws (note Canada), and generally engage in a wide range of behaviors designed to subvert the U.S. Constitution and traditional American values. It is certainly evident, then, that progressive liberal fundamentalism substantially undermines the basic effectiveness of the government and other societal elements of democracy. Despite the idealistic goals of liberalism, attempts to build a utopian liberal society in America have only led to heightened outbreaks of AIDS, VD, porno-related crime, social divisions, divorce, abortion, drug addictions, deficit spending, the welfare state, a crushing tax burden, the breakdown of the family unit, moral depravity, and numerous other such scourges which have resulted in enormous societal suffering and discontent. As a result, liberal fundamentalism is strongly associated with left-wing fanaticism, reverse-racism, anti-intellectualism, elitism, nihilism, godlessness, and societal violence.
