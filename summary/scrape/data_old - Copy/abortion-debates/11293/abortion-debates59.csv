"12-31-2008","11293",59,"Another opinion","338400","There are a wide range of women - some give full thought to their decisions, others make decisions purely on selfish motives with no thought to other considerations. The same is true for all people of all ages, sexes and nationalities. If all people were good and wise, then we wouldn't need any laws. Laws exist because people make decisions which are sufficiently harmful to others or to society that the state needs to intercede. This is also true for the case of abortion. The great majority of people would find it very unjust for a woman to abort a fetus one day from birth for reasons that are not dire (such as strong risk to her life, etc.). You apparently don't. You certainly have the right to your opinion. The rest of us also have the right to our opinions and we vote accordingly. I personally prefer if people vote on concensus that is determined from discussion and debate than when people vote on an issue simply because they ""know"" they are right. Debate and discussion helps illucidate aspects of an issue that people might not have considered - which is the main usefulness of debate. When you claim that people do not have the right to hold an opinion on this issue, you are not only being hypocritical (since you yourself hold an opinion that you profess) but you also get ignored since this claim doesn't stand up to scrutiny. If you really want to change people's minds, you cannot tell them that they have no right to think, you have to counter their arguements - not ignore them. At least, not if you yourself don't want to be ignored.","chester","338401","Is it the function of the state to examine the motives of women who choose to terminate their pregnancies? Just exactly who would make the determination that a particular woman has a ""selfish motive"" for doing so? What standards would the ""judge"" apply? What appeal from the decision of the judge would be permitted? And just exactly what harm will come to the state if women are permitted the unfettered right to determine the future of their pregnancies? Once again, I seriously doubt that you understand that I don't HAVE an opinion on whether or not a particular woman chooses to terminate her pregnancy or carry it to term. The choice does not concern me; it does not concern you; it does not concern society, and it certainly does not concern the law.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:04 PM","abortion-debates","871"
"01-01-2009","11293",59,"Another opinion","338427","You are missing the point. Of course, the ""opinion"" that I am referring to is not your opinion about a particular pregnancy but about whether or not the state can have any regulation of abortions for the sake of the fetus. Just as with the state protecting the rights of born children, the state has a vested interest in protecting those who cannot protect themselves - expressed in the form of rights of individuals. Part of the debate that we have here in the abortion forum is when such rights begin. Your opinion is one that states that fetuses never have rights. Most others disagree.","chester","338484","Please quit misconstruing what I am saying. One more time, and please read for comprehension this time. My position was, is, and always will be that it is the proper role of each and every pregnant woman to decide what value she gives to her fetus. If any particular woman believes that her fetus is a separate entity and she chooses to protect it with all the resources at her command, I support that. If another pregnant woman chooses to think of her fetus as disposable and acts on that belief, I support that as well. That's the true essence of the pro-choice position - the empowerment of women and the recognition that each and every pregnant woman is capable of making competent choices.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:12 AM","abortion-debates","873"

Most pro-choicers support some balance that gives the woman the choice during much of her pregnancy, but limits her choice in the third trimester because of considerations of the fetus that now is considered either to have rights or to have value that needs to be protected (apart from certain exceptions). Your are WRONG that yours is the accepted pro-choice position. It is not. Yours is simply a minority opinion not only within the US but within the pro-choice position. You are continuing to completely ignore that the fetus is ever worthy of protection. In your view, the woman has absolute power over it always and for whatever reason she chooses - even if she chooses to abort the fetus one day from birth on a whim. Most of us on the pro-choice side are not as blind to the fate of the fetus as you are. Just because you believe something, that does not make it the absolute truth. You need to defend your position if you want to be taken seriously, not just claim that it is self-evident that the woman has absolute choice always. Since 90% of Americans disagree with you, it is clearly not self-evident - especially since you make great efforts at avoiding addressing the opposing arguements. When someone avoids debate on a subject, it becomes clear that they have no rational leg to stand on.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:29 PM","abortion-debates","876"

If the pregnant woman believes that the ""fetus is ever worthy of protection"", the true pro-choice position supports her right to not only believe this but also to act on her belief. If a different pregnant woman, or the same pregnant woman as in example #1 but in different circumstances believes otherwise, the true pro-choice position supports her right not only to believe as she does but also to act on her belief as well. Just because that position pushes your ICK!! button doesn't delegitimize it. Frankly, what percentage of people does or does not agree with me is the most irrelevant thing you can say. Now, if you say the government should interpose itself between the pregnant woman and her choice, please describe the mechanism by which it can do so.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:26 PM","abortion-debates","880"

In the interim, you and your ilk are perfectly free to have each and every woman in your families carry their pregnancies to term. In fact, I would join you in protest if the government ever moved to mandate abortion. BTW, Roe was a masterpiece not of judicial activism, but rather of judicial restraint. What Mr. Justice Blackmun said in effect was that, since there are so many competing theories of when human personhood begins, the Court was not going to pick and choose and particular one and give it the imprimatur of government authority.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:24 PM","abortion-debates","883"

Its quite a slippery slope that's seen in almost all totalitarian governments. We should obviously legislate what we need to make society function and protect human beings from harm, but pointing to a sack of skin, calling it a human, and forcing a woman to squeeze it through her vagina is where the real immorality lies.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:01 PM","abortion-debates","884"
