"01-21-2009","11293",69,"Another opinion","341139","Unlike you, I don't think that there will be terrible consequences to women or to society in general if third trimester abortions are restricted to certain exceptions and the majority of pro-choice supporters and the great majority of Americans in general apparently agree with me. If YOU think there are such terrible consequences, then name them . My guess would be that the only things you would point to is the fringe and very unrealistic paranoid fears of, as in your earlier example, government someday forcing abortion. Most of us actually live and reason in the REAL world, not the world of paranoia.","Steeeeve","341148","Not only this but it wasn't long ago that abortion was illegal in many areas and no horrific consequences existed (awaiting false data of back ally abortions proven wrong many times over). And it still misses the point, in my opinion, because I don't go with the idea that it is ok to do something evil to accomplish a good.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:35 PM","abortion-debates","1021"

OK, how about this. Some of the profetallifers here equate abortion with murder. If indeed that be the case, then abortion is certainly murder most foul, as it is ""murdering the most defenseless"" among us. Since this ""Murder"" is so heinous, nothing less than LWOP will suffice for the woman who undergoes the procedure AND for the doctor who perfoms it. Aftr all, he is an accomplice to the act. Do you agree? Do you disagree? Reasons, please.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:18 PM","abortion-debates","1022"

Can we talk about the punishment for sex-offenders as well?

It sounds like many of the women who regreted abortions never really were the ones freely choosing them to begin with.

I certainly have heard of the back-alley abortions and have read about various cases where such abortions occurred and resulted in severe injury or death so one cannot discount it entirely. However, I do not have the statistics on hand to state how prevalent such back-alley abortions were and how often they resulted in severe medical problems so I will not respond there. However, the book Freakonomics made a reasonable case using statistics to show how the introduction of abortion rights helped reduce future crime rate (> 15 years down the road) since there were far fewer unwanted children in poor families whose unfortunate family situation helped lead them to a life of crime once they reached peak crime years (teenage and 20s). So, outside of the effect on the individual live's of the women involved, that reduction in crime is one positive effect that the introduction of abortion rights had on society. Either way, as you say, one should not do something evil to do something good. Our main difference lies in what we consider evil - where you think even early term abortions are evil whereas I do not.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:18 PM","abortion-debates","1033"

Rarely can one find a law where everyone is in agreement. Either way, I don't often use the word ""evil"" except for the most heinous crimes - serial killers, mass murderers, torture of innocents, etc. So, no, I would not consider late term abortions evil - just bad enough to restrict when they don't meet certain exceptions in order to protect the now sentient fetus.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:11 AM","abortion-debates","1035"
