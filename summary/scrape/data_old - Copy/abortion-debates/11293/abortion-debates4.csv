"08-04-2008","11293",4,"chester","318609","Still, no one here wants to discuss the real question of who gets to make the choice of whether or not to continue a woman's pregnancy. How about it? Who shall it be? There are only two choices - the pregnant woman or the government. Is this really an area where the American people want the government to have such intrusive authority?","Another opinion","318975","Even though I am a pro-choice proponent, so I am disagreeing with someone on my own ""side"", I feel I need to address this point. You seem to say that the woman should make the choice at all stages of pregnancy, for whatever reason she chooses. That is a minority view even among pro-choice proponents. In the most recent poll I found on the subject (from http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm , a CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll. Jan. 10-12, 2003. N=1,002 adults nationwide. MoE 3 ) it found that 84% of respondence thought that third trimester abortions should be generally illegal - meaning illegal minus certain exceptions. Only 10% thought that third trimester abortions should be generally legal. Assuming that 50% of the respondents were pro-choice, this means that at least 68% of pro-choice advocates also thought third trimester abortions should be generally illegal. Note: Interestingly, the poll also found that 66% of respondents thought that first trimester abortions should be generally legal - which would include a minority of pro-life proponents as well. It should also be noted that a few polls I had seen from earlier recent years show similar numbers - so these numbers seem to be pretty reliable. Why does such a majority of the pro-choice side want to limit abortion rights in the third trimester? Mainly, because we realize that the third trimester fetus is getting awfully close to having all the same characteristics as a born baby and the same sympathy we have for born babies start kicking in. In other words, at late term, one needs to consider two sets of rights (whether or not they are officially labelled at this point as rights) as opposed to one. Two people might be involved now, not just one - both mother and late term fetus. As a question to you, do you think there is an inherent difference in the fetus moments before birth vs just after birth, or is it just location?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:44 AM","abortion-debates","48"

The law intrudes at its peril. The same government that today may prohibit abortion may in the future require it. There the law, for everyone's sake, dare not go.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:06 PM","abortion-debates","49"

The UK seems to have been successful in stabilizing the abortion contraversy by generally outlawing late term abortions. This eliminated the most compelling arguements of the pro-life side so that, nowadays, the number of people who would like to further decrease abortion rights is too small to make a lot of political difference. Or at least that is the impression I get from a few Brits who communicated on the subject. It makes political sense. Among other things, pictures of late term aborted fetuses draw sympathy. Pictures of aborted first trimester embryos / fetuses draw much less sympathy. By letting the law give in to the great majority view about late term abortions, you might well make abortion rights MORE safe for the future, not less safe. Indeed, even Roe vs Wade permits the state to limit late term abortions but, unfortunately, it isn't specific enough in its wording about the health exception. Meanwhile, you are ignoring the opposing arguement about fetal rights. What is it that you think about the fetus one day from birth? Is it just an object to you at that stage? Have you no sympathy for any fetus aborted one day from birth if the mother would just suddenly decide against it?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:50 PM","abortion-debates","50"

You've repeated this mantra several times now. What do you mean exactly? Are you saying you can't have an opinion regarding the issue of abortion just because you are a man? Or are you saying that men shouldn't be able to stop a given individual woman ending her pregnancy? On the first count, you're dead wrong. Anyone has the right to have an opinion on this. On the second you're technically correct, but only because of reality and biology--the woman happens to be the one carrying the baby. But there's no higher and greater worth that women have than men. Perhaps it makes you feel you are being chivalrous to take the approach you're taking, but men and women are equal. There's no greater worth one has over the other; it's not really about women having a 'right' than men don't; but rather simply a result of the reality that men the baby happens to be in the female's uterus. It's a fact issue, not a rights issue. Again, you're conflating issues in a rather silly way here. A stance against abortion doesn't require such intent any more than you should need to take becoming-an-adopting-parent under consideration before speaking up trying to stop someone from killing a 3-day old baby . We don't put such requirements in place for debating such issues as these, for good reason. Your insistence to conflate issues here is like someone insisting that, for you to support gun control, you should be willing to be someone's personal body guard for life since they would no longer be able to carry a gun to defend themselves. Otherwise you should have no opinion on that.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:33 AM","abortion-debates","54"

The question I have for you is why you would trust that woman with a child when you can't bring yourself to trust her with that choice. No man, in fact no other person has a right to have an opinion the choice a particular pregnant woman makes regarding the future of her pregnancy. Were one of my daughters or granddaughters to become pregnant, I would love her unconditionally no matter what choice she made. That choice falls to her and to her alone. Society has the obligation to support her in that choice whether or not a particular member of that society agrees with it or not. The law must needs remain silent.

The question for you to ponder is simply this: If you are willing to grant the government the power to ban abortion today, why do you have a problem with that same government requiring abortion or forcing anti-choice people to adopt the ""babies"" they ""save"" tomorrow? Do you really want the government to have such immense power over people's lives?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:19 AM","abortion-debates","56"

For the same reason the government doesn't require adoption if it enacts laws that save the lives of babies that are born. And it certainly makes no sense that to oppose the govt. sanctioning killing is tantamount to forcing killing. There are some sound arguments for the pro-choice position. Invoking forced abortion or the idea of adoption being a prerequisite for opposing abortion aren't among them, seriously.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:54 AM","abortion-debates","58"
"08-05-2008","11293",4,"Another opinion","319165","I brought this up as a hypothetical since it seems that your view of abortion rights would permit such an abortion. If I am wrong about you permitting such an abortion, then please state otherwise. If you would indeed permit such an abortion, then it is highly probably that you have not put any thought into the implications of killing a fetus that, for all intents and purposes, is pretty much the same as a born baby at that point - in all except location.","chester","319182","Sorry, AO, but all I can do is repeat my former position, which you seem to not understand. I do not HAVE a position on ""abortion rights"". As a man, I am not entitled to an opinion on the issue. My position is as it has always been, that this is a choice that must needs be left to the pregnant woman alone. There are those who believe a person exists from conception, such as the RC Church, and there are others who believe there is no person present until birth., such as the US Census Bureau. Because of this, the law must, for its own sake, and for ours, remain silent. Now, try as you might to conflate the issue, that is not a position on abortion ; it's a position on the law . If you believe otherwise, please lay out just what sanction the law should take against a woman who chooses a late-term abortion. We all know that, in order for the government to ensure that its laws are obeyed, there must be a penalty for breaking it. While you are pondering that issue, remind yourself, please, that there are many who consider abortion to be murder, and we also know that those same folks consider it to be the murder of the ""most innocent in society"". If that indeed be that case, any sanction short of the Death Penalty would seem to be highly inappropriate, wouldn't you say? Secondarily, you will need to consider the issue of whom the penalty should be exacted against - the woman, her physician, or both. Are you really willing to see either of them led to the execution chamber for this ""crime""?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:20 AM","abortion-debates","59"

It's strictly a woman-only debate, and no men should even come to an opinion? That's pretty silly. And what about all the pro-choice men out there??? You do know you're saying they can't have an opinion either, right? Curious ... what if one is a woman, but is born sterile and therefore can't get pregnant? Do they still get to have an opinion? I have to admit I'm a little flabbergasted at your position that men aren't entitled to have any opinion on this issue.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:56 AM","abortion-debates","60"
