You have a very unrealistic, condescending and punitive towards a woman's sexuality. How about you worry about your privates and keep your sleazy, intrusive comments about mine to yourself. You remind me of the drunk scuzzball in the bar who thinks he has some rights to me because he has penis. The point I am making and you are failing to grasp is that women facing an unwanted pregnancy are facing serious issues. Misogynistic comments about ""convenience"" and ""keeping their legs shut"" until they are the appropriate property of some fella serves NOTHING but your own ego. It will not help women or children. It astonishes me how many lifers really aren't interested in working on reducing abortion. Their goal is the illusion that they are somehow moral in the demonization of women in a difficult situation. Its about their ego.","antonia","337692","Really well said, Jitobear.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:43 PM","abortion-debates","826"

"12-22-2008","11293",56,"Another opinion","337680","I don't think that the situation is as bleak as you describe. Yes, the rhethoric between the two opposing political camps has been fairly heated in the last years - especially since the rise of the neo-Conservative movement. However, there are quite a few people who do try to have real discussions, not just flaming - on both sides. There are certainly more than enough flamers to go around on either political side but that shouldn't blind you to the real discussions that do occur. Also, many, perhaps most, of those who flame are also capable of genuine open discussion as long as you are able to ratchet down the level of animosity in the rhethoric. I hold on to a firm belief that, as long as one keeps the discussion calm on ones own end, avoids any insulting rhethoric, and genuinely tries to understand and respond to the opposing arguements, then one can end up having a reasonable discussion with most posters - even flamers. This has happened often enough that it keeps me encouraged. That doesn't mean that there aren't those who are irrationally beligerent no matter what. You just have to recognize those and then ignore them until they go away (which they usually eventually do if enough people ignore them).","Winston Smith","337723","Chile has always been a democratic society where political opinions are held strongly. I used to listen to my father and friends discuss politics but because they had similar views centre to centre right I only came face to face with the sort of individuals you see in this thread for example, during my University years. As I mentioned in my previous posting those were the 60s when Vietnam, Cuba, the Cold War etc were hot topics and for us in South America a matter of life and death. I was staunchly anti-Communist (still am) but I couldnt help to see that Vietnam was a horrible tragedy and an unwinnable war and said so to anyone who cared to listen. One of the first things I found out arguing with the Communists was that they would attack your sources of information, which were always printing lies (unless they supported their arguments), they lied because all media was compromised, the Imperialists controlled everything, the CIA was behind every curtain blah blah Only they, the Communists knew what was really happening, they had the monopoly of truth. Another method was the Karl Rove method, the Antonia method, demonize and insult your opponents, any prominent anti-Communist was a f-a-g, a libertine, a liar, corrupt an agent of the CIA etc. When there were debates on TV the Communists used to insult their opponents, spit on them and other niceties. When Allende took power the first thing he did was to clamp on any media outlet that criticised him. You can see the same tactics employed here by some persons: since the Catholic Church opposes abortion anyone who opposes abortion has to be a believer and even if the person is not, some person will I declare you a believer for it suits her agenda. Demonization a la Karl Rove. When one reaches this point in the debate it is time to bid Adios and stop talking with that person, for there is no dialogue at this point. Of course according to zealots no one but them has the right to voice an opinion about the issue being discussed. In Chile I had no right to speak my mind about politics because I was a rich kid out of touch with the lives of the poor, according to the Communists (although all of their leaders came also from affluent families) here I am a man therefore I have no right to voice my opinion on womens issues. Who gave these people the right to assign or deny rights? Another question without an answer. The goal of these people is to shut up and drive away anyone who disagrees with them. Oh, one more thing, whatever they do they accuse the other side of doing, they are the only ones guilty of, such as this: some people can dish it our but cannot take it. Hollyh is the only one here who saw that complex issues have no clear answers and therefore we hold contradictory positions in our minds. I am always an optimist and I always argue in good faith, with a touch of humour, and take other peoples words at face value but soon the zealots with an axe to grind and a big chip on their shoulders begin to swing the axe and it is the end of the conversation. It is OK with me, for forums are not my intellectual life at all. I read newspapers and other sources of info in the Net and to gauge what readers think, I read their letters to the editor.

"12-22-2008","11293",56,"Another opinion","337685","When you say ""fully human"", what do you mean by that? In what way is a zygote or early embryo ""fully human""? I have often found that those on the pro-life side tend to imagine the embryo as the baby it will become, not for what that embryo actually is at that moment. I can understand that emotion, but it is based on imagination, not reality, so one cannot base a law on it. The early fetus / embryo has no mind yet that can feel pain, fear, joy, any will to live, feel any sensory input ...nothing. At that early stage, it is just a body with ""nobody home"". Any movements at that stage are only reflex action - not actions due to a mind controlling that movement or feeling their effect. Our imaginations can deceive us into thinking otherwise since, after all, it starts to ""look"" human fairly early on. It has a heart beat fairly early on and other aspects that make us try to relate to it. However, I find it important to be able to step back and judge objectively whether what one is imagining is actually true. Does the fact that it starts to look like us mean that it really is like us? In the most critical sense, I would say no since it cannot have any sense of mind / mental existence until fairly late in the pregnancy. That mental existence is what makes us us - it is the core aspect of our lives as people that one cannot due without. I, and many others on the pro-choice side, find that dividing line of the onset of potential mental existence as critically important in defining abortion rights. Before that human body gains any mental existence, it is, once again, just a body with ""nobody home"" which many of us view as not deserving rights (mere bodies don't deserve rights) so the woman can abort it at that stage for whatever reason she chooses since her right to her own body is unchallenged by any other right. However, once the fetus can start to have a mental existence (when there is a ""somebody"" now present in the body), then fetal rights to life also have to be taken into account. This happens around the beginning of the third trimester. Because of this, many of us on the pro-choice side would limit third trimester abortion rights to a handful of exceptions (risk to mother's life, health, etc.) but would keep first and second trimester abortions rights free. Indeed, around 84% of Americans think that third trimester abortions should be generally outlawed (generally meaning outlawed minus certain exceptions). Those statistics show that the majority of pro-choice supporters would also generally outlaw third trimester abortions - some for reasons similar to my own, some for reasons of viability or other arguements. Those here that argue the extreme of no restrictions on abortion rights for any reason ever, are definitely the minority with only about 10% of Americans supporting those views. What is also interesting is that about 2/3rds of Americans support first trimester abortions being legal - where those statistics would reveal that a minority of those calling themselves pro-life do support abortion rights if the abortions would happen very early on. So, the two camps are not as extreme as some of the rhethoric in this forum might suggest. The spread also shows that the issues are more complex. Note: The statistics I quote come from Abortion , a CNN/Gallup/USA Today poll from 2003 (the last one I have seen that divides the question into trimesters).","Winston Smith","337727","the problem is that your measuring stick for 'human' is a human being after being born. a human foetus, can only be a 'human' foetus, what else can it be? a dog foetus, a non-human foetus, an extra-terrestial foetus? a human being is always changing from the moment of conception till she/dies to say that a human being can have only the right to live only after a particular arbitrary point in her development was chosen just to justify abortion.

Of course, it is not. I would be pleased if there were almost no abortions. The abortion clinics lie and say they want to reduce the number of abortions. First of all, why do they even say that when they think it is no big deal? Secondly, if they really wanted to reduce the numbers then there are things which would be effective to that end. However, they do things which increase the numbers. On the other hand, I, and others like me are focused on solutions to reduce the number of women who feel like they have no other choice than to kill their own children.

"12-23-2008","11293",56,"nononsense","337636","Who makes the laws? Congress. When Roe is overturned based on the fact that, first of all, it is unconstitutional, secondly, it contradicts itself and implies a pneumbra for women but not for children. Finally, Blackmun skirted around the truth of when human life begins, thus committing an egregious error in his opinion. Good people change bad laws, and we will overturn Roe v Wade. We never advocate a nanny state, but a state which protects not only some lives but all lives....after all, it is an inalienable right. We will do what we have been doing, but on a grander scale. We will fund only clinics which are effective in keeping young girls and women healthy. We will provide education on healthy living. We will provide services and help for those needing help with their babies. We will place babies in homes waiting to adopt. As for the law, it will operate like every other piece of legislation. Doctors are to do no harm, and will live up to that expectation. Anyone providing an illegal abortion will face legal action. You stupidly act like every law breaker in the world will be proscecuted, when you know that is never the case. As for abortions (legal) causing harm to a woman, that is still the case today. Planned Parenthood has been the cause of many damaged uteruses, caused many to become infertile, and has caused deaths due to their so-called ""safe abortions."" The more cases there are the more chance for damage and death. Women who abort may not always nor immediately suffer, but they will in time. It is ironic that abortion is sold as a way to relieve women from harmful conseqences and billed as something which never harms women, while it hurts every woman, child and family it touches. Physicians know and believe that life begins at conception. Many testified before congress.... In the words of Dr. Lejeune: ""Each of us has a very precise starting moment which is the time at which the whole necessary and sufficient genetic information is gathered inside one cell, the fertilized egg, and this is the moment of fertilization. There is not the slightest doubt about that and we know that this information is written on a kind of ribbon which we call the DNANature has used the smallest possible language to carry the information from father to children, from mother to children, from generation to generationAt no time is the human being a blob of protoplasm. As far as your nature is concerned, I see no difference between the early person that you were at conception and the late person which you are now. You were and are a human being."" This is an excerpt from a thouroughly researched and thought out argument against Roe. If any of you are interested in actual facts: Recall the 1857 Dred Scott v. Sanford decision, which declared that slavery could not be prohibited by Congress in any territory of the U.S. and that African Americans were not full persons and not afforded the same rights as ""full persons."" Sound familiar? President Lincoln argued that the slaves were persons, not possessions, and that their unalienable right to liberty was protected by the Declaration of Independence unborn. To add to the irony, after the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, came the Thirteenth (1865) and Fourteenth (1868) Amendments, all which overthrew slavery and the erroneous Dred Scott Supreme Court decision. The Fourteenth Amendment...how ironic. One of the Amendments which helped overturn Dred Scott is now used to further the ""non-person"" argument -the same argument the Amendment was created to prevent! How can the Supreme Court use the Fourteenth Amendment to help justify denying the unborn unalienable rights when this Amendment was supposed to protect people from such selective rights attribution?
