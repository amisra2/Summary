               Coma patients still have brain waves - they are just reduced compared to normal and are not conscious. I never required consciousness as a criteria for our existence. If I did, then quote me. When we are asleep, we still mentally exist. Our cerebral cortex largely determines our mental existence so, once it is sufficiently destroyed to no longer function, then we no longer exist and, before it is sufficiently developed, we don't yet exist.

           Then if I can show that fetuses learn in the womb, and dream in the womb will you change your opinion of their fight to be protected in the womb? Consider this if you will:

                our Intelligent Fetuses
                <br/>
                By Soumy Ana.  August 2003- Rajab 1424
                <br/>
                --------------------------------------------
                <br/>
                Twins have been seen developing certain gestures and habits at twenty weeks
                <br/>
                gestational age which persist into their postnatal years, such as games that they would
                <br/>
                typically play in the womb with a membrane separating the both of them.
                <br/>
                Fetuses quickly learn kicking anywhere on cue.
                <br/>
                The mother’s voice rhythm is repeated by the baby or can be used to stimulate feeding.
                <br/>
                Babies are leaning their native language before birth from 16 weeks gestation on. The proof
                <br/>
                is that they prefer looking at people using this language.
                <br/>
                Researchers discovered the presence of chemosensory receptors in utero. Many chemical
                <br/>
                compounds, including those from the mother's diet, pass through the placenta and reach the
                <br/>
                baby in utero while others flow in the capillaries of the nasal mucosa. By breathing and
                <br/>
                swallowing amniotic fluid, a baby becomes familiar with the mother's diet, including things
                <br/>
                like garlic. Even before post-nasal exposure to breast milk, babies already know and prefer
                <br/>
                their own mother's milk. They can smell it! Smell does not need air to spread!
                <br/>
                Traumatic events can happen at birth and stay with the child its entire life like the fear of
                <br/>
                adhesive tape if it is linked to pain or fear at the time of the birth.
                <br/>
                Unborn babies participate in their mother’s emotional upset, especially when she is watching
                <br/>
                a movie. And babies whose mother experienced depression during pregnancy themselves
                <br/>
                display signs of depression at birth.
                <br/>
                All of this proves that memory and learning are a normal behavior of the unborn child and the
                <br/>
                human being. Education begins in the womb and continues in life.
                <br/>
                Being in the womb, the fetus is constantly stimulated by what is going on around it.  The fetus is
                <br/>
                even more vulnerable because it grows billions of brain cells that are on their way to be
                <br/>
                programmed for future life outside the womb.
                <br/>
                We have to think that this growing organism is an individual with its own personality and its own
                <br/>
                hearing and feeling apparatus.
                <br/>
                Fetus and personality:
                <br/>
                After three months, babies show signs of personality; one fetus behaves differently from
                <br/>
                another in the womb, already showing if it will be active or not, how curious it is and how open to
                <br/>
                the world outside.
                <br/>
                Prenates choose the way they are lying in the womb and they “decide” the time of labor by
                <br/>
                releasing protein in the mother’s blood stream. Many babies presenting in the breach position just
                <br/>
                before labor have been convinced by their mothers to turn and shift in a way it would facilitate
                <br/>
                birth for both of them, showing there is a real communication going on between parents and
                <br/>
                fetuses.
                <br/>
                There is evidence that babies share in their mothers' emotions via the hormones associated with
                <br/>
                them. For centuries many cultures have believed it, and for this reason were cautious to avoid the
                <br/>
                mother any unhappiness or discomfort as well as keeping her pure in body and mind.
                <br/>
                Prenatal researchers believe that there is indeed some connection between what a mother thinks
                <br/>
                and how her baby feels.
                <br/>
                Studies revealed a tendency for anxious mothers to produce anxious babies.
                <br/>
                Mothers who resent being pregnant or feel detached from their babies are more likely to have
                <br/>
                children who will have emotional problems.
                <br/>
                Some children whose mothers were depressed during pregnancy appear to be depressed
                <br/>
                themselves, rarely smiling, sobbing often or not feeding well.
                <br/>
                Preborns register not only the mother’s emotions but the lilt of her voice and the pattern of her
                <br/>
                language and of those talking to her.
                <br/>
                Preborns may be leaning their native language before birth from 16 weeks on, so that by 27
                <br/>
                weeks of gestation, the fetus’ voice already contains some of the speech characteristics of its
                <br/>
                mother. [1]
                <br/>
                Preborns also use their memory actively.
                <br/>
                A study by Donald Shelter, professor of education at the University of Rochester's Eastman
                <br/>
                School of Music, shows that fetuses can remember wordless tunes, no matter how complex. [2]
                <br/>

              As for my having a particular standard, everyone has a right to have their own standard and present their arguements for it. That is a large part of the reason that we are all here in this forum arguing our particular standards. I have as much right to argue for my standard as you have to argue for yours. Many people share my standard. However, the pro-choice group is more diverse than the pro-life group, so you will not find us all having the same standard.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           That's the problem with the natural man Ao, you all have moral and ethical standards that are based on your personal comfort zones but are never based in a higher good that goes beyond your own personal desires. Your complete values system is based on what feels right to your human, and very flawed perspectives.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           And there is nothing diverse at all about the pro-abortionists stance. You all insist that a baby isn't human until you can see it, or by some other arbitrary standard that is intended to justify abortions rather than actually face the truth of the value inherent within each unique unborn child. As an example, I will await your combined condemnation of this evidence I'm providing here. None of you will say hmmm, this demands that we reconsider our stance. You will all just dismiss it out of hand as you will probably attack the source rather than consider the info itself.

               GREAT, another ridiculous, off the wall example. I'll tell you what cake, if you can prove that the child actively and purposely caused his mothers death with malice and forethought, then I would support charging him/her with manslaughter. But it is more likely that the blame should rightfully go to doctor who has a MEDICAL DEGREE and who has been responsible for overseeing her pregnancy throughout her complete gestation period. Can you think of any other example when the patient, which the unborn baby must be viewed as in this case, would be held responsible for a death of the other patient being treated?

           Manslaughter doesn't have to be committed as an act of "malice" or "forethought", it can be completely accidental.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Also, a medical degree can never fully prepare a doctor for the death of a patient. Nor are they responsible for completely natural complications. You wouldn't convict a doctor for manslaughter if his patient died of cancer. You would, however, blame the condition that caused the death. For purposes of this discussion, that would be pregnancy.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           And yes, there are plenty of other examples of a patient being held responsible for another patient's death. If two people are injured in a car crash but one of them very obviously caused the crash (let's just say that he was drunk for arguments sake and smashed into the second vehicle) that person would be responsible.

           True, so why would you charge the baby for an accident which he had nothing to do with causing? It isn't as if his life wasn't in the same danger as the mother, is it?

           Regarding the bolded, of course the medical degree prepares the dr for taking full responsibility for any natural, or expected complications that can arise during the pregnancy. That is the point of medical school, to prepare him/her for every possible contingency.
           <br/>

           And regarding your comparison of pregnancy to cancer; one is a deadly disease that kills if left untreated while the other is a completely natural condition that leads to the continued propagation of the human species if allowed to continue in 98% of all cases. Statistically the exact opposite outcome of cancer. So why would you use such a corrupted comparative example unless you want to compare new life to a deadly disease?

              And yes, there are plenty of other examples of a patient being held responsible for another patient's death. If two people are injured in a car crash but one of them very obviously caused the crash (let's just say that he was drunk for arguments sake and smashed into the second vehicle) that person would be responsible.

           So you're comparing the conscious act of drinking then driving with an unborn child who made no initial decision to even be conceived? And you're trying to hold him responsible for any complications that may arise in a pregnancy that he had no control in overseeing? In your mind, the woman, who did control the process of conception and did control the process of gestation is in no way responsible for any negative outcome at all?
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Tell me cake, is it the goal of todays women to always place responsibility for every action they commit on someone other than themselves? You are using the same rationalization that you use to justify abortion here. It's as if every woman can kill their unborn children without consequence because you would have us believe that they played no part in their conception at all. You have compared being pregnant to a disease, and you have blamed the unborn child for any risks that might exist in pregnancy as if they caused it. Is there no situation that you are willing to hold the responsible women culpable for? Or will you always blame the only innocent party in this pregnancy, that being the child.

               Regarding the bolded, of course the medical degree prepares the dr for taking full responsibility for any natural, or expected complications that can arise during the pregnancy. That is the point of medical school, to prepare him/her for every possible contingency.

           You have obviously met very few doctors. There is no way that someone can be ready for "every possible contingency" as real life certainly doesn't run like a medical text book. Some things are simply out of the doctor's hands.

           You seem to take some things too literally. I was merely stating that in any other case, the medical condition that the patient had would be considered the cause of death - not their doctor.

           You asked for an example of one patient being convicted for the death of another, I gave you one. Also, though the baby wouldn't have killed the mother with intention, the child still would have been the cause regardless in whether they had a choice or not. I'm simply following your logic, Archie, that if a foetus is to be given human rights it should also be subject to human accountability.

           Woah, where did that come from? I had no idea that this would turn into a misogynist rant with no mention of fathers making the same decisions
           <i>
            with
           </i>
           their partner. You're taking my points to extremes and twisting them into things that I did not say. I never claimed that women had no part in a child's conception, I simply assumed that you knew that a dead woman could hardly be held accountable for her own childbirth killing her. I compared a doctor's role in childbirth with that of a cancer patient in that some things cannot be helped nor foreseen by medical treatment. I certainly did not blame an unborn child for all complications or risks in the childbirth process, just some of them. If a woman drinks and smokes throughout her pregnancy, for example, it's her own decision but she's got to accept that something may very well go wrong.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Please, never put words that I did not say in my mouth.

               Woah, where did that come from? I had no idea that this would turn into a misogynist rant with no mention of fathers making the same decisions
               <i>
                with
               </i>
               their partner. You're taking my points to extremes and twisting them into things that I did not say. I never claimed that women had no part in a child's conception, I simply assumed that you knew that a dead woman could hardly be held accountable for her own childbirth killing her. I compared a doctor's role in childbirth with that of a cancer patient in that some things cannot be helped nor foreseen by medical treatment. I certainly did not blame an unborn child for all complications or risks in the childbirth process, just some of them. If a woman drinks and smokes throughout her pregnancy, for example, it's her own decision but she's got to accept that something may very well go wrong.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Please, never put words that I did not say in my mouth.

           There is nothing at all that is misogynistic about my summation of your argument. After all, even the husband of the wife who chooses to abort her child has no legal say in that decision to save the child's life. He can be held legally responsible for supporting a child which he doesn't want, but has no say at all in preserving the life of the child he does want if the woman decides otherwise. How is that fair or right cake?
           <br/>
           <br/>
           And again, you seem to be blind to how women have it there way under all possible scenarios. But in typical fashion you rely on the old standby that I must be a misogynist if I dare hold women responsible for the incredibly unfair and hypocritical reality that is rife with double standards that work against any man who wishes to do the responsible thing, as the LAW supports the woman no matter how irresponsible or selfish the motivation for the decisions she makes are, regarding the life of the child the man was equally responsible for creating. It makes no rational sense at all, but let's hear you defend it as I'm sure you will.

               This link deals with fetal pain and evidence that it is evident in the unborn.

           The evidence they present is pretty flimsy. Reviews I have read by groups of scientists assembled to investigate issues such as fetal pain conclude that the cerebral cortex has to be developed enough to actually cause an experience of pain. Before that, fetuses can react, but it is reflex action - not something actually perceived. Many other actions caused by reflex actions or purely chemical means can also be misinterpreted, as seems to be the case for most of the first part of your post. I trust that the science can best determine the state of development necessary for pain, cognition, etc., and that the current scientific consensus is the correct one until  and unless someone can come up with results that refute that consensus and still stand up to scrutiny. That doesn't seem to be the case.

               That's the problem with the natural man Ao, you all have moral and ethical standards that are based on your personal comfort zones but are never based in a higher good that goes beyond your own personal desires. Your complete values system is based on what feels right to your human, and very flawed perspectives.

           If I only cared about my own good, then I would cheat, steal and otherwise hurt people in all situations that I could get away with, and otherwise cause whatever mayhem would benefit me. That is far from the case. Just because my morality is not based on religion doesn't mean that it is based on selfishness. My morality is based on taking a rational objective look at the world and coupling that rational analyis with a generally approach of trying to treat others as I would myself expect to be treated if I were in their shoes. Where abortion is concerned, by reciprocity, I think my mother should have had every right to abort me up to the time that I started to have a mental existence. Sure I am glad she did not, but I am also glad that she didn't use contraceptives, or anything else that would have stopped my coming into existence.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           The trouble with those who are strongly religious is that they often do not take a rational objective look at the world but automatically assume that whatever they are told is correct. Many might have good intentions, but if they don't view the world as it really is, then those good intentions might do more harm than good. Otherwise, many who are strongly religious proclaim certain moral rules without presenting all the rational reasons behind those rules.

               And there is nothing diverse at all about the pro-abortionists stance. You all insist that a baby isn't human until you can see it, or by some other arbitrary standard that is intended to justify abortions rather than actually face the truth of the value inherent within each unique unborn child. As an example, I will await your combined condemnation of this evidence I'm providing here. None of you will say hmmm, this demands that we reconsider our stance. You will all just dismiss it out of hand as you will probably attack the source rather than consider the info itself.

           First, the evidence presented was very sketchy, without detail. Second, it seemed to be full of misinterpretations that have already been refuted by scientists knowledgible in the field - such as the fact that early movement is based on reflex action, and that not all brain waves indicate any level of thought or mental existence - only the higher level brain waves that emerge late in the pregnancy.

               First, the evidence presented was very sketchy, without detail. Second, it seemed to be full of misinterpretations that have already been refuted by scientists knowledgible in the field - such as the fact that early movement is based on reflex action, and that not all brain waves indicate any level of thought or mental existence - only the higher level brain waves that emerge late in the pregnancy.

           And yet you didn't see fit to offer even one link to support your claim. Why is it that I must always provide evidence for what I say, yet when I do, your side responds with how flimsy my evidence is, but I'm to just accept your opinionated claims? What makes your opinion more valid than my linked evidence Ao? I'll tell you what, NOTHING AT ALL. And what's wrong with evidence from the AMERICAN PAIN SOCIETY?

           Is that not a specialized enough organization for you regarding a fetus ability to feel pain? I mean, all they do is study pain as it applies to human beings. What could I have been thinking by using such a flimsy source?

              This view is not widely accepted, however, and is rejected by Fitzgerald herself. Prior to 26 weeks, the thalamocortical fibers have not yet penetrated the cortical plate, and it seems unlikely the cortical structures considered necessary for pain are responding to noxious stimulation (Mrzljak, Uylings, Kostovic, &amp; van Eden, 1988).

              Pain experience is now widely seen as a consequence of an amalgam of cognition, sensation, and affective processes, commonly described under the rubric of the biopsychosocial model of pain. Pain is no longer regarded as merely a physical sensation of noxious stimulus and disease, but is seen as a conscious experience that may be modulated by mental, emotional, and sensory mechanisms with sensory and emotional components. The biopsychosocial concept emphasizes the multidimensional nature of illness, injury, and pain, rather than emphasizing pain as a purely physical fact of illness or injury. Pain has been described as a multidimensional phenomena for some time (Melzack &amp; Casey, 1968), and this understanding is reflected in the current IASP definition of pain as “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage” (Merskey, 1991).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              If this ‘multidimensionality’ is the basis of conscious pain experience, it seems unlikely we can attribute this experience to the neonate or unborn fetus, which is naive to the cognitive, affective, and evaluative experiences necessary for pain awareness. This is accepted in the current definition of pain, which is further expanded to state, “Pain is always subjective. Each individual learns the application of the word through experiences related to injury in early life.” Pain does not, so to speak, spring forth from the depths of the person’s mind prior to any experience, but is gradually formed as a consequence of general conscious development.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Interestingly, even those authors who support a concept of fetal pain tend to back away when confronted with the need to explain pain phenomenology. Giannakoulopoulos et al (1994), for example, distanced themselves from any implied fetal pain experience with the statement, “a hormonal response cannot be equated with the perception of pain.” Lloyd-Thomas and Fitzgerald (1996) have suggested if feeling and pain are properly understood, the fetus cannot be said to feel pain.

             The New England Journal of Medicine ran an editorial calling on clinicians to &#8220;Do the right thing,&#8221; concluding, &#8220;it is our responsibility to treat pain in neonates and infants as effectively as we do in other patients&#8221; (Rogers, 1992). Since then, it has become normal practice to assume neonates feel pain, and this has inevitably led to speculation that the fetus may also experience pain (Anand &amp; Hickey, 1987; Giannakoulopoulos, Sepulveda, Kourtis, Glover, &amp; Fisk, 1994; Richards, 1985). Discussion of fetal pain has attracted the attention of the media and governments because of links to abortion practice (Derbyshire, 1999). This year, the Minnesota Senate enacted legislation requiring physicians to inform women of the possibility of fetal pain prior to performing abortions (Minnesota Senate Bill 187). This article evaluates the evidence for and against fetal and neonatal pain, considering the implications for current clinical practice (other than abortion), and the contemporary understanding of pain.

             <font color="DarkRed">
              Further support comes from the work of Fitzgerald (1987, 1994), who has reviewed the biological development of the fetus and examined the possibility of fetal pain at each stage of development.
              <b>
               At 7.5 weeks&#8217; gestation, reflex responses to somatic stimuli begin, and touching the perioral region results in a contralateral bending of the head. The palms of the hands become sensitive to stroking at 10.5 weeks, and the rest of the body and hindlimbs become sensitive at approximately 13.5 weeks. Shortly after the development of sensitivity, repeated skin stimulation results in hyperexcitability and a generalized movement of all limbs. This hyperexcitability has been interpreted as evidence for the presence of a functional pain system, reflecting an immature but intact pain response with early hypersensitivity to stimulation (Barr, 1994).
              </b>
              This view is not widely accepted, however, and is rejected by Fitzgerald herself. Prior to 26 weeks, the thalamocortical fibers have not yet penetrated the cortical plate, and it seems unlikely the cortical structures considered necessary for pain are responding to noxious stimulation (Mrzljak, Uylings, Kostovic, &amp; van Eden, 1988).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              The evidence for cortical involvement post-26 weeks is enhanced by behavioral studies that have demonstrated focused and organized responses to noxious stimulation that can be better discriminated from other distress responses (Craig, Whitfield, Grunau, Linton, &amp; Hadjistavropoulos, 1993). As with the hormonal response to surgery, the behavioral responses can be reduced with the use of appropriate anesthetic (Fitzgerald, Millard, &amp; McIntosh, 1989).
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <b>
               Having established the necessary neurobiology for pain is in place and that behavioral responses to noxious stimulation are present in premature babies of approximately 26 weeks gestation, it is logical to suggest a fetus of at least 26 weeks&#8217; gestation will respond similarly to invasive practice as observed in neonates undergoing surgery.
              </b>
              Giannakoulopoulos et al. (1994) from the Queen Charlottes Hospital in London, England, successfully demonstrated intrauterine needling to obtain blood samples from fetuses at 20 to 34 weeks&#8217; gestation results in a hormonal stress response. They demonstrated that needling the innervated intraabdominal portion of the umbilical vein, rather than the placental cord (which is not innervated) resulted in increased cortisol and b-endorphin concentrations in fetal plasma. If this group or others can demonstrate the hormonal and neural &#8220;stress response&#8221; can be prevented with the use of appropriate anesthetics, they will have mirrored the criteria that have led to the widespread acceptance of &#8220;neonatal pain.&#8221;

           Like any objective source, this link gives both sides of the issue. So your posting the other side does nothing to nullify the fact that evidence exists that fetuses feel pain at 26 weeks or even less possibly, according to the bolded info above. And the point is that if fetuses feel pain, and if they dream, then they have thoughts at some level.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Nobody would claim that fetuses experience stimuli exactly as we do as adults. I remember being a child and being so sensitive to hot water that my mother washed the dishes with and soaked her hands in. I marveled at how she handled hot temperatures. But today, my Jacuzzi is set at 107 degrees when the directions recommend between 101 and 103. The higher temp is nothing to me now, but do you think we would stick a baby in that water? The point I'm attempting to make is that if anything, fetuses are more sensitive to stimuli than we are. This is further proven by premies who can't even be touched by nurses for at least 2 months because their nerve endings are so raw until they develop further.

               So if my link say's something you agree with, it isn't so sketchy all of a sudden huh? Well it also say's this Ao.

           The quotes that you showed in your first post on the subject - post #31 - were indeed all sketchy. The third link that you never quoted from until your most recent post does have a mixture of results. So, lets analyze some of them:
           <br/>
           <div style="margin-left:40px">
            <font size="2">
             The New England Journal of Medicine ran an editorial calling on clinicians to “Do the right thing,” concluding, “it is our responsibility to treat pain in neonates and infants as effectively as we do in other patients” (Rogers, 1992). Since then, it has become normal practice to assume neonates feel pain, and this has inevitably led to speculation that the fetus may also experience pain (Anand &amp; Hickey, 1987; Giannakoulopoulos, Sepulveda, Kourtis, Glover, &amp; Fisk, 1994; Richards, 1985). Discussion of fetal pain has attracted the attention of the media and governments because of links to abortion practice (Derbyshire, 1999). This year, the Minnesota Senate enacted legislation requiring physicians to inform women of the possibility of fetal pain prior to performing abortions (Minnesota Senate Bill 187). This article evaluates the evidence for and against fetal and neonatal pain, considering the implications for current clinical practice (other than abortion), and the contemporary understanding of pain.
            </font>
           </div>
           No one here is claiming that no fetuses experience pain. The question that science has been challenged to answer is when fetuses can first start experiencing pain. There, a concensus has generally formed that it is quite late in pregnancy - when cortical connections and the cerebral cortex is further developed. Even then, it is not certain whether pain can be felt before consciousness. As for media and politics, history has proven time and again that media and politics often act quite independently of any scientific evidence. The media and politicians are far from experts and far from being objective judges.
           <br/>
           <div style="margin-left:40px">
            <font size="2">
             Further support comes from the work of
             <b>
              Fitzgerald
             </b>
             (1987, 1994), who has reviewed the biological development of the fetus and examined the possibility of fetal pain at each stage of development. At 7.5 weeks’ gestation, reflex responses to somatic stimuli begin, and touching the perioral region results in a contralateral bending of the head. The palms of the hands become sensitive to stroking at 10.5 weeks, and the rest of the body and hindlimbs become sensitive at approximately 13.5 weeks. Shortly after the development of sensitivity, repeated skin stimulation results in hyperexcitability and a generalized movement of all limbs. This hyperexcitability has been interpreted as evidence for the presence of a functional pain system, reflecting an immature but intact pain response with early hypersensitivity to stimulation (Barr, 1994).
             <b>
              This view is not widely accepted, however, and is rejected by Fitzgerald herself. Prior to 26 weeks, the thalamocortical fibers have not yet penetrated the cortical plate, and it seems unlikely the cortical structures considered necessary for pain are responding to noxious stimulation (Mrzljak, Uylings, Kostovic, &amp; van Eden, 1988).
             </b>
            </font>
           </div>
           As can be seen by the bolded statements, the very person who conducted that research that you quote here rejects the theory that early fetuses can feel pain.
           <br/>
           <div style="margin-left:40px">
            <font size="2">
             The evidence for cortical involvement post-26 weeks is enhanced by behavioral studies that have demonstrated focused and organized responses to noxious stimulation that can be better discriminated from other distress responses (Craig, Whitfield, Grunau, Linton, &amp; Hadjistavropoulos, 1993). As with the hormonal response to surgery, the behavioral responses can be reduced with the use of appropriate anesthetic (Fitzgerald, Millard, &amp; McIntosh, 1989).
             <br/>
             <br/>
             Having established the necessary neurobiology for pain is in place and that behavioral responses to noxious stimulation are present in premature babies of approximately 26 weeks gestation, it is logical to suggest a fetus of at least 26 weeks’ gestation will respond similarly to invasive practice as observed in neonates undergoing surgery. Giannakoulopoulos et al. (1994) from the Queen Charlottes Hospital in London, England, successfully demonstrated intrauterine needling to obtain blood samples from fetuses at 20 to 34 weeks’ gestation results in a hormonal stress response. They demonstrated that needling the innervated intraabdominal portion of the umbilical vein, rather than the placental cord (which is not innervated) resulted in increased cortisol and b-endorphin concentrations in fetal plasma. If this group or others can demonstrate the hormonal and neural “stress response” can be prevented with the use of appropriate anesthetics, they will have mirrored the criteria that have led to the widespread acceptance of “neonatal pain.”

           </div>
           This shows hormonal reaction, which most scientists claim doesn't by itself show the experience of pain. Either way, this talks about post 26 week fetuses - i.e. the same late term fetuses that I do accept as having the possibility of having a mental existence. It does NOT speak of early term fetuses and embryos.

               Like any objective source, this link gives both sides of the issue. So your posting the other side does nothing to nullify the fact that evidence exists that fetuses feel pain at 26 weeks or even less possibly, according to the bolded info above. And the point is that if fetuses feel pain, and if they dream, then they have thoughts at some level.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Nobody would claim that fetuses experience stimuli exactly as we do as adults. I remember being a child and being so sensitive to hot water that my mother washed the dishes with and soaked her hands in. I marveled at how she handled hot temperatures. But today, my Jacuzzi is set at 107 degrees when the directions recommend between 101 and 103. The higher temp is nothing to me now, but do you think we would stick a baby in that water? The point I'm attempting to make is that if anything, fetuses are more sensitive to stimuli than we are. This is further proven by premies who can't even be touched by nurses for at least 2 months because their nerve endings are so raw until they develop further.

           Again, if we are speaking of late term fetuses, then I agree that there is the possibility that they feel pain. For late term fetuses, the scientific community still seems undecided - some arguments for and some against. As I have always said, for late term fetuses, they might have mental existence (which includes the possibility of experiencing pain) so I would limit late term abortion rights. The abortions in question are for first trimester or early to mid second trimester abortions (anything prior to late second trimester). For that state of development, you have yet to show evidence that fetuses and embryos experience pain.

               The pro-life argument most certainly does NOT rest on potentialities.  It is strong for the sheer fact that the moment the sperm fertilizes the egg, a new human life is created.  It is life right there and then, regardless of what becomes of it later.  The reason you'll hear pro-lifers emphasize growth is because, after conception, that is all that takes place -growth of a human being, NOT the beginning of a human being.
               <br/>
               It is the pro-choice argument which deals more with potential.  It must determine an arbitrary point in the growth of the child that it can actually be called a child.  When the heart starts beating?  When you can see fingers and toes?  When the fetus is able to feel pain?  When it finally emerges from the birth canal?  Can you tell me for certain when a new life exists?  There is no definitive beginning except at conception.

           Yes. The fertilized egg is sacred. It is God. Worship it.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Women are only humble vessels for these gods. Women have no other use for being.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Of course, once outside the womb, who cares what happens. Let the newborn starve, or be bombed into oblivion. It is no longer a god.

              No one here is claiming that no fetuses experience pain. The question that science has been challenged to answer is when fetuses can first start experiencing pain.
              <b>
               There, a concensus has generally formed that it is quite late in pregnancy - when cortical connections and the cerebral cortex is further developed.
              </b>
              Even then, it is not certain whether pain can be felt before consciousness. As for media and politics, history has proven time and again that media and politics often act quite independently of any scientific evidence. The media and politicians are far from experts and far from being objective judges.
             </div>
            </div>
           </div>
           That isn't the consensus at all Ao. In fact current info is accepting the opposite conclusion. Here's an excerpt from the link.
           <br/>

               Ultrasonographic findings report specific fetal movements in response to needle punctures in utero (Robinson &amp; Smotherman, 1992; Sival 1993).
               <b>
                Moreover, a controlled study of intrauterine blood sampling and blood transfusions in fetuses between 20 and 34 weeks of gestation showed that hormonal responses that were consistent with fetal perception of pain, and were correlated with the duration of the painful stimulus
               </b>
               (Giannakoulopuolos et al, 1994).
               <br/>
               <br/>
               <b>
                Preterm neonates born at 23 weeks gestation show highly specific and well-coordinated physiologic and behavioral responses to pain, similar to those seen in full-term neonates, older infants, and small children (Pain in Neonates,
               </b>
               Anand &amp; McGrath, 1993).
               <br/>
               <u>
                All of the scientific references I have just made, are from research breakthroughs in the last 10 years. This information was not available in 1973.
               </u>
               As a result of this newly emerging understanding of fetal pain development, Anand and Craig, in a 1996 Editorial in the Journal PAIN, called for a new definition of Pain, a definition that is not subjective, and that is not dependent on the patient's ability to provide a self-report.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               2. Increased sensitivity to pain in preterm infants
               <br/>
               <br/>
               <font size="5">
                <b>
                 Contrary to previous teaching, current data indicate that preterm neonates have greater pain sensitivity than term neonates or older age groups. Several lines of scientific evidence support this concept.
                </b>
               </font>
              </font>
             </font>
            </span>

           </a>
           <br/>
           <br/>
           And let's not lose sight of the focus of this info. It is given as evidence of how early infants feel and therefore should be considered people with rights and protections against being aborted. The ability to feel pain is one of the criteria for sentience and add to the the eye flutter of young fetuses that show they dream while sleeping, and any reasonable doubts you are left with should lean in favor of the child just for the sake of humanity.

               And let's not lose sight of the focus of this info. It is given as evidence of how early infants feel and therefore should be considered people with rights and protections against being aborted. The ability to feel pain is one of the criteria for sentience and add to the the eye flutter of young fetuses that show they dream while sleeping, and any reasonable doubts you are left with should lean in favor of the child just for the sake of humanity.

           So, you are now refuting the first link that you mentioned - the one that we both agreed was from a seemingly reliable source, the American Pain Society? Remember, YOU were the one who introduced that link. Do you no longer consider it reliable since it turns out to mainly argue against early fetal pain?
           <br/>
           <br/>
           As for this new link, it is from one individual's testimony before congress. It does not represent a consensus of scientists and does not address the arguements that most scientists have about the cerebral cortex needing to be involved (meaning that, with late development of the cerebral cortex, pain could only be felt in late pregnancy). Remember, just because some of the parts necessary for pain reception are there, that doesn't mean that everything is in place for the fetus to experience pain.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           Instead of listening to only one scientist's voice, who can pick and choose his prefered results depending on his biases, I put much more trust in conclusions reached by groups of scientists - where most such personal biases can be averaged out. There haven't been many organized groups of scientists or comprehensive reviews of scientific literature, but the ones that I have come across all seem to support fetal pain only in late pregnancy:

           Here is one from the Journal of the American Medical Association -

              Evidence Acquisition
             </u>
            </b>
            Systematic search of PubMed for English-language articles focusing on human studies related to fetal pain, anesthesia, and analgesia. Included articles studied fetuses of less than 30 weeks&#8217; gestational age or specifically addressed fetal pain perception or nociception. Articles were reviewed for additional references. The search was performed without date limitations and was current as of June 6, 2005.

              Evidence Synthesis
             </u>
            </b>
            Pain perception requires conscious recognition or awareness of a noxious stimulus. Neither withdrawal reflexes or hormonal stress responses to invasive procedures prove the existence of fetal pain, because they can be elicited by nonpainful stimuli and occur without conscious cortical processing. Fetal awareness of noxious stimuli requires functional thalamocortical connections. Thalamocortical fibers begin appearing between 23 to 30 weeks&#8217; gestational age, while troencephalography suggests the capacity for functional pain perception in preterm neonates probably does not exist before 29 or 30 weeks. For fetal surgery, women may receive general anesthesia and/or analgesics intended for placental transfer, and parenteral opioids may be administered to the fetus under direct or sonographic visualization. In these circumstances, administration of anesthesia and analgesia serves purposes unrelated to reduction of fetal pain, including inhibition of fetal movement, prevention of fetal hormonal stress responses, and induction of uterine atony.
            <br/>
            <b>
             <u>
              Conclusions
             </u>
            </b>
            Evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that
            <b>
             <font color="Red">
              fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester
             </font>
            </b>
            . Little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques. Similarly, limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion. Anesthetic techniques currently used during fetal surgery are not directly applicable to abortion procedures.

           Another is from the British Medical Association (BMA), referencing, among other things, a full inquiry that was made by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The BMA concludes (from
           <a href="http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/Content/AbortionTimeLimits~Factors~pain" target="_blank">
            http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/Content...s~Factors~pain

           <br/>
           <div style="margin-left:40px">
            Interpretation of the evidence on fetal pain is conflicting, with some arguing that the fetus has the potential to experience pain at ten weeks&#8217; gestation, others arguing that this stage is not reached until 26 weeks&#8217; gestation (see below) and still others arguing for some unspecified gestational period in between,  for example 17 weeks.
            <b>
             It has been argued, however, that those who adopt a stage early in fetal development confuse the notion of pain &#8211; as an experience &#8211; with reflex or hormonal 'stress' responses.
            </b>
            The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, following a detailed review of the evidence, argued that there is no possibility of fetal awareness before 26 weeks:
            <br/>
            <br/>
            'It is possible by direct means to identify the minimum stage of structural development that is necessary &#8211; but not that which is sufficient &#8211; to confer awareness upon the developing fetus.
            <b>
             This minimum stage of development, with structural integration of peripheral nerves, spinal cord, brain stem, thalamus and, finally, the cerebral cortex, has not begun before 26 weeks&#8217; gestation.
            </b>
            '
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Although debate continues about whether, and if so when, the fetus can experience pain,
            <b>
             <font color="Red">
              current mainstream professional guidance suggests that a fetus cannot begin to have the possibility of experiencing pain until after 26 weeks&#8217; gestation
             </font>
            </b>
            . This view is reflected in practical guidance on the use of analgesia during invasive procedures carried out on the fetus in utero. The BMA&#8217;s view is that even if there is no incontrovertible evidence that fetuses experience pain, the use of pain relief, when carrying out invasive procedures, may help to relieve the anxiety of the parents and of health professionals.
           </div>
           <br/>
           Again, it is more important what the scientific community concludes than what an individual scientist claims, since you will never have ALL scientists agreeing on the subject. If you can find a link that shows the conclusion of such a consortium of scientists from a non-biased organization (i.e. not politically motivated or sponsored in either the pro-life or pro-choice sides), that also addresses the arguements that cortical connections are necessary, then it might be evidence worth exploring.
