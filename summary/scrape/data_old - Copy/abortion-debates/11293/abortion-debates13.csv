"08-19-2008","11293",13,"Galactababe","320787","Obviously there are some women who are going to have abortions whether it is legal or illegal. I have proposed making it only legal with heavy fines. Therefore, it remains immoral to have an abortion, however sanitary hospital conditions will be available if they choose to act on their immorality.","Shooterandproud","320798","So, abortion for the rich and the rich only?

The ""victim"" has deprived that ""murderer"" of control of her body and forced her to bear morning sickness and childbearing pains. That sounds like an attack.","Steeeeve","320836","Aside from the fact that a parasite has to be of a different species, this doesn't work because the baby was just as forced to be in that situation.

"08-19-2008","11293",13,"Another opinion","320757","Does that mean that the pro-life side would be willing to keep first trimester abortions legal (the natural result of a vote where 66% believe first trimester abortions should be legal) and not try to circumvent public opinion? I find that hard to believe. Why is it so crazy for people to hold opinions while accepting that others might have other views? Not everyone expects others to bend to their will. The poll didn't address WHY people thought later pregnancy was more significant than early pregnancy when it came to fetal rights. Nevertheless, it is quite significant that the poll consistently showed that fetal development DOES matter. Given the trends in Europe where most Western developed countries set abortion limits somewhere between end of first trimester and end of second trimester, this shows that such a fetal development-dependent stance is quite common. Either way, I agree the question of importance of fetal development would be tricky to phrase perfectly in a poll. Nevertheless, it seems obvious that the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll from 2003 that I quoted (along with its earlier identical polls) show that fetal development DOES matter. The reasons why it matters is an important but secondary question to the fact that fetal development does matter.","Steeeeve","320837","You put in ""and"" in there when you probably shouldn't have. Would pro-life folks be willing to keep first trimester abortions legal...no. Would they try to circumvent public opinion, i'm sure some would but this too is illegitimate. Really my point has nothing to do with public opinion but what the law says. Because it means you are willing to accept what happens and in the abortion debate it makes the least amount of sense because a pro-life person believes two people are involved so to say ""well, let people have their views"" would be to agree you can actually push your view on another person (mother killing child)...which is crazy. It also doesn't show what development matter. Furthermore, development is still inferring although I'd say it is likely. Important for what? Honestly, I'm not worried about polls as I don't feel truth comes from that.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:09 PM","abortion-debates","184"

Poll Shows Majority of Americans Pro-Life, Abortion Issues Helps McCain Over Obama by Steven Ertelt LifeNews.com Editor July 5, 2008 Washington, DC (LifeNews.com) -- A new poll reveals a majority of Americans take a pro-life position on abortion and that pro-life Americans outnumber pro-abortion Americans by a 16 percent margin. The survey also found the issue of abortion gives presidential candidate John McCain an eight point advantage over his pro-abortion rival Barack Obama. Conducted by the Polling Company for National Right to Life, the June 2008 poll finds 54 percent of Americans take one of three pro-life positions on abortion and just 38 percent take a pro-abortion position. Looking at a breakdown of the pro-life side of the equation, 17 percent of those surveyed said they oppose abortions and want them illegal for any reason. Another 12 percent said abortions should only be allowed to save the life of the mother, and 27 percent said abortions should only be allowed in the very rare cases to save the life of the mother or when the woman is a victim of rape or incest. The poll also found 30 percent of voters say that the issue of abortion will affect their vote, with 20 percent of self-identified pro-life voters saying so and only 9 percent of pro-abortion voters saying so. Breaking down the numbers further, 17 percent of voters said they would only vote for a candidate who shares their view on abortion, regardless of that view. Looking at that group, 12 percent said they would only vote for a pro-life candidate and just 4 percent said they would only support a candidate who backs abortion. http://www.lifenews.com/nat4021.html","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:33 AM","abortion-debates","189"

"08-20-2008","11293",13,"Galactababe","320893","Oh stop, Shooterandproud. It certainly doesn't indicate bias by labeling those who, duh, favor the right to have an abortion as pro-abortion. If pro-lifers are anti-abortion then choicers are pro-abortion. Bias has nothing to do with it.","Another opinion","320907","Jumping in to answer this, I have a few arguments against this point. First, any group likes to portray themselves based on what they value. In the pro-life case, you value human life (independent of whether there is ""somebody home"" in that living human body) so you call yourselves pro-life. Pro-choicers value a woman's choice in how her body is treated, so we call ourselves pro-choice. To score political points, opponents sometimes prefer calling a group by the negatives which they view. However, if you are going to rename a group based on what you view as negative, then you have to be accurate. Otherwise, it is simply a lie. From that point of view, the labelling of pro-life advocates as anti-choice is accurate and truthful since pro-life proponents indeed deny a woman a choice of whether to have an abortion. However, the labelling of pro-choice advocates as pro-abortion is innacurate and false since, in my experience, I have never heard of any pro-choice proponent advocating that any woman SHOULD get an abortion. Indeed, most pro-choice proponents would also hope that the number of abortions performed reduces with time but, critically, we would hope that this would be accomplished by fewer women choosing abortion (due to fewer unwanted pregnancies to begin with, or due to better socio-economic conditions letting them keep the baby, etc.). The more accurate renaming would be ""pro-abortion rights"". At least that would be accurate and truthful. Alternatively, one could call us ""anti-embryo rights"" if you want something that sounds negative to some portion of the population. If you think that pro-choice proponents are pro-abortion, meaning that they think that women SHOULD get abortions, then I challenge you to find a quote from a major poster here that suggests that.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:45 PM","abortion-debates","194"
"08-20-2008","11293",13,"None","None","None","Galactababe","320909","Another opinion: Sorry, but yours is a weak, Liberal argument, once again playing the ""negative"" card. Every single choicer in this forum has argued for the right for a woman to choose to have an abortion. That means they are pro-abortion for those who choose it. If they thought abortion was a bad thing, then they wouldn't advocate for a woman to be entitled to have one. Very simple. Pro. And btw, I have no objections to being called anti-abortion (except under previously specified circumstances) I just happened to get a phone call from a pro-life organization conducting a survey. They asked if I was pro-life, pro-choice or somewhere in the middle. I answered somewhere in the middle. It's not often that I am ""somewhere in the middle"" on an issue.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:13 PM","abortion-debates","195"
