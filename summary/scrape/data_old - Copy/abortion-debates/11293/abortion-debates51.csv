"12-20-2008","11293",51,"nononsense","337413","You are quite ignornant on the whole matter of abortion. Women are forced to kill their own children and have them ripped from their womb every day! Pain is a part of life, but premature death does not have to be condoned by a civilized society. Every woman who enters a so-called family planning clinic is lied to about the child she is carrying. She is NOT given ALL the information available today. Therefore, they cannot make a choice. They are coerced. It has been widely reported that the so-called counseling from Planned Parenthood tells the women about ALL OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS THEY CAN DO WITHOUT A BABY. But it is too late. What they need to do is help them with the baby. Stop lying and tell the truth. Truly help instead of hurt.","hollyh","337423","What a load of bull-hockey, your the one showing your ignorance. Women in general majority (I'm sure you could find case of minorities that were though)are not forced to have abortions, you dont hear about women being forced into a room and tied down against their will. Are you then implying that just because they dont agree with your choice they must be ""forced"". Dont kid yourself, the only force going on here would be from most woman who are raped enforcing their legal right to have an abortion. Your comment is very degrading to women, I am a woman and no-one could force me to have an abortion. Are you saying women are incapable of making decisions if they dont align with your religious zealot nature? obviously in your eyes everyone who disagrees with you is either ""forced"", ""ignorant"" or ""lied to"". I believe your the one who is either ignorant or once again intellectually bankrupt. Premature death of what exactly? It seems our civilized societies disagrees with you. Again with the ""they dont agree with me they must be forced, ignorant or lied too""! How about providing proof of your stark claims that planned parenthood defy their legal expectations and present a biased, coerced, incomplete account of the options befalling pregnant women. Are you ignorant of the legal repercussions for such clinics based on the claim you make. The courts would be full of law suits if your suggested theory existed.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:18 AM","abortion-debates","751"

Here is the definition of what love is: 3And though I give all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity (LOVE), it profits me nothing. 4Charity (LOVE) is long suffering and is kind; charity (LOVE) does not envy; charity (LOVE) is not haughty, is not puffed up, 5 Does not behave itself unseemly, does not seek its own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil; 6 Does not rejoice not in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth; 7 LOVE bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. 8 LOVE never fails;.... whether there be knowledge, it will vanish away.

Besides it is irrelevant what I answer, because, once you decide to stick a label on me, that is it, even though the label doesnt stick. An example of this is that although I have clearly stated that I am an agnostic, that I dont believe in the God of the Bible, that my conscience is my moral guide and not a Church, that as far back as in high-school I became convinced that the religion was illogical and had no basis, in spite of all that, --in spite of making clear what my ethos is-- you have the stupidity to say : I declare you a believer.

I believe your the one who is either ignorant or once again intellectually bankrupt. How about learning some vocabulary before you jump on people. The word force includes using pressure on a person because of the implied necessity. Planned Parenthood teaches their councellers of what to say to women. Just like Archangel testified about his experience. forced: Function: adjective Date: circa 1537 1 : compelled by force or necessity : involuntary <a forced landing> 2 : done or produced with effort, exertion, or pressure <a forced laugh> Premature death of what exactly? It seems our civilized societies disagrees with you. The death of a human being. The taking of life no matter the size of the individual. Oh contraire, anarchists, atheists, humansists, eugenicists, and the like promote abortion, they are all religious, and they have destroyed more lives than they have protected. Their beliefs have been proven to be failures. Again with the ""they dont agree with me they must be forced, ignorant or lied too""! I am not making things up, I am listening. I am listening and then speaking. I am speaking and then acting. This has nothing to do with me except that my experience supports the principle of protecting lives.

Abigayle: You see, not only did my baby die in February 2000; a part of me died that day as well. And what promised to be the best thing for me turned out to be the worst. Abortion did not end my pain, it began it. Angie: Once again, mom and dad took me to the abortion clinic. This one was in Indianapolis. I was dropped off at the front door to check in by myself. While they found a parking spot, I was whisked away very quickly to the back........I carried that depression, guilt, and self hate thru my years of new motherhood and marriage. I have 3 beautiful children who now know my story. I divorced their father after a miserable 11 year marriage. Most of the misery was self inflicted as there had been no counseling or forgiveness. Becky: At first I was relieved it was over and felt badly about not having much guilt. Over the years, I have come to regret it immensely and now not a day goes by that I dont think about it in one way or another. Cheryl I just turned 50 and I am tired. I am so tired because I have been running from myself for too long. 34 years and I have just caught up with myself. I got pregnant at the age of 16. My parents forced me into an abortion. The father had been in trouble prior to this and they threatened to have him sent away. They carried guns with them and told me if they ever saw me even talking to him that they would kill him and then themselves. That was the final straw. I could not hurt him or his family anymore. I gave in. He thought that I miscarried. They let me see him again afterward but only if they were in the room with us. I knew that I loved him enough that I had to let him go. He never understood what happened. I told him that when both of my parents were gone that I would explain. I went on to get married and had 2 beautiful children, but one had severe handicaps. I felt that this was my punishment. But why did my daughter have to be punished for my sins? I wanted to confront my parents about what they did to me, but kept putting it off. My daughter was 1 1/2 and my mother died suddenly. I never got to ask her why? I had almost 21 more years with my father and never got the nerve to confront him. When he was diagnosed with cancer, how could I confront a dying man with what he had done to me? At the same time I panicked, knowing the promise that I had made with the father of my lost baby. I lived with the guilt of what I had done alone for years. I finally told a couple of close friends. They would listen and try to understand but didn't really. My husband knew and thought that it was all about the father of the baby. For all those years, I did too. I met with the father of the unborn baby and confessed. I thought that I would feel closure. I didn't. It took telling the baby's father and my dad dying to realize that this pain was about me and all that I had been through. My husband just didn't get it. He heard my words but just didn't listen to and hear my pain. I regret not confronting my parents when they were alive and now it's too late. They died thinking that I was fine and that they did the best thing for me. They were so wrong. I just seemed fine because I got good at it. I wore a mask to hide my pain for 34 years. Listen. Please. There are thousands upon thousands of women who have a message. Please listen to them.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:51 PM","abortion-debates","756"

You take few isolated incidents of women who regretted having an abortion while conveniently ignoring the rest. You use deceptive language while arguing that women are somehow ""forced to kill their own children and have them ripped from their womb every day"". This is quite ironic coming from someone who would force a woman to carry a fetus inside of her for nine months to fulfill your own moral ideals. You use terms like ""forced"" when describing counseling given to women in need when making a difficult choice. You use the word ""children"" to describe fetuses, which not only shows your lack of respect for living human children, but your blatant disregard of scientific fact.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:47 PM","abortion-debates","758"

It is kind of a funny way to put it, but we are animals and we are moral creatures, too (btw, animals apart from humans are rather naturally more moral than ourselves, in a lot of ways). But you know as well as I do that human beings demonstrate the capacity to be monogamous, and, not so. But the frank truth in this is that people can get very hurt. Either way, but of course, more notably in the later respect. Everyone has to figure it out for themselves. But -- do you want to deny that? How this behavior affects others? So I think the article is kind of dumb. At the same time, they are discussing adults in a free society and what they do in the boudoir is their choice and their business. Or who they are lying to and deceiving in their personal lives. Right? And if any given woman is 4 weeks pregnant, do you think you or the government has a right to know that, either?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:53 PM","abortion-debates","759"

There is no point debating with you if you continue along your intellectually bankrupt lines. Firstly i asked you to provide proof/evidence of your claims against planned parenthood. You claim they lie and force women into having abortions. Should i attach a 101 reference guide for sourcing/submitting evidence. Please refer to my post below regarding evidential submissions. Secondly, and once again, i do ask that you read the entire thread before making snatched references to it. Archangel also said this meeting with planned parenthood took place decades ago when he was quiet young. It is not a representation of the present. Um, i know I'm only a brand new law student but posting random, un-sourced, non credible ramblings does not constitute 'proof'. And since you previously accuse planned parenthood of being vastly corrupt in regards to their counselling services you would need to provide evidence suitable of a vast nature. Eg; more than one case reference, possibly a dissertation citing mass evidence/case loads. Here is what wiki had to say on the matter of sourcing evidence, it may help you in future. In general, the most reliable sources are peer-reviewed journals and books published in university presses; university-level textbooks; magazines, journals, and books published by respected publishing houses; and mainstream newspapers. As a rule of thumb, the greater the degree of scrutiny involved in checking facts, analyzing legal issues, and scrutinizing the evidence and arguments of a particular work, the more reliable it is. Academic and peer-reviewed publications are highly valued and usually the most reliable sources in areas where they are available, such as history, medicine and science. Material from reliable non-academic sources may also be used in these areas, particularly if they are respected mainstream publications. The appropriateness of any source always depends on the context. Where there is disagreement between sources, their views should be clearly attributed in the text.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:57 PM","abortion-debates","760"

"12-20-2008","11293",51,"None","None","None","Winston Smith","337502","The crux of the matter when it comes to abortion, is that it is convenient for whatever reasons. The problem arises, the moral problem that is, that what you are terminating is a process that if left to its natural conclusion would have had as a result a newborn human being. Abortion is against the nature of women, to defend it is to defend the antithesis of motherhood. The rationalisation to overcome this moral violation is to say that what one is terminating is not a human being, not a human life but an it. I dont care much for the human race but I do care about suffering and that is why I am opposed to abortions that cause pain and according to the scientists, the feeling of pain begins about the end of the first trimester. If you want to commit murder, at least make sure the victim does not suffer.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:52 PM","abortion-debates","764"
