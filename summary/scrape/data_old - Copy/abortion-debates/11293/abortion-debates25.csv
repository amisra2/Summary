Otherwise it's not a plan at all, merely a dream. As you well know, I don't think there's a problem at all. I think ""unborn child"" is an oxymoron. I think, as apparently you did at one time as well, that no one, NO ONE, not you, not I, not the government, has the right to interfere in any way whatsoever, in a woman's unlimited choice of whether or not to continue a pregnancy. Since you are the one who wants a change in the status quo, the burden falls on you to prove the change you want in necessary, desirable, and practical . If you fail in any one of the three, you lose. Good luck trying.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:48 PM","abortion-debates","361"

If that means leaving you country to find one that will perform it ... so be it. You have to remember alot of citizens hold passports/dual citizenship to other countries. If they have a British passport and fly to London for an abortion then they are protected by British law. Same with the Mexican/Canadians you have living within your land. I understand you side Archangel, but i do wonder what would happen to the proposed 1 million unwanted children. Who will care (yes health care inclusive) shelter, protect, raise, fund... them, and not just from birth but here on in? I'm cringing from a social services perspective Its not enough to impose laws such as this without considering the aftermath. I did have one question regarding your one abortion policy, whilst actually quiet good in theory, how would it pertain to all the woman whose second abortion was needed as a result of extreme circumstances? would their be an exception for them?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:29 PM","abortion-debates","362"

The guilt is on the woman who commits that sin, and the country that does the procedure. What you must understand is that we as a people are being held jointly accountable for this mass genocide of the unborn. Sorry, I just buy into the it's easier to kill them before we even know that we can't raise them. Your attitude is defeatist and alarmist as we just don't have starving children in my country with bloated stomachs, nor do they die of common diseases in the alleys as homeless vagabonds. What do you mean by extreme? Extreme health concerns? I answered that they are exempt from the one abortion rule. Extreme poverty? We have the job corp with child care where women learn trades now. We have HUD for government subsidized housing in housing that is so nice, the neighbors don't even know they are government subsidized. So, write back and give me you extreme circumstances and I'll be more specific. If it's cuz their extremely horny and irresponsible and they keep getting pregnant, the one per woman policy stands, because that's why it exists in the first place. To force them to consider the consequences.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:17 PM","abortion-debates","364"

But if you covered that then my sincere apologies. From a religious perspective you are correct i believe, but for those willing to do such a thing I'd wager they are not religious. But religion aside, i was just making one point regarding the legalities of dodging your proposed laws. I'm sorry but thats not what i meant, that doesn't even pertain to social services in a first world country. I'm talking about the massive increase in cases of abuse, neglect ... I'm not saying they shouldn't be born, I'm just saying the case loads are going to get bigger. That makes me cringe.

My goal wouldn't be to be heavy handed, but for these decisions to made with full knowledge and eyes wide open. I don't believe that happens today. And the issues you raise show that much would need to be considered to fine tune a complete and fair policy. Agreed, but once they fly to another country on vacation, they are responsible for their own actions before God, and the US will not intervene if they have medical problems in the country they go to. I only responded to your border crossing scenario because that is controllable if they plan on taking a day trip for an abortion by driving over the border. A simple 3.00 urine sourced pregnancy test going and coming would deal with that abuse of the law. I consider that argument to be a red herring. By that I mean, that if we researched the levels of juvenile delinquency in the US now, or any other childhood malady; and I don't know those numbers. But just for the sake of argument, let's say it's at 0.5% per hundred thousand; then add that 1.3 million lives saved and apply the same percentages to them in every category you consider based on real world stats. Most all of the women who are getting these abortions are working, productive, intelligent vital members of society with families and support systems available to them, and even if they're poor or teens. They will love their children and be nurturing mothers in most all cases. For the ones who need assistance, this Country has those services available at every level of need. From medical and psychiatry for the child, to counseling, housing and job training for mom so she can offer a secure home environment. Thanks, I think it's rational while disciplined, and though it has teeth, it isn't intended to entrap or punish, but to encourage responsible behavior and a conscientious respect for themselves and their actions, not to mention their unborn children who might end up being a genius or child prodigy. MY ARGUMENT IS THIS: THE UNBORN CHILD WE KILL WILL FOREVER REMAIN A QUESTION MARK OF UNREALIZED POTENTIAL. THE CHILD THAT LIVES HAS THE PROMISE AND HOPE OF GREATNESS. AND TO DENY ONES OWN OFFSPRING THAT OPPORTUNITY IS THE GREATEST PUNISHMENT A WOMAN CAN INFLICT UPON HERSELF, AND IS WHY SO MANY ARE HAUNTED FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES AFTER SUFFERING THROUGH AN ABORTION WHICH IS MOST ASSUREDLY A FORM OF SELF MUTILATION AS MUCH AS IT IS INFANTICIDE.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:56 PM","abortion-debates","367"

"11-19-2008","11293",25,"simone","333148","Common law? The common law of which nation? And, who enforces this common law? Men on the verge of engaging in sexual congress with a woman, willing or not, fertile or not, have little thought of entering into an implied-in-fact contract. I would very much like to know from whence this implied-in-fact contract has been derived. I very much fear that it exploded suddenly from the untninking nether regions of certain people. Truly! What short of lala world creates these most unreal scenarios? Men in western culture which derives its beliefs and social mores from patriarchal religions, these men are not taught very much responsibility. Responsibility seems to be the sole obligation of women in these cultures. Women are responsible for all sin, for all evil, they must suffer for the sins of all others, a most unfair and misogynistic situation.","Joel_Henderson","333511","The one with the pregnancy in question The judicial branch. Ignorance of he law is NEVER an excuse. Well if they're going to think with that, then they can make CONTRACTS with that too. One in which free people are responsibile for their actions; the alternative is laws against private meetings between unmarried persons, like in Islamic countries. Then they can learn the hard way-- legal consequences. Well they didn't fulfill it very well if they're pregnant. We're assuming that nobody forced her.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:13 PM","abortion-debates","369"

And be subject to arrest and prosecution when she gets back. Their parents will have 9 months to accept them-- or to find somone who will. It's no reason to kill a child-- NOTHING is. Abortion was always legal for medical emergencies-- but ONLY for such, and Roe v. Wade court forgot about everything BUT emergencies, reading the law selectively by will and ignorance.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:28 PM","abortion-debates","370"
"11-20-2008","11293",25,"hollyh","333516","Clearly you didn't read my post or Archangels. It is agreed that any woman with dual citizenship/passport who returns to that country for an abortion will be protected by the laws of that land. She will not be subject to 'arrest and prosecution' apon return to the US.","chester","333522","Holly, I read with interest your comment that you are what is called ""Pro-Life"" and what some of us call profetallife. I can understand how you could make that choice for yourself, but I have difficulty understanding how you would want the law to make that choice for other women. Be that as it may, your comment in frustration that I highlighted above I believe indicates the blind zeal of the profetallifers who post here. They remain willfully ignorant of any POV than their own, and they further willfully misinterpret others' writings in order not to have to think clearly about what others say here. They simply do not get, in this case, that no one, NO ONE can be prosecuted in the United States for an act they did outside its jurisdiction. It's insane to think that, if one committed an act in, say, the Netherlands, that was legal there but illegal in the USA, that they would be subject to arrest and trial here for the act they committed there . That would simply turn the Constitution and the laws on their heads.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:39 AM","abortion-debates","372"
