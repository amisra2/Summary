What sanction should the law demand for those who either have an abortion or perform one?","Archangel","319495","That's a whole other question and debate. The issue here is, if it is true that the question exists that they feel pain, and dream while in the womb, then shouldn't they be given the benefit of the doubt and we ere on the side of caution regarding how late in the pregnancy abortions are allowed to be performed?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:21 AM","abortion-debates","76"

"08-07-2008","11293",6,"Archangel","318124","If we can just get murderers like you to stop killing them inutero, and allow them to grow to full term which is the chance any person deserves, then they can and will survive outside the womb just fine. Your logic is as inconsistent as it is irrational. Is a tomato that is too young to pick yet, not a tomato yet? Is a goat that is too young to give milk, not a goat yet? Of coarse not on both counts. Then why do you people insist that a child which is not yet ready to be born is not yet human or deserving of human rights yet? Especially since it's undeniable on all counts that you yourself were once in their exact position and have personally seen what a fetus can become if only allowed to grow.","Neanderthal79","319527","What you're talking about is potential. The fetus has the potential to become a person. So does every sperm. So, what you are saying is every sperm can be a potential person. Is masturbation murder? Am I killing babies everytime my girlfriend goes to work? Or, you are going to say life begins at fertilization, right? After fertilization it's still six or seven days before the egg reaches the uterus, and not every egg makes it. 80% of a woman's fertilized eggs are rinsed out of her body once a month during her period. So, what you are saying is that any woman who's had more than one period is a serial killer. Talk about inconsistency .","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:15 PM","abortion-debates","81"

There is no other meaning that can logically be gleaned from it. BTW, what if the opposite hypothesis is proved true to a medical certainty, i.e., that the fetus does NOT feel pain or dream in utero, would you then favor the elimination of all restrictions on abortion?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:33 PM","abortion-debates","86"

This is about human life, and the deaths of unborn children who are healthy vital fetuses.","chester","319704","Sorry, but it IS a gender issue. The issue is who gets to make the choice of whether or not to continue a pregnancy, the pregnant woman or the government in the person of some nameless, faceless bureaucrat. I think it would be instructive to see just exactly why you favor the bureaucrat. It would also be instructive to see just exactly what punishment you would have society impose on a woman who chose to terminate her pregnancy and on the physician who performed the termination.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:33 PM","abortion-debates","90"
