It's comfortable, I suppose, for you folks to bloviate in generalities about such things, but you and your ilk become remarkably vague when it comes to actual boots on the ground, rubber meeting the road practicalities.","hollyh","334115","I dont know, hence why i was asking for opinions. I thought Archangels idea had merit and thought, my mistake, that people on both sides could offer ideas. I was actually interested in your genuine response. Instead of a simple ""i disagree heres why ..."" you sprout sarcasm touting scarlet bradishing. I'm amazed at how quickly you've changed your tone with me simply because i identified with one opinion from the other side. Me and my ilk??? im pro choice, which would make you my ""ilk"".","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:51 PM","abortion-debates","451"

Bill creating a buffer zone around abortion clinics. You can read about it here. firstamendmentcenter.org: Assembly - Topic The question I have is why doesn't this bill also protect religious organizations from militant gays who encroach on churches and block entry to them, or worse yet, enter them and disrupt the service as a group did in California recently? Also, why doesn't it apply to Peta who also throws red paint which represents blood on women wearing furs? Again, we see inconsistency in the laws which limit one group while giving others a pass using the same tactics. To protect women and abortion-clinic doctors and staff, Congress in 1994 passed a law called F.A.C.E. the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (18 U.S.C., Sect. 248). The law prohibits injuring, intimidating or interfering with any person who obtains or provides reproductive health services. It provides for civil and criminal penalties against violators. The law has survived several First Amendment challenges. Sometimes courts will pass a special injunction providing for even greater control over anti-abortion demonstrators. Many times these injunctions take the form of buffer zones.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:30 PM","abortion-debates","457"

"11-28-2008","11293",31,"hollyh","334574","JH, your probably twice my age yet reply with the maturity of someone half my age. Truth you say ... well the truth is your spitfire hatred opinion means zip! And mine? well, it seems the government and the judicial system agrees. The Supreme Court in the matter of Roe V Wade set the precedent for legal abortion in the USA. Its no wonder your so full of hatred, imagine having an opinion that the Supreme Court disagreed with. And as you quoted ""their word is FINAL!"".","Joel_Henderson","334626","No, that would be someone with less than first-grade literacy; since the use of ""your"" as a contraction of ""you are,"" displays that you haven't graduated SECOND grade. Another logical fallacy: appeal to popularity, since you can't argue the law. You just follow the law right along like a good little sheep-- even into a gas-chamber. Well, when they came for the Jews, some wouldn't speak up because they weren't a Jew... and it's no different when the law is twisted to murder any OTHER unpopular faction. And Hitler's Final Solution set a precedent for ethnic cleansing in Germany too-- your point? Not approvingly; actually every state is sovereign by law, but the federal government illegally USURPED authority over the states during the antebellum era. That's why we had the World Wars, socialism, the Great Depression, the New Deal the Cold War,-- and now the War on Terror. Socialism was disproven as a political sophistry in ancient Greece c. over 2400 years ago, but came about in the 20th century due to American globalism resulting from this bellum-era usurpation and consequent destabilization; elective abortion was also prohibited about 400 B.C. under Hippocrates, but this is simply a co-morbid barbarism.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:37 PM","abortion-debates","464"

Should Jews have refused to shoot Nazis? However the issue here is basic sovereignty in the USA. Fools even believe that the Civil War somehow ""proved"" that the federal government has national power under the law-- i.e. that a military outcome somehow changed the facts of HISTORY! There's no arguing with fools like that; if we live in a dictatorship, let's ADMIT it-- and the truth shall set you free.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:42 PM","abortion-debates","465"
