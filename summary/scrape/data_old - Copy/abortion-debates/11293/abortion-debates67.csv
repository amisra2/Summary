How many times do I need to say that my only opinion on the topic is that the choice of whether or not to continue a pregnancy is the sole province of the woman involved and that I will support whatever choice she makes? How many times do I have to say that this is an area where the law must needs be silent? Is that really so hard for the restrictionists here to understand? the choice of whether or not to continue a pregnancy is the sole province of the woman involved and that I will support whatever choice she makes","Winston Smith","340510","you have no opinion on the topic? of course you do : by the way why is a man not entitled to have an opinion on abortion ? is it illegal in the USA, or is just a rule you made up, or is just an opinion? The judges who voted for the Roe v. Wade decision: Harry Blackmun, William J. Brennan, Chief Justice Warren Burger, William O. Douglas, Thurgood Marshall, Lewis Powell and Potter Stewart were all men. so according to you they ought to have disqualified themselves due to their gender (Chester's law: men are not entitled to an opinion on abortion) for a man without opinion you certainly hold a few","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:37 PM","abortion-debates","991"

Your equation of Pro-choice with Pro-abortion is simply WRONG! We oppose the concept of forced abortion just as strenuously as we do the concept of forced non-abortion.

If women do not have the right to choose between pregnancy or abortion, in present day they would be forced to be pregnant. The possibility, however, exists that if women do not own and control their own bodies, in future times they could be forced to have abortions as women were in Roman Catholic and Nazi Bavaria.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:51 PM","abortion-debates","994"

I support the right of a woman to abort her fetus OR NOT , as she chooses. I also support the right of a woman (or man for that matter) to excise a tumor OR NOT , as (s)he chooses. The acts are: 1. Moral equivalents and 2. None of your, my, or the law's business. If that rises to the level of pushing your ICK! button, so be it. Your misbegotten idea that the law has the right to intervene in this most intimate, private of decisions that a woman could possible make certainly pushes mine. I have three daughters of child-bearing age and two granddaughters who will soon be. Impose your disgusting ideas on them at your peril. They are strong, intelligent women who are perfectly capable of making this choice without input from the likes of the profetallifers who post here, thank you very much.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:52 AM","abortion-debates","1001"

You have made it obvious that you favor restrictions on a woman's freedom to choose; that you would empower the nanny state to intrude where it has no business going. OK, a few questions: 1. What will your restrictions look like? How will they be decided upon? 2. What sanctions will exist for those who violate them? 3. Upon whom will the sanctions be applied? 4. Assuming that you would impose some sort of legal sanctions, how will you avoid the issue of Jury Nullification? Maybe you will do better than another poster here who had to admit that he/she/it had not considered these issue, nor was he/she/it required to - that all that was needed was an opinion. Sorry, but that's not good enough. Either you have a plan for implementation in place, or it becomes simply one more example of pontification and bloviation.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:13 AM","abortion-debates","1003"

Sorry if i have confused you.","Another opinion","340795","I understand your point of view of not thinking that all ones opinions should be made law. There are many opinions I also hold that I also would not make law since it is quite clear that there can be a wide range of opinions and approaches to a wide array of subjects, where one cannot say that one approach is the right one. However, in a Democracy, we the people need to set some directions in what we expect from our government in terms of laws and we cannot shirk those responsibilities completely. There are some issues that one eventually does need to make a stand on. Murder of born people, for example, is an issue that most would agree should be controlled by law. Then, I would think that most would consider that the question ""Would you stand to make this opinion against murder of born people universal law?"" should be answered YES! Sometimes, the answer to that question needs to be yes if we are to have any laws at all. How does one decide, then, which opinions to apply as universal laws (in our voting habits, responses to polls, or any other civic activity)? That can be a tough question but it seems that most of the rhethoric I hear concerning laws are questions of balancing rights and responsibilities. There is no one answer to how one strikes these balances but to fail to present an opinion about law is just to abdicate responsibility purely to a party one votes for that one blindly trusts to get it right. I don't know about you, but I think that there are very few politicians that fully think these ethical issues through. The age of the politician / philosopher is over and many, if not most, politicians can have as knee-jerk reactions as many in the public have. That is why debate is so important in a society. I, for one, do not blindly trust my politicians on ethical issues. Unfortunately, there seems to be a lack of genuine open-minded debate on these issues in the grander public sphere (ex. no televised debates about abortion rights between experts who know both sides of the issue fully, where they actually listen to each other). Therefore, the only place seemingly left for actual discussion on these topics is forums such as this. I feel that it is part of our civic duty as citizens of a Democracy to engage in such debates and act on their conclusions in the form of our voting habits, responses to polls, letters to our representatives, or any other form of civic activity that gets us actually INVOLVED in our democracy instead of being complacent and apathetic about it. So, my bottom line is that, if you hold your view strongly enough, have a strong foundation of rational support behind it, and it doesn't interfere with major rights granted us in the Constitution, then you have every right to think that your view should become law and play your part in supporting that view through your voting habits, civic activity and expressions in forums such as this. Nobody has the rational right to tell you otherwise. After all, in a Democracy, if the people (and you as part of ""the people"") do not have a right to shape the direction of the laws that are imposed on them (through the choices they make in their voting habits, etc.), then who does? Should we shirk all such responsibilities to the political elites?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:37 AM","abortion-debates","1005"
