When you are a woman - anything you want or need is apparently a convenience - whether it be an education, a job, a secure financial future, the ability to support oneself or others, feeling safe, having a goal or a dream. The greatest gift we seem to offer is our uterus and anything that takes precedece over it is a convenience matter. I am but an organ.

"12-21-2008","11293",52,"hollyh","337491","And yet for a fetus their is no death certificate issued, no funeral, no buriel ... or any other ritual performed from the passing of human beings. There is no point debating with you if you continue along your intellectually bankrupt lines. Firstly i asked you to provide proof/evidence of your claims against planned parenthood. You claim they lie and force women into having abortions. Secondly, and once again, i do ask that you read the entire thread before making snatched references to it. Archangel also said this meeting with planned parenthood took place decades ago when he was quiet young. It is not a representation of the present.","nononsense","337526"," You just know everything about everyone, don't you? LOL. Couples and families often have very personal ways of dealing with the death of an unborn child no matter how or when it died. As a calligrapher, I have had couples ask me to make them a memorial certificate for their unborn child who died. Part of the problem with grieving openly is the ridicule they receive from ignorant hard-hearted individals. With the wide use of ultra sound, the child is readily seen and its sex is determined. The child is often named as a result of knowing the sex and seeing it. Therefore, it is expected that parents would grieve at the loss of the child. Furthermore, the abortion clinics do NOT let the mother see her dead child. They sometimes do and it is very traumatic for them. Planned Parenthood also does not allow the press to get out that women have died as a result of an abortion at their clinic. You cannot hear. You do not listen. You do not care. Carolina Review: January 2006 While I was with the doctor, I asked her what she would tell a pregnant UNC student who did not know what options were available to her. Immediately the doctor handed me a Planned Parenthood pamphlet and told me that they offer a variety of servicessurgical abortion, chemical abortion, and birth control. ""The counseling Planned Parenthood offers students, on the other hand, is completely inadequate. When talking to students who are trying to decide whether or not to keep their baby, they discuss the following: a person is ready for parenthood, they say, when they are ready to make a child feel loved and wanted (implying that the child has no inherent worth of its ownit is all based on the mothers feelings at the moment), and when they have the support of family and friends (implying that if your friends do not want you to have a baby, then you should simply kill it)."" ""This is no counseling for a college student, and will automatically make the parenting option seem completely unfeasible. Students need real counsel. I was shocked at the sheer lack of any choice in the options the doctor laid out."" Carolina Review, NCU-Chapel Hill, An Investigation of Abortion Practices at the University, January 2006 Fact: Above is only one article written about the manipulative so-called counseling pregnant women receive when they enter a Planned Parenthood. With only one mention of adoption, saying you will have to go thru such and such to give your baby up... they pretend they have ""given all the options."" But their goal is to promote abortion for crisis pregnancies. And they overwhelmingly meet their goal. Only 1-2% of cases are referred to adoption agencies.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:05 AM","abortion-debates","771"

Care to explain ? Since there is no discontinuity from the moment of conception to adulthood, it is irrelevant when do you terminate a human life. As I said before all I care is that no suffering takes place. Can an embryo or fetus feel pain?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:09 AM","abortion-debates","773"
"12-21-2008","11293",52,"antonia","337508","Everything is a natural process. Women have abortions, so it is not against their nature. Women are not only parents. There are also a number of moral issues you are ignoring related to the rights of the woman, and responsibilities and consequences to real children. Like who is taking care of the newborn I just dropped, during coffee break, before heading back out to the fields.","Winston Smith","337532","False, abortion is human intervention which is not a natural process. Oh! I thought it was against their nature and that only chose abortion because they had been raped or the child was unwanted or poor things there was no one around to care of the child when born. Now you are talking. I agree on that Let's concentrate on the matter at hand","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:16 AM","abortion-debates","774"

I think the USA has a low not to inflict pain to those condemned to death when the sentence is carried out, which of course I support) so I ask the same for an innocent life. Is it too much to ask from the pro-abortion camp. Of course only if it is convenient to the 'mother'?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:28 AM","abortion-debates","778"

God cursed women with the pain of childbirth for deceiving Adam. And Mary is supposed to bear her cross.","Winston Smith","337538","If I supported the views which you insist on imposing on me, for it would serve you as ammunition in this debate (metaphorically speaking) I wouldnt have supported my wife in everything she wanted to achieve and also my daughter. God did not curse Eves daughters for deceiving Adam but for having the ambition of becoming like God (although not God). She saw that the tree was good to eat and pleasing to the eye, and that it was enticing for the wisdom that it could give. So she took some of its fruit and ate it. She also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate it. Then the eyes of both of them were opened and they realised that they were naked. So they sewed fig leaves together to make themselves loincloths. Being a woman she was superficial and only cared about the surface of things: the fruit tasted good and most importantly : it was pleasing to the eye. Adam being a twit went along with it, as most men do, for they are conditioned since childhood by their mothers to obey women and say : Yes, dear. Well, it is not mens fault that women dont lay eggs, or is that painful also?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:53 AM","abortion-debates","780"
