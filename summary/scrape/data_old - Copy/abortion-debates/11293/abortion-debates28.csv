Try a mental exercise, you are the only person who's blood type matches the president and unless you give him your kidney he'll die. Imagine someone forcing you to have the surgery and give up your body part, regardless of your feelings on the matter. That's about as close as a man could get to knowing what it would be like to have a forced pregnancy. Imagine a woman whose trained all her life for some career or another but had to give up her chance (let's say she's an astronaut) because her birth control failed. If men can tell women what they can and can't do with their body, our society can never be fully just. Having an abortion must surely be the hardest decision a woman could ever make and I'm sure many regret it forever. But to force a woman to breed like a barnyard animal is surely worse.","Darn Republican","333839","I think as a mental excersize you should consider this... Americans, your fellow citizens thinking before they act so the government that thought they knew so much saw how wrong they were by over reaching. Imagine knowing that whatever trouble you could get into... you were entirely responsible for because there was nooooooooooo... escape net from the government, so you simply behaved better... then collectively the nations was better off. Imagine that huh? I see what you are saying, but I hear more talking points than I hear civic responsibility in this last one from you. I agree abortion is the most gripping choice a woman may have to deal with, but again would not have had to get there without her thinking of the consequences before she gets into a situation that may have long lasting implications both personally and socially.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:08 PM","abortion-debates","406"

I don't think the govt. should fix people's mistakes for them OR hinder them in fixing their own. The best thing govt. can do is STAY OUT OF THE WAY. It holds true in business and it holds true with medical care.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:31 PM","abortion-debates","407"

Most nations practice post-natal abortion by delivering viably, and then allowing the preemie to die on the table by refusing adequate care, since preemies are very expensive drains on their health-care budgets; so they just look the other way while their lives are snuffed out. Same with abortion, partial-birth or otherwise-- it's sheer convenience and cost-related. FOLLOW THE MONEY.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:43 PM","abortion-debates","411"

Go on, back up your assertion. I was very sternly dressed down once by Phyllis for being willing to compromise on aborting deformed/seriously damaged fetuses which I believed have no hope of a quality life. And Chloe is a more staunch classical pro-lifer than I am regarding certain reasons for abortion. But what really matters here is that I have never claimed to be the most ardent anything on this forum, and that includes my christianity. I may be the most outspoken conservative in many difficult issues, but I have never held myself up as the most ardent supporter of any school of thought. from your post #390 on this forum. OK, I concede. You are correct, and I erred. You are really namby pamby, wishy washy on the subject of abortion. Now are you satisfied?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:37 PM","abortion-debates","413"

If either or both had a billion dollars, there'd be no abortion. Therfore her abortion is soley to save (or make) her a LOT of money in comparison-- in addition to helping her try to find a richer guy (i.e. MORE money). Likewise, abortion makes women ""equal"" by letting them thus EARN as much money as men, by not being tied down via unwanted pregnancies and kids, and related expenses; in addition they can earn MORE by hooking a rich guy (since 90% of women will ONLY marry men who earn more than they do) rather than being a dirt-poor single mom. When women ""strike the jackpot"" financially with a rich husband, they chiefly just want to settled down and have kids. IT'S THE MONEY! Meanwhile, socialist countries want to save money by skimping on scant resources, so they simply ""re-define"" when life begins, ""Playing God"" as a matter of convenience in order to avoid spending vast sums on saving nascent children-- since those who would have been aborted, end up costing the most in various public services, and hence are voted as unfit to live, with every problem-pregnancy being aborted-- whether for financial reasons or medical. Pre-natal sugery isn't exactly high on their priorities-list As for social security, we are simply seeing the inevitable statism come home to roost: FACTIONALISM AGAINST FUTURE GENERATIONS. People simply borrow against the credit of those not yet born, and forcing later generations to pick up the tab. Again, this is simply the inevitable result of all-powerful democratic government: i.e.there's a general attrition of the majoirty-interest-- and erosion of the rights of the minority. However the fools think that the all-powerful ""national"" government would NEVER violate the Constitution. Jefferson said clearly, that ""any debt without a tax to pay it in the same term, is a theft against future voters."" But that bothers no one now.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:46 PM","abortion-debates","416"

And you are so shallow that this perspective seems perfectly rational to you. Talk about sheer disgusting cynicism! Oh Lord, how terrible Ali is! He actually considers a spiritually based moral perspective in deciding how he lives his life and whether or not it's right to kill perfectly innocent unborn children to the tune of 1.3 MILLION per year in America. And please; PLEASE!!! For once in your life answer a question hypocrite; what is disgustingly cynical about my attitude?
