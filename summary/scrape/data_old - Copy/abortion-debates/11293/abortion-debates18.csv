"08-25-2008","11293",18,"Another opinion","321368","Perhaps you have an idealized version of Communism but, nevertheless, it is worth discussing it. In your idea of communism, how would you address the two concerns I brought up. Namely, what incentives would exist for people to work harder on their jobs than their friends and neighbors? Also, what specific internal corruption control mechanisms does your version of communism support? Again, it depends on ones socio-economic standing. Most people probably are happier under such a system. However, it is not as beneficial to people who are more ambitious or who have an entreprenerial spirit - there is just more beaurocracy and difficulties for people who wish to push themselves to exceed far above their peers. So, the system has a tendency to have a flattening effect when it comes to socio-economic differences, which is fine for most people who wouldn't rise above the crowd anyway, but does have its disadvantages, as were outline by the Swedish engineer who I knew who immigrated here to the US.","chester","321370","I think that both questions can be answered in the same manner. The competitiveness that accompanies the red-in-tooth-and-claw form of capitalism that is practiced in the US today is not innate; it is learned behavior. Just as competition is learned, so cooperation can be learned. Will it be easy? - NO! Can it be done? - YES! Should it be done? - UNEQUIVOCALLY YES! When should it be done? - YESTERDAY!!","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:26 PM","abortion-debates","256"

It needs to be defined by what it stands for and by the details in how it hopes to acheive that. Where communism is concerned, I am certainly aware that it gained supporters due to the justifiable criticism it had about unrestrained capitalism. However, it largely failed because its system for alleviating those concerns was seriously flawed and also because capitalism itself changed to be more constrained (8 hour work day, better working conditions, etc.). Again, if you wish to defend communism, you need to defend it for what it is capable of acheiving not for what it is against.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:18 PM","abortion-debates","258"

Capitalism did not bring about these changes on its own. Had the ownership class of the past, or of today for that matter, had its way, none of this would have occurred. The only thing lacking is social ownership of the means of production.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:32 PM","abortion-debates","259"

As I have understood it from my limited reading of history, it was fear of a full change to socialism that made the elites give in to the most critical changes needed to make capitalism palatable to the masses of poor workers - where many of these changes were socialist ideas. Indeed, there was a similar trend in the 19th century when it was the fear of uprisings such as had happened in the French revolution and later smaller upheavals throughout Europe that convinced the elites that they had to give in to at least some of the democratic aspirations or risk losing all their power - Bismark was particularly adept at such transformations. Either way, that history is now past. What we face today is restrained capitalism vs other alternatives. You fail to state any clear advantage between communism and the current version of capitalism, with all of its restraints benefiting employees (8 hour work day, employer subsidized health care, etc.). Again, communism showed itself to be a failed system in comparison to this current version of capitalism. If you wish to present a better version of communism than the one that failed, then you need to address those points which made the first version fail. Specifically, you need to address the two points I brought up: 1) What incentives would exist for people to work harder on their jobs than their friends and neighbors? 2) What specific internal corruption control mechanisms does your version of communism support?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:09 PM","abortion-debates","260"
"08-25-2008","11293",18,"None","None","None","Archangel","321398","I'll tell you what precipitated the acceptance of the NEW DEAL and the social programs that came with it. It was the Great Depression and the cold hard realization that America had no economic safety net built into its social system. The BREAD LINES single handedly caused the creation of the welfare system. It wasn't a class war between the haves and the have nots because even millionaires lost their life savings with the collapse of the banks and ended up on bread lines. The FDIC was created at that time so people money was insured in Banks. You see, my socialist friends, it took that Government program to get Americans to trust banks enough to place their money in them once again. You can imagine the paranoia that existed when it came to trusting banks again after that depression. So don't credit socialism with the New Deal, credit necessity and a social conscience with it.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:09 PM","abortion-debates","261"

The New Deal was simply embodying what was coming up from the people. Remember also that every single New Deal reform was and still is bitterly opposed by the ownership class. The New Deal and FDR saved the capitalist system in spite of itself.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:16 PM","abortion-debates","262"

Incentive is what drives human beings to do things, and without it we do nothing. Most communist countries have failed. I am more in favor of restrained capitalism.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:29 PM","abortion-debates","263"

It fools the masses into believing in a fiction, ie. a benovelent despot, while the priest class, ie. the party/government officers, live high on the hog. The various communist countries that have ever existed were led by tyrants dresses up in populist robes. It's all ####, it doesn't work and never will. More Government = more corruption and communism is the ultimate Big Government. It (attempts to) suppress a person's natural inclination and is doomed to fail.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:44 PM","abortion-debates","264"

The instinct to keep what you kill (so to speak). The instinct for individualism. And as for ""Stalin-ism"", everywhere 'communism' has been implemented, the results were the same. Look at Cuba for an example. People won't tow the communist line without a brutal tyrant cracking a whip and that's why the 'workers utopia' has never evolved!","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:15 PM","abortion-debates","266"

You're right, people that don't use protection/pills are stupid. However, are stupid people really the ones you want as parents? Do you really want that many kids flooding the adoption system, in which many will remain orphans for a very long time?

I wonder if pro-choicers have really thought this through before they make it. (I actually hope they haven't!) See, on one hand you believe that the concept of life--viable human life--doesn't really apply at the embryonic stage. Or if you do, then it's not applicable enough to consider such abortion murder. But by arguing for abortion based on some of the BABIES in the world, in orphanages, then you're using an example of VIABLE human life to argue against the pro-life position. Of all the arguments I hear on behalf of the pro-choice position, this one has to be the worst of all. Abort 'em early because we don't want too many babies clogging up the system ... that's basically what you're saying. No longer does your argument have anything to do with a woman's right to choose--it's all about the system which is a much broader issue with a host of other problems and possible solutions. You've abandoned your best focus of argumentation--that women should be able to keep or not keep their pregnancy. Using one social problem to fix another isn't the answer to crowded orphanages. Even many on the left feel that abortion should be rare and be reduced.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:18 PM","abortion-debates","270"
