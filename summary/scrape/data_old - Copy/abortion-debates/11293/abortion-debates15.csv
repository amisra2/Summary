"08-21-2008","11293",15,"Galactababe","320996","Wrong again, Kemosabe. Because you see, the woman who finds herself pregnant and CHOOSES to carry the baby to term, is making the far more difficult and honorable choice. The woman who CHOOSES to put her baby up for adoption to give it a better life than she can provide, is making the ultimate, unselfish, choice. The woman who CHOOSES abortion is the one choosing the selfish, easy way out.","Shooterandproud","321000","In your opinion, and not in all situations. In some situations. In other situations its the dumb choice. In your opinion, because you don't know what its like. You've never been faced with an unwanted pregnancy, and you cannot possibly know every American woman's circumstances when it comes to an unwanted pregnancy, therefore you are in no position to choose for her. And you did not refute my argument at all.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:03 PM","abortion-debates","212"
"08-21-2008","11293",15,"Galactababe","321001","Shooterandproud: Sorry, this is a ridiculous analogy. We are talking about THIS country, THIS country's laws, and THIS country is not engaged in battle on our home turf. How about if you were in the basement with us and wouldn't stop bawling your head off and risked exposing us? Would it be okay if I took a rock to your head?","Shooterandproud","321004","Again, scientific improbabilities. This is a metaphor, not everything must be completely perfect. What if you were traveling? I don't have to explain all of this to you. It would be more beneficial to this debate if you would just answer the question instead of beating around the bush.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:10 PM","abortion-debates","214"
"08-21-2008","11293",15,"Galactababe","321005","Shooterandproud: Oh, but I did. This was your argument: Whether you agree or disagree that the choices a pregnant woman who delivers a baby makes are more honorable and less selfish, is irrelevant. You have acknowledged that they are indeed, choices. Therefore, they are not against choice. They CHOOSE to have sex, they CHOOSE to go through with the pregnancy and they CHOOSE to give the baby up for adoption. They CHOOSE life.","Shooterandproud","321008","You are anti choice because you are against the choice of the woman to abort or not. And saying that by having sex you are giving permission to let a baby live in your stomach is like saying it is a cyclists fault for being hit by a car, because he chose to step outside and ride his bike. Therefore he deserves no medical attention.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:32 PM","abortion-debates","217"
"08-21-2008","11293",15,"Galactababe","321015","Punished? This is why I call you immature, because you think like a child. Preventive measures sometimes fail. She can give the child up for adoption to parents who would give their right arm to adopt. Then she won't have to suffer the ""punishment"" of having to raise her own child.","Shooterandproud","321028","When your argument fails, belittle your opponent. Aren't insults against the rules or something? Adoption is not as easy as you think. AO explained that. Spending your life savings and hard time to raise something you don't want, sounds bad. Saying that the irresponsible deserves this makes you sound like you want to punish the irresponsible like this.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:26 PM","abortion-debates","221"
"08-21-2008","11293",15,"Galactababe","321019","Shooterandproud: Tell your health teacher he's fired. The baby grows in the mother's uterus, not her stomach The uterus serves no other purpose in a woman's body than to serve her reproductive cycle. By introducing sperm to the egg that drops into a woman's fallopian tube, the resulting fertilization causes the fertilized embryo to attach itself to the woman's uterus to grow. Don't introduce sperm in there and an egg can't be fertilized....duh! Btw, pre-natal care is very important for both the baby and the mother, therefore the only reason not to get medical care is ignorance. There are plenty of clinics and Medicaid for those too poor to have their own health insurance. And for all of those spandex bike riders who think they own the gosh darn road riding 3 abreast and not following the rules of the road, they DO deserve to get hit by a car. But hey, I'd call an ambulance for them anyway.","Shooterandproud","321030","She. That was a play on words, because when we were all little we thought the baby was in mommy's stomach. You have about a 25-35% chance of getting pregnant with unprotected sex. And cyclists are 11 times more likely to be killed on the road than a person in a car. http://www.daclarke.org/AltTrans/BikesDangerous.html Stay home instead of biking, and your chances of dying are dramatically decreased. ""Care"" being an abortion, because it solves the problem, just like if a biker is hit it'll solve the problem because he probably won't die if he gets care. Considering they're doing a service to you and this country by not emitting so much damn pollution you should be thanking them. I bike everywhere for three reasons: the environment, my health, and laziness so I won't have to get a driver's license.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:50 PM","abortion-debates","222"

Your story about the free speech referendum at your school reminded me of when Ahmadinejad spoke at Columbia, that's all. Plus my daughter's boyfriend goes there. Plus, it's always interesting to know whether I am debating with an American citizen about American law or someone with an ""international"" perspective. I was not familiar with what GB's policy is regarding abortions. I see it is legal. I came across the following: http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth...ion/DH_4063857 Some interesting facts: 90% of abortions were carried out at under 13 weeks gestation: 70% were at under 10 weeks. The 2007 data shows increases in abortions for those aged under 18. medical abortions accounted for 35% of the total compared with 30% in 2006 the abortion rate was highest at 36 per 1,000, for women age 19","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:07 PM","abortion-debates","225"
