"01-07-2009","11293",63,"Another opinion","339298","Lets apply those same question to the rest of reality. You think that all women are responsible in their decisions about abortion. So, you deny that women are capable of being irresponsible. Otherwise, you might think that there are no negative consequences to any decision a woman makes about abortion so it is not possible for her to act irresponsibly since all decisions have only positive consequences. There, I would disagree on two points. First, she might be irresponsible to her own safety since late term abortions are more medically dangerous than early term. Secondly, I know you deny this, but there is a sentient human that can now feel, suffer, experience pain and emotions that most Americans feel the need to protect but that you apparently don't. Killing such a late term fetus thus does carry negative consequences that need to be balanced with good reasons. Who decides on the reasons acceptable for late term abortions? The same people that usually decide in the case of laws restricting human behavior (as I have said in many posts already) - legislatures outline general rules while judges decide on specific cases. That is how it works for all other laws, why not for laws limiting abortion? That is your opinion, not absolute truth. The same could be said for any other curtailing of freedom. Again, applying your reasoning to the rest of reality, then you would not curtail any freedoms and say that it is not a justice's business to interfere in any human behavior. Why should abortion be treated any differently than other rights and freedoms? They all have their limits. Just because your answer is simple does not mean that it is thought out. You have avoided over and over any discussion about the rights and/or value of the fetus out of an illogical claim that you have no right to even consider any aspects of the fetus - sentience, etc. You claim a right as absolute and then avoid discussing any of the competing claims. The fact that you avoid addressing the competing issues makes it very clear that you have not thought out your arguement but blindly stick to just repeating unsupported claims.","chester","339349","Now you have to explain how you get from A to B in your last sentence. Once again, you fail to provide any definition whatsoever of the word ""irresponsibly"". What does the word mean to you? What standards will you use? Who should make this determination? As to your two points later on, those are matters for HER and her alone to decide. If she believes the negative consequences outweigh the positive ones, she has the choice to refrain from terminating her pregnancy. If she believes the fetus feels pain, then she should act accordingly. In both cases, she has the right to make that determination without the coercive force of the law. Softball question. Because, with our privacy fast disappearing, this remains perhaps the most intimate of choices, and it must be so in order to preserve whatever shred of privacy remains to an individual. Once again a false dichotomy. Lincoln gave the correct response to a heckler who posed one of these to him. He said, ""Why do you suppose that, because I do not want a black woman as my slave that I would want her for my wife?"" You STILL don't get it, do you? IT'S NOT MY CALL!!! If a woman cares to give credence to the ""competing issues"", I will give her my full support. If another woman chooses otherwise, I will give that woman my full support also. In either case, it's HER call to make, not mine, not yours, not society's, and most assuredly not the law's.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:06 PM","abortion-debates","931"

With that in mind, this is simply a diversion tactic for debating. So that is your answer to why Chester is asking for details when this is an illogical part of the current question you pose.","Another opinion","339351","I wanted to add another point about debates with Chester. Namely, I fully realize that nothing I say will convince Chester since he is one of those posters that claims truth without being willing to defend it by responding to opposing claims. He is too closed minded to hold a true debate. So, you might ask, why do I continue debating him? The main reason is that I have noticed that the moderate pro-choice proponents, who do not take up only the extreme pro-choice view of no abortion restrictions ever, have been relatively silent lately and that chester is one of the only posters to recently be representing the pro-choice side - and doing so in a particularly obnoxious fashion. In my view, such a representative often does more harm than good in winning over converts from the undecided, so I decided to get involved in a likely unresolvable discussion with him just to show some visibility of the moderate pro-choice side. If there were many other discussions going on with other more moderate pro-choice supporters participating, I probably wouldn't have bothered.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:09 PM","abortion-debates","932"

"01-07-2009","11293",63,"Another opinion","339356","That is only the opinion of you and ~10% of other Americans. The rest of us believe that a balance needs to be made and don't share your opinion.","chester","339360","When they began, probably no more than 10% of the colonists supported Washington, Adams, and Jefferson. They were certainly subject to ridicule. When they began, probably no more than 10% of Americans supported Garrison, Phillips, and Lovejoy. They were certainly subject to ridicule, and in fact Lovejoy was murdered. The rest, as they say, is history. There in no force more powerful than an idea whose time has come...Margaret Mead. And, no, I'm not so egotistical as to compare myself with any of those great Americans. BTW, I do not have to convince anyone that the fetus has NO rights; all that I am saying is that they are trumped by the woman's rights every time. It's her call to determine just what rights her fetus has in each case.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:45 PM","abortion-debates","936"

What points of contention are we debating?","Another opinion","339433","As Chester said, the main point of contention is when or if the state can restrict abortion rights at any point in the pregnancy. Unusually for these debates, the current discussion is mainly between various versions of the pro-choice camp. Gansao and I share the majority pro-choice view that would allow full abortion rights for any reason for the first and second trimester, but would restrict third trimester abortion rights to limited exeptions for the sake of the now potentially mentally-existing fetus. Chester and, presumably, Shooterandproud take the more minority absolutist pro-choice stance that abortion rights should never be restricted at any stage of pregnancy for any reason since they view a woman's rights to her body as absolute and trumping any other consideration.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:00 AM","abortion-debates","942"

We hold to the POV that it is up to the woman to assign whatever value she chooses to place on the fetus. We say that, should she choose to protect it from the moment she learns she is pregnant, that we will support her choice. We also say that, should she choose to assign zero value to it until it is born, that we will support that choice as well. It's not her body so much as her choice that we support.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:25 PM","abortion-debates","943"

After all, even if all abortions were outlawed, she would still have the right to assign whatever value she chooses to place on the fetus (after all, there is no ""thought police""), but she would not have the right to act on those thoughts by getting an abortion. Nobody is disputing her rights to have any thoughts she wants about the fetus. Laws restrict people's actions, not their thoughts.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:18 PM","abortion-debates","945"
