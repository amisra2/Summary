"08-18-2008","11293",12,"Another opinion","320432","I am simply saying that, as a pro-choice advocate, I would not be the one pushing for such a vote. If the pro-life side would want such a vote, then they have to push for it. However, the legitimate way of pushing for such a vote would require that they be willing to abide by the results - which is something I do not think the pro-life crowd would be ready to do since most Americans would support first trimester abortion rights. The US Supreme court is there to uphold constitutional rights. Those rights are there to protect our rights from the swings of public opinion, where the public is not necessarily educated on certain subjects. I, for one, am certainly happy that we have this buffer to pure democracy and that one would need a substantial majority to overcome any constitutional ammendment. As for interpretation of the constitution and which interpretations are legitimate, that is too long a subject to get into here... I do not claim that opinion polls show what is right. However, if they are detailed enough, they do give a good impression of how most Americans feel on a wide range of subjects. In a Democracy, ultimately we might end up having to abide by that majority opinion, even if it doesn't fit in with our particular value system. I have seen quite a few posts where people think very ill of abortion while simultaneously supporting abortion rights. So, what one thinks about abortion and how that translates into their expectations in law are two different things. Where polls are concerned, one has to get a feel for the trends and structure the poll based on those trends. Trends show that state of development does matter in peoples minds. Trends show that certain exceptions (ex. rape or risk of death) are almost universally accepted whereas others (ex. risk to mental health) are less so. Trends may show that most people would not view abortion as moral but, simultaneously, may not expect their sense of morality about abortion to be imposed by law. Polls need to therefore be structured based on a full intelligent analysis that takes all these trends into account, not purely to get a desired result by manipulating wording. That may be a tall order, but it seems that some polls are more successfull than others in acheiving this. Then you are saying that there is no poll that you can think of that would address the question of the importance of fetal development on people's opinions about abortion. In any arguement of majority opinion having its say, then I would think that this development-dependence is such a critical issue that one would have to find some way of finding out public opinion. Meanwhile, unless some other poll comes out with better wording, I find the poll that I quoted, imperfect as it may be, still quite revealing about public opinion on the subject of fetal development and abortion rights. That is one reason why I bemoan the fact that there is so little full intelligent public debate on the subject. It is mostly sound bites from either side. In a full intelligent debate, the pro-life side might present such pictures but the pro-choice side would counter that, for early to mid-term, our gut reactions are not based on reality since there is ""nobody home"" yet in those bodies that people wrongly assume suffer based on seeing those photos. The debate could also bring up the issue of potential, or why it is that we protect human life to begin with, or when rights should start, etc. There are many subjects that could be reasonably debated in the public media but, instead, mainly reside in forums such as this.","Steeeeve","320708","You can say there is a legitimate way to do things and an illegitimate way to do things. Furthermore, who would you think the pro-life people wouldn't abide by the results? They abide by the current ""law of the land"" for the most part. This is fine, but I feel the Supreme Court took this issue away from the people where it had been for so long. To do so was illegitimate. Indeed, which is why I stated above you should have a vote on these things...otherwise you say the minority is above the majority...which makes no sense. I'd say it is obvious that most Americans believe abortion is ok in many circumstances. Which is beyond me...seems crazy. I wouldn't go that far...or rather go any farther. I'm sure development does matter to a lot, but what part of develop cannot be known from the polls. It may just be that people feel it should ""look like a person"" or perhaps have eyes or have a brain....you really only know that at 3months 1 day people feel the baby has developed to a point to get rights. Yeah. Which is hypocritical I'm not sure where you are going with this...I know what the polls say. I'm sure you could but it would be very complicated and I doubt very much someone would do it. I suppose you could interview 1,000 people and say ""when exactly do you think abortion should not be allowed and why?"" and then get specifics such as ""oh well when you can see its eyes"" or something. Even then, you could show pictures of different stages of development and might get a different answer. That actually might be interesting. Show a picture of each week with a brief explanation of what characteristics exist at that time (known) and say when does this human get a right to live (assuming the respondent said development). Well, I say it is very limiting. and, of course, the nobody home argument could be countered by saying it would be the same as a 40yr brain damaged guy who would without a doubt recover and regain consciousness. The point of this is that at least you would have educated people on the subject.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:02 PM","abortion-debates","167"

She is carrying it inside her body, and it is feeding off her and will cause her intense pain when it comes out. The fact that you think she should do this against her will is ridiculous. And since she is carrying it, she gets to decide if she wants to call it a baby or a parasite. Is the newborn infant growing inside her body, feeding off of her food and growing? How many times have you gotten pregnant, Galactable? Or how 'bout this. What if you were walking along, having a jolly good day when you were kidnapped. Four men in ski masks push you into a van and drive off while you are blindfolded. They take off your blindfold inside of a mansion, and on the bed you see, lets say, Tom Cruise dying. They forcibly hook you up to a machine that devotes your bodily resources to him. They say you must lie there for the next 18 years, because if you leave before then, Tom Cruise will die. Should this be legal? Now, this is a METAPHOR. This argument can stump a lot of pro-lifers, which leaves them to say ""OMG! how stupid! that can never happen!!!!!"". So, should kidnapping someone and forcing them to devote their bodily resources to someone else, even if they're dying, be legal? And that would be assuming that embryo is a ""person"".","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:22 AM","abortion-debates","174"

The Episiotomy can be dangerous, because it uses a needle near the spinal column. It can result in paralysis. She chose that pain, though.

It means that you are looking at the issue from a childish perspective and do not have enough life experience to fully evaluate the issue. The spinal needle is the epidural, and I have never heard of anyone having a problem as the result of having one. The episiotomy is the incision made to widen the birth canal to ease the birth. As a first time mother, this was not something I chose to have done, the doctor did it automatically. For my second child, I knew better. How many women have died as the result of botched abortions? Now THAT hurts!","Shooterandproud","320772","Do you want to have a mature debate or do you want to keep dismissing my arguments because of my age? I have had plenty of life experience for this debate, and I don't need you telling me otherwise. I can take care of myself. And it seems you are the one looking at it through a childish perspective. Just repeating what I learned in health class. Ok, does this cost money? It does, thank you for proving my point. If abortion is criminalized, then that means more women dying in botched abortions. If a woman doesn't want a bay, she will abort it, legal or not. Safely or with a coat hanger, she will get it done. It seems that I am not the one making childish assumptions. So, do you believe women should be having back alley abortions, or safe abortions? This is another reason why I oppose abortion. Sure, more unwanted children and embryos will live, but women with unwanted pregnancies will either end up emotionally devastated or dead. And you still have not replied to my main argument (the kidnapping one).","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:35 PM","abortion-debates","179"
