"12-23-2008","11293",57,"Winston Smith","337664","I think Archie has said everything he had to say about abortion by now. I respect him for even when everyone is against him, he holds his ground. Of course his ground is shaky but still. Once he was saying that dragons existed and that was hilarious.","Archangel","337802","First of all, Winston, since this is an abortion debate, I don't know how you can say my position on abortion is shaky since apart from my personal spiritual beliefs, we pretty much agree on the abortion issue from what I've read of your beliefs. So if my position is shaky, yours is also. This I find interesting because you are mocking the possibility that Dragons ever existed when I posted evidence of many diverse societies which never communicated with each other due to the limited travel of the time period, and over a large expanse of time, yet testimonials existed from such diverse sources and so far removed described such similar type creatures which they called Dragons. Some of the public records even described them having the ability to direct a venomous type liquid toward their prey which had the effect of burning them like acid and killing them in a very painful manner. No testimonials ever said these creatures shot fire of course, but the result of this spray had the same effect to the witnesses which reported these events to the local authorities which recorded them in public records which have survived the centuries. Here is a link to the alleged legend of Beowulf, according to the original spelling, which explains the historical records which speak to this story we all assume is mythical. I leave it to the reader to interpret the info and decide if it is rational to believe that just because we have no current evidence of Dragons, that means that they never existed. Beowulf and the Creatures of Denmark Here's another link to historical records from the distant past regarding the existence of these allegedly mythical creatures. Living Dinosaurs from Anglo-Saxon and other Early Records My question to you is, why do you find it hilarious that I keep an open mind regarding the possible existence of creatures which were so commonly recorded in ancient public records? And why is your mind so closed to the possibility that these creatures actually existed but are now extinct due to being killed off by early man?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:50 AM","abortion-debates","841"
"12-23-2008","11293",57,"Winston Smith","337727","the problem is that your measuring stick for 'human' is a human being after being born. a human foetus, can only be a 'human' foetus, what else can it be? a dog foetus, a non-human foetus, an extra-terrestial foetus? a human being is always changing from the moment of conception till she/dies to say that a human being can have only the right to live only after a particular arbitrary point in her development was chosen just to justify abortion. This is the crux of the matter. as simple as that","sinjin","337811","My pro-choice position rests on my inability to offer a logical objection to abortion prior to aprrox. 20 weeks gestation. If the thing has yet to come to consciousness, lacks the hardware, who am I to state with certainty that's it's a ""being"". Metaphysics has no place in the law. If someone chooses to reject metaphysics altogether, it's their right. One can't be cruel or inhumane to someone not yet there, any more than someone no longer there. I can't claim potential valid to grant early rights because counting backwards in development gets us to a point of absurdity. Fertilized ovum = person? I can hold these beliefs personally, but can't demand that of others. IMO.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:26 PM","abortion-debates","842"
"12-23-2008","11293",57,"None","None","None","Winston Smith","337819","my position is similar to yours as I have stated ad nauseum in this thread, An abortion ought to be done not past the point when the foetus is conscious and able to feel pain. There is nothing metaphisical involved here by the way, and you destroy something, you destroy a human being in the making. at what point we develop rights that is arbitrary, and for society to decide. Different societies have picked different points.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:37 PM","abortion-debates","843"

To justify being against abortion just because the Bible says so is untenable.

Here's the link: 4Forums.com Political Debates and Polls - View Profile: Archangel The bible and my personal faith establishes my moral boundaries, sure; but I have always debated the abortion issue on its merits as an abused system of birth control for irresponsible women. So feel free to quote posts of me ever relying on the bible as justification for limiting abortions. Ridiculous? You call that refuting the evidence? Just as I thought though, mock that which you can't oppose with rational arguments. You're no better than those who deny that Jesus ever existed in spite of the overwhelming testimony that He did.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:14 PM","abortion-debates","845"

It is true that many affluent women have abortions as a matter of convenience. But one would expect them to know better about birth control. Maybe Gucci, Versace, or Louis Vitton ought to design chic chastity belts ? I don't deny Jesus existence, but imagine if he had entered the city astride a dragon instead of a donkey?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:39 PM","abortion-debates","846"

This is the crux of the matter. as simple as that","Another opinion","337836","You misunderstood my stance. I do not view a fetus/baby as being a human being only once it is born. Since the critical development in my view is the onset of mental existence and this can start to happen around the beginning of the third trimester, then I would say that we could start calling the fetus a human being with rights around the beginning of the third trimester. That is also precisely why I had already stated that I would support limiting third trimester abortion rights to a limited number of exceptions. This point was not chosen arbitrarily. I view the very essence of our existence as people as being our mental existence. It is a core philosophical concept that applies both to the beginning and to the end of life. We start our lives as people at the onset of mental existence and end our lives as people once that mental existence disappears (due to severe brain damage, etc.). Throughout Christian history, similar concepts have been discussed relating to ensoulment or different versions of souls - all resulting from the same thought process that it is the mentality that inhabits the body that is important, not just the body itself. By the way, in this discussion, I use the term ""human being"" as being the same as the term ""person"" - where these terms are equated in various definitions. Other definitions of ""a human"" are more biological, but it is the concept of ""person"" that most relates to the abortion debate. (Note: I may not be able to respond for a while since I will be travelling for a couple of weeks.)","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:22 PM","abortion-debates","847"
