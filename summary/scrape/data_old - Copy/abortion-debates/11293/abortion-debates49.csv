"12-19-2008","11293",49,"Winston Smith","337244","the point is he followed his conscience and that it what matters. the good thing is that at least in Illinois and the UK and Canada, they agree with Antonia that 'murder' is a personal opinion and if that opinion is based on moral grounds it is legal to act according to one's conscience. makes sense doesn't it?","hollyh","337266","I hope his conscious is free from guilt knowing he could have prevented a conception that inevitably ended up in abortion. There would have been no fetus to abort had he not been so negligent. In essence his lack of intervention on behalf of an unconscious, sexually assaulted child caused a pregnancy to result when one could have been prevented. He wasn't being expected to abort, he was however expected to prevent conception from occurring as within the treatment guidelines of every admitted rape victim. He willfully ignored this. The defense made him responsible for retribution of personal damages on behalf of the victim due to his negligence including now having to experience an abortion. Plus a multitude of other claims. The doctor created a situation for a procedure he was so against. Ironic. Like i said, they won, it turns out religious morality as a defense for medical negligence wasn't so legal after all. Medicine and its practice is legally free from religious morality. We cant exactly have mormon doctors running around refusing blood transfers can we?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:15 AM","abortion-debates","721"
"12-19-2008","11293",49,"None","None","None","Winston Smith","337269","why do you think that one's conscience is the product of religious beliefs? I have always had a sense of right and wrong even as a child, and it has never had anything to do with religious belief. Are you saying that atheists have no moral sense? Mormons have no objection to 'spilling blood' it is the Jehova Witnesses. But you made a good point. I don't know if there are any medical practicioners who are Jehova Witnesses.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:56 AM","abortion-debates","722"
"12-19-2008","11293",49,"hollyh","337247","You have provided evidence of facts not truth, and even then scientists believed the world was flat at one point, this was acknowledged as fact or truth if thats what you chose to name it. Funnily enough it was disproved and the opinions of this fact/truth changed with it.","Winston Smith","337270","not because some people thought the Earth was flat, it was true. Are you disputing by the way that the Earth is closer to an sphere than to a flat plane? maybe people will tire of this 'truth' and will decide that the Earth is flat once again? Maybe they will also think one day that airplanes can't fly and the planes will fall off the sky, right?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:02 AM","abortion-debates","723"

"12-19-2008","11293",49,"Winston Smith","337240","you are not bad you know. But the characters in a play are just imaginary beings. Wait some months after conception and you have a born human being. you are comparing life with fiction.","antonia","337310","You miss the point of the metaphor. I am comparing genetic information -- what nononsense calls our individuality -- with theatre that has not been performed. The data is there, but the actors are not. The play is on paper, the way coding is in a cell. A person does not yet exist. Nor does a Broadway, off-Broadway, or off-off-off-off Broadway show. I, as the writer, can throw even -- what others may consider -- a masterpiece in the fire. For whatever reason suits my fancy. On the other hand, if, in a fit of creative angst, while the play is performed on Cornelia Street, I run into the theatre and start shooting the actors -- I am commiting murder. But before that -- on paper -- while it may be valued in some way -- and disturbing to see it go up in smoke -- I have only put paper in fire. And the ""creative product"" is mine to do that with.

"12-19-2008","11293",49,"nononsense","337242","You can write a play, perhaps, but can you write a double-helix DNA strand and have it accurate and meaningful? The common factor present in all living organisms, from bacteria to man, is the information contained in all their cells. It hs been discovered that nowhere else can a higher statistical packing density of information be found than that found in DNA. Who is the author of this DNA?","antonia","337316","This is a question of faith. There may not be any ""author"" in this respect. And, even if there were an author, he may have signed over the copyright. The woman is the person who has to decide, ""Is this a production that's going to fly or not? And whether it is or isn't, do I want to go through this?"" It's quite an undertaking -- and to dictate for others.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:00 PM","abortion-debates","728"

Sorry if i confused you i was really only referring to the case at hand.","antonia","337337","There was some story about a private Catholic hospital -- not offering the option of emergency contraception to rape victims. And when they were the only hospital in town ... I don't recall the entire story ... But in this case, the hospital was dictating policy to the doctors and staff -- whatever their views on the right to choose -- which, in any case, is the law. Whatever the hospital administration believes. I think some jobs -- if you are morally opposed -- you don't do the job, period. We have conscientious objectors in war. They're o.k. with some of the functions of a soldier, but they don't head down to the local Uncle Sam office and volunteer if they don't feel o.k. about other things soldiers do. Likewise, if you're a Christian Scientist -- you don't become a nurse. If the U.S. were a tiny country like the Netherlands, it might be possible to entirely separate reproductive medical services from hospitals -- and still provide reproductive medical services throughout the country, without discriminating against poorer women. (As has happened in the U.S. since Jim Carter and his delusions.) But we don't seem to be in a position to do that. So I would say, if you don't believe in certain forms of contraception or legal medical practices, then don't work in that field -- or practice in a way that doesn't require you to compromise your principles -- but doesn't compromise the safety and well-being of everyone else. That is, go to a big city, open your own office, and hang a sign declaring your opposition to certain forms of prescription drugs or medical practices. Or just stay in a specialty that doesn't go near it, ever.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:40 PM","abortion-debates","729"

And as you well know many health professionals consider abortion murder, and won't have murder on their conscience.

But the point of the metaphor is to illuminate an aspect of reality as far as we know it. That point being, that the genetic coding in a cell is not a person at a later date in time. Then they should not have one, and certainly stay away from any field of medicine where they would have to compromise themselves.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:12 PM","abortion-debates","731"

Science does away with metaphors' However, let's have a closer look at your metaphor, it was ill chosen for in real life the character in the play becomes the actor in the play. There is no duality of existence, just life or death The opposite is true, to act against one's conscience is to compromise oneself. But, yes I agree with you on this.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:27 PM","abortion-debates","733"

The RCC has such deep roots there, people are confused about where the secular world leaves off and the religious one begins.","Winston Smith","337370","my moral position on abortion has nothing to do with religion. It seems inconceivable to you that my morality is not based on religion but, it is, and what about you? is you conscience based on the tenets of a particular religion? I have explained ad nauseum my position but you still refuse to accept it: There is no discontinuity (it would be absurd) between an adult human being and one just conceived, just different stages of development. The weakness of your position is that where you draw the line between 'it' and 'she' is purely arbitrary, a matter of expediency. You could also commit infanticide and say that what you killed was not a human being. This is not moral relativism this is sophism of the worst kind. I am not confused at all with the separation of the secular and religious. Chile for your information has a constitutional separation of Church and State going back to the XIX century. The morning after pill is legal and so is divorce. Perhaps in Chile we value human life more than you do? as simple as that. By the way, although I have lived most of my life in Australia, that is irrelevant, for although I was educated by the Jesuits (good thinkers) even at high school I was excused from going to Mass because my teachers gave up on me. I was declared a non-believer and joined the rank of a few other students who were excused from participation in religious activities. However I remember that a course I took in high school on the history of ideas and philosophy by a Jesuit teacher was totally devoid of any religious bias and it was great. So I have fond memories of the Jesuits. Reason works as well in Chile as anywhere else.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:49 PM","abortion-debates","734"

Who cares what she has to say, it matters not. She acts like there is a point of view to win over other points of view, but if you don't believe in truth there is no point in arguing! But there is truth. There are morals to live up to. There are beliefs which are truly beneficial to society, and some that pretend to be.....drawing the distinction is what this talk is all about.
