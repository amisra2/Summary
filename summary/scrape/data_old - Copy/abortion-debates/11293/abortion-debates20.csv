"08-29-2008","11293",20,"jyoshu","321775","So you've changed your position from what you indicated in post #231? I quote: ( ""The one child rule is far from evil. It is quite necessary in china, however I propose a 2 child rule in America, maybe 3 (with the exception of adoption)."" ) You made it pretty clear you support the government regulating pregnancies in THAT post, even going so far as to propose how many children the govt. should limit people to. Are you now saying you've changed your view on that? From what I read here, the only one that's proposed the government placing limits here is yourself. [shrug] Also, I didn't call you totalitarian. I said you are supporting a totalitarian view with your argument there, and you are .","Shooterandproud","321814","Um, no. But nowhere did I say it was necessary at this moment. I did say that for china, because it is. At some point, we can not keep our lifestyle of ""going fourth and multiply"", and it will ultimately come down to who's rights matter more. Those of the people already born, or those of the people that are somehow opposed to using rubbers. So are you, and you are therefore hypocritical by that statement. You seek to force women to carry children in their uterus. This is the abortion forum and we are debating on an abortion topic, and it was my fault for getting off topic. Lets get back on topic, but I'd be happy to debate this with you somewhere else.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:44 PM","abortion-debates","288"
"08-29-2008","11293",20,"Galactababe","321798","Shooterandproud: So how's that list coming Shooter? Let's see, who agrees with you on governmental population control? Chester Nope. It hasn't gotten any bigger. Oh well.","Shooterandproud","321815","Lets see who agrees with you on you totalitarian government forcing women to carry pregnancies: Jyoshu Nope. It hasn't gotten any bigger. Oh well.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:46 PM","abortion-debates","289"
"08-29-2008","11293",20,"CUNxTime","321484","I liken Communism to a religion. It fools the masses into believing in a fiction, ie. a benovelent despot, while the priest class, ie. the party/government officers, live high on the hog. The various communist countries that have ever existed were led by tyrants dresses up in populist robes. It's all ####, it doesn't work and never will. More Government = more corruption and communism is the ultimate Big Government. It (attempts to) suppress a person's natural inclination and is doomed to fail.","gman","321818","Well put Cunx. Communism and religion do fool the masses. The difference being that fooling the people actually is the agenda of Communism where as those doing the fooling in religion do not accurately represent the God they claim to represent. Proclaiming one's self as a representative of God, does not make one so.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:19 PM","abortion-debates","290"

Brought on by different avenues. The U.S.'s situation brought on by decadence, China's by indifference and ignorance. Both by absence of education.

That's the problem. Its the media that's doing this, and money is being taken from schools in budget cuts of all sorts to put more money in the taxpayer's pockets and pay for this Iraq war. The need for Sex Ed is now more than ever.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:17 PM","abortion-debates","292"

It's not murder until you have a born person. But I understand that's too difficult a concept for you.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:14 PM","abortion-debates","294"

And frankly, I wasn't keeping count on the pro-lifers in this forum, but I've already got your list of commie supporters beat... LOL!","Shooterandproud","321920","The one that isn't here, and has lost credibility with nearly all of the posters on this forum? Oh yea. Forgot. Wow is all I can say. There are very few communists on this forum, and calling anyone who disagrees with you a ""commie"" only reveals your childish nature. You continue to support the government telling women what to do and not do while pregnant, and you still throw the word ""commie"" around? So far, the only Pro-Lifer that is not a hypocritical child that uses petty names and cheap shots for their own personal gain is Jyoshu. Is that what your party has come to?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:32 PM","abortion-debates","295"

If you find that categorization of your beliefs which you have blathered ad nauseum offensive, then I suggest you re-evaluate what it is you truly believe.","Shooterandproud","321997","Please don't try to prove I'm a communist. You've already failed. Chester believes what he believes, some I agree with, and some I don't.

They believe that, since they march in lockstep, those of us who are proud progressives must also. BTW, The Denver Post today ran thumbnail sketches of the Colorado delegation to the Repubbies' convention. You would have to look long and hard to find a black or Latino delegate, and yet blacks and Latinos make up ~30% of our population.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:54 PM","abortion-debates","298"
