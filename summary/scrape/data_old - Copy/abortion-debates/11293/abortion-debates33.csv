Sure, its cool, but it happens every day in all kinds of organisms. It doesn't mean we must bend over backwards and sacrifice the rights of the real humans just so we can have 1.4 million unwanted babies in the country. If you want to talk about how cool cells are, fine. Just don't use it as an excuse to support anti-abortionism.","nononsense","335431","From the moment the sperm enters the egg a chain of events take place in a timely manner. Every cell has a purpose. How is it possible that embryonic development does not entail a disorderly growth of cells, but is systematic and purposeful according to a set timetable? A precise plan in which all stages are programmed in the finest detail, underlies all these processes. How do you account for such intricate workings? According to the Laws of Information, every piece of information must have a sender. I responded to the posters notion that cells are insignificant. He obviously lacked the ability to intelligently explain his position, however, I tried to draw out more by asking a simple question. Everyone knows that at the beginning of conception there is cell division. But what is in the cells? What about the DNA which are coded at that time to determine the individual characteristics of the new human? Most people find that fascinating. There is a lot to it. I would like to talk about these things because they are fundamental to the topic. If we do not adequately answer these questions then there is no reason to be talking about killing this new human being which did not exist, but now exists....the euphamism you use is abortion. There is no need to be condescending in your response. Nononsense","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:01 PM","abortion-debates","481"

PS, it's not a person until it's born. Now, answer the money question, please. Answer the question about intrusive government, please.","nononsense","335434","Now you are just showing that you have no argument. I think you have lost the argument.

Cells are relevant to this debate, however I think every one of us on both sides knows how babies are made. Otherwise we wouldn't be here. I am trying to tell you that we all already know how cells divide. We must now focus on how that is relevant to the abortion debate.

Who will police matters should abortion be outlawed? 2. How they will do so? and 3. The costs in actual tax dollars it will take to do so. All we see is pontification and bloviation about the sacred zygote. How about trying to live in the real world? Adopting one of the children you worked so hard to ""save"" might be a good first step. My oldest son is adopted, and that is a real world solution. Do you have the courage to take the same step?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:49 AM","abortion-debates","484"

Nevertheless, I will answer the 3 non-relevant questions just because I wanted to respond to this post to remind everyone that Chester has been banned from these forums several times and should probably be ignored for the most part. Answers: 1. The police 2. The same way they did when abortion was illegal 3. Depends on how many people break the law. Probably similar to when abortion was illegal plus adjustments for inflation.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:00 AM","abortion-debates","485"

After all, this is actions we are discussing that involve both the police power and the taxing power of the government. Hypothetical: If the USA outlaws abortion and Canada does not (They always were more enlightened than we.), do you advocate for pregnancy police at the border to check the status of every woman of child bearing age upon leaving and reentering the USA?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:09 AM","abortion-debates","486"

"12-06-2008","11293",33,"Phyllis","335561","Nevertheless, there is only a double standard if I advocate such methods in a similar situation, say if someone wanted to cross the border into Canada in order to murder a Canadian, or their born child.

All this time we thought that you would demand that we bear any burden, pay any price to bring an end to such depravity.
