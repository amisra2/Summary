If you were to say to me, ""You think like a middle-aged woman"", would that be belittling me? Now, if I were to say, ""You think like a retarded child,"" THAT would be belittling. But I've said no such thing. Furthermore, stating my argument has failed, doesn't make it so. ;-) And it would become easier and less expensive if more American babies became available instead of being tossed aside as biowaste. Uh, ok. You also ignored my point that many bikers today blatantly ignore the rules of the road, (have unprotected sex), ride 3 abreast (selfishness) and then sometimes get hit (knocked up). It's not a matter of do they get medical care or not. It's a matter of how do they choose to deal with the result of their irresponsible actions? It is ""medical care"" whether they go for the quick fix (abortion) or a longer hospital stay and rehab (deliver). But ask yourself this: If the biker can get a quick fix compared with a longer hospital stay, after he's all better, which situation would probably result in him riding 3 abreast again?","Shooterandproud","321082","Where I come from, when you call someone a name it is not called ""factual"". Saying I think like my age is different than calling me immature. Are you incorrectly referring to a fetus as a baby or do you actually mean babies being tossed as biowaste? You have also ignored that even more cars break the rules of the road, and get hit. And the whole biking thing was not some kind of abortion analogy. I was stating that there is risk in everything, however by taking that risk you are not always responsible for what ever happens to you. If you join the military is it perfectly OK when and if you die? The military's sole purpose is to fight, and fighting results in dying. So, does that mean nothing should be done to increase the safety of our troops? The quick fix would be taking an ambulance to a hospital (abortion), or dragging yourself their and risking permanent injury on the way (delivering and raising a kid or putting it up for adoption). I say, let the biker choose what kind of medical care he got, instead of letting the government decide what care he should get, which is not always in his best interests. And sometimes the government decides to give him the least medical care in the name of ""morality"", so his legs will be incapacitated for the next 18 years, and will never be able to ride 3 abreast again. Have you also considered the wider implications of an abortion ban? Like the thousands more born people that will be dying of respiratory failure from all the pollution spewed from the 1.4 million more people? Maybe the land that will have to be destroyed and made into landfills to handle all their trash? What about all the sea creatures that will die as a result of all the more water pollution? Have you considered the species that will go extinct, and throw our ecosystem off balance? You repeatedly call me immature, and belittle my by saying I think like a child however you fail to comprehend the wider implications of what you are proposing.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:10 PM","abortion-debates","226"

Here is the foundation upon which Planned Parenthood was built. Now just watch shooter deny reality and attempt to defend against this documented history of what he supports so staunchly and easily. Here's page 1 of this disgusting history of what this racist woman and Planned Parenthood represents. (This article first appeared in the January 20, 1992 edition of Citizen magazine) How Planned Parenthood Duped America At a March 1925 international birth control gathering in New York City, a speaker warned of the menace posed by the ""black"" and ""yellow"" peril. The man was not a Nazi or Klansman; he was Dr. S. Adolphus Knopf, a member of Margaret Sanger's American Birth Control League (ABCL), which along with other groups eventually became known as Planned Parenthood. Sanger's other colleagues included avowed and sophisticated racists. One, Lothrop Stoddard, was a Harvard graduate and the author of The Rising Tide of Color against White Supremacy. Stoddard was something of a Nazi enthusiast who described the eugenic practices of the Third Reich as ""scientific"" and ""humanitarian."" And Dr. Harry Laughlin, another Sanger associate and board member for her group, spoke of purifying America's human ""breeding stock"" and purging America's ""bad strains."" These ""strains"" included the ""shiftless, ignorant, and worthless class of antisocial whites of the South."" Not to be outdone by her followers, Margaret Sanger spoke of sterilizing those she designated as ""unfit,"" a plan she said would be the ""salvation of American civilization.: And she also spike of those who were ""irresponsible and reckless,"" among whom she included those "" whose religious scruples prevent their exercising control over their numbers."" She further contended that ""there is no doubt in the minds of all thinking people that the procreation of this group should be stopped."" That many Americans of African origin constituted a segment of Sanger considered ""unfit"" cannot be easily refuted. While Planned Parenthood's current apologists try to place some distance between the eugenics and birth control movements, history definitively says otherwise. The eugenic theme figured prominently in the Birth Control Review, which Sanger founded in 1917. She published such articles as ""Some Moral Aspects of Eugenics"" (June 1920), ""The Eugenic Conscience"" (February 1921), ""The purpose of Eugenics"" (December 1924), ""Birth Control and Positive Eugenics"" (July 1925), ""Birth Control: The True Eugenics"" (August 1928), and many others. These eugenic and racial origins are hardly what most people associate with the modern Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), which gave its Margaret Sanger award to the late Dr. Martin Luther King in 1966, and whose current president, Faye Wattleton, is black, a former nurse, and attractive. Though once a social pariah group, routinely castigated by religious and government leaders, the PPFA is now an established, high-profile, well-funded organization with ample organizational and ideological support in high places of American society and government. Its statistics are accepted by major media and public health officials as ""gospel""; its full-page ads appear in major newspapers; its spokespeople are called upon to give authoritative analyses of what America's family policies should be and to prescribe official answers that congressmen, state legislator and Supreme Court justiices all accept as ""social orthodoxy."" Blaming Families Sanger's obsession with eugenics can be traced back to her own family. One of 11 children, she wrote in the autobiographical book, My Fight for Birth Control, that ""I associated poverty, toil, unemployment, drunkenness, cruelty, quarreling, fighting, debts, jails with large families."" Just as important was the impression in her childhood of an inferior family status, exacerbated by the iconoclastic, ""free-thinking"" views of her father, whose ""anti-Catholic attitudes did not make for his popularity"" in a predominantly Irish community. The fact that the wealthy families in her hometown of Corning, N.Y., had relatively few children, Sanger took as prima facie evidence of the impoverishing effect of larger families. The personal impact of this belief was heightened 1899, at the age of 48. Sanger was convinced that the ""ordeals of motherhood"" had caused the death of her mother. The lingering consumption (tuberculosis) that took her mother's life visited Sanger at the birth of her own first child on Nov. 18, 1905. The diagnosis forced her to seek refuge in the Adirondacks to strengthen her for the impending birth. Despite the precautions, the birth of baby Grant was ""agonizing,"" the mere memory of which Sanger described as ""mental torture"" more than 25 years later. She once described the experience as a factor ""to be reckoned with"" in her zealous campaign for birth control. From the beginning, Sanger advocacy of sex education reflected her interest in population control and birth prevention among the ""unfit."" Her first handbook, published for adolescents in 1915 and entitled, What Every Boy and Girl Should Know, featured a jarring afterword: It is a vicious cycle; ignorance breeds poverty and poverty breeds ignorance. There is only one cure for both, and that is to stoop breeding these things. Stop bringing to birth children whose inheritance cannot be one of health or intelligence. Stop bringing into the world children whose parents cannot provide for them. To Sanger, the ebbing away of moral and religious codes over sexual conduct was a natural consequence of the worthlessness of such codes in the individual's search for self-fulfillment. ""Instead of laying down hard and fast rules of sexual conduct,"" Sanger wrote in her 1922 book Pivot of Civilization, ""sex can be rendered effective and valuable only as it meets and satisfies the interests and demands of the pupil himself."" Her attitude is appropriately described as libertinism, but sex knowledge was not the same as individual liberty, as her writings on procreation emphasized. The second edition of Sanger's life story, An Autobiography, appeared in 1938. There Sanger described her first cross-country lecture tour in 1916. Her standard speech asserted seven conditions of life that ""mandated"" the use of birth control: the third was ""when parents, though normal, had subnormal children""; the fourth, ""when husband and wife were adolescent""; the fifth, ""when the earning capacity of the father was inadequate."" No right existed to exercise sex knowledge to advance procreation. Sanger described the fact that ""anyone, no matter how ignorant, how diseased mentally or physically, how lacking in all knowledge of children, seemed to consider he or she had the right to become a parent."" Religious Bigotry In the 1910's and 1920's, the entire social orderreligion, law, politics, medicine, and the mediawas arrayed against the idea and practice of birth control. This opposition began in 1873 when an overwhelmingly Protestant Congress passed, and a Protestant president signed into law, a bill that became known as the Comstock Law, named after its main proponent, Anthony Comstock. The U.S. Congress classified obscene writing, along with drugs, and devices and articles that prevented conception or caused abortion, under the same net of criminality and forbade their importation or mailing. Sanger set out to have such legislation abolished or amended. Her initial efforts were directed at the Congress with the opening of a Washington, D.C., office of her American Birth Control League in 1926. Sanger wanted to amend section 211 of the U.S. criminal code to allow the interstate shipment and mailing of contraceptives among physicians, druggists and drug manufacturers. http://www.blackgenocide.org/sanger.html","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:22 PM","abortion-debates","236"
"08-23-2008","11293",16,"Galactababe","321165","Shooterandproud: Well jr., your sense of smell is as broken as your morals. I was raised by Jewish parents, married a lapsed Catholic and have raised our children as ""truthseekers"" - providing them with the Old and the New Testaments, but belonging to no formal church or temple. You think it's okay for a fascist regime to dictate how many children a family can have, ""for the sake of the planet"". I suppose it's also okay with you for a fascist government to tell those children that are lucky enough to be born what they can read, what they can say and what they should believe in order for them to be ""happy"". A government seeking to control a married couple's God given RIGHT to ""go forth and multiply"" is anti-religion. Our country was founded on our ""inalienable rights as granted by our Creator"" to ""LIFE, liberty and pursuit of happiness"". If you've got a problem with that, go live in Venezuela, Cuba or China and see how successful you are at achieving happiness in a communist country. You should be ashamed of yourself, seriously. You are the hypocrite, demanding for American women the ""right to choose"" to abort on the one hand, and condoning communist governmental sterilization","Shooterandproud","321176","Oh woe is me. A religious nut claimed my morality was broken. That's great, however what if your children decide not to become christian? Buddhist maybe? And you want to take away woman's right to her body because of a clump of growing cells in her uterus. Where did I say they should believe in something? This is like saying the government is telling children that theft is wrong, and some nut claiming that they are dictating how to think in order to be happy. Doesn't hold up. ""Truth seeker"", eh? Don't I remember something in our constitution about separation of church and state? So you have the right to have 6 children, and all of our tax dollars should be used to educate them instead of doing something productive like maybe feeding the poor. Those six children have the right to take away another child's God given RIGHT to have clean air clean water, have enough food to eat, and to live a good life. Will more and more people cramming into this planet's limited space, it will not be able to feed everyone, our natural resources will run out, and it will eventually turn into a Sh** hole of pollution and waste. What makes you think you can take away my God given RIGHT to a clean place to live, and enough money to feed my future children? What about their rights? The 6 children families taking up all of our natural resources? Wheres my rights? Wheres my grand children's rights? Your arguments are pretty sick. 6 children families may have been OK 100 years ago, but they are not now. Condoms are free. You fail to consider the rights of the rest of the world and will force women to carry fetuses in their uterus and I should be ashamed of myself? Tell you and your Islamist and Fundie Christian friends that If they want to have 6+ children, they should be fruitful in someone else's country. I believe in the basic human right to ones body, while you cannot grasp that concept. You know that the other person's argument has failed when they erect strawmen and call you a communist. Funny, I'm the one being called a communist by someone who thinks its perfectly OK to allow the government to force women to have babies.
