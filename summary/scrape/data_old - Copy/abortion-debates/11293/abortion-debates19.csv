"08-27-2008","11293",19,"jyoshu","321598","I think this argument (that I've heard from other pro-choicers before too, BTW) really gets into questionable ethics. I wonder if pro-choicers have really thought this through before they make it. (I actually hope they haven't!) See, on one hand you believe that the concept of life--viable human life--doesn't really apply at the embryonic stage. Or if you do, then it's not applicable enough to consider such abortion murder. But by arguing for abortion based on some of the BABIES in the world, in orphanages, then you're using an example of VIABLE human life to argue against the pro-life position. Of all the arguments I hear on behalf of the pro-choice position, this one has to be the worst of all. Abort 'em early because we don't want too many babies clogging up the system ... that's basically what you're saying. No longer does your argument have anything to do with a woman's right to choose--it's all about the system which is a much broader issue with a host of other problems and possible solutions. You've abandoned your best focus of argumentation--that women should be able to keep or not keep their pregnancy. Using one social problem to fix another isn't the answer to crowded orphanages. Even many on the left feel that abortion should be rare and be reduced.","Shooterandproud","321636","Correct, because choicers usually believe that born human beings deserve priority over the unborn. Yes, I am. Since we can't kill anyone, preventing people from being born seems like the best and most humane way to do it. Embryos and early fetuses are not human beings, they are embryos and early fetuses. Is it necessary that there be one and only one argument for supporting choice? This argument is just one of the many. The right of the women is the first and foremost. The right of born children to have families and be fed and clothed is the next. Please quote me on where I said I had ""abandoned"" anything.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:23 PM","abortion-debates","272"

Your argument is not just about preventing pregnancy at this point--it's about preventing viable babies . By focusing on preventing actual babies, it's babies you're now talking about, not just embryos. That's why your argument isn't really as popular an approach among pro-choicers. It's the sort of mentality we see sometimes in totalitarianism. 'Since we can't kill anyone'? Honestly, are you even listening to what you're saying here?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:52 AM","abortion-debates","274"

If someone were to get pregnant, and not want the baby to be born, then it should not be allowed to be born, because it goes against the rights of the born, and the mother. No, I am talking about ebmryos and them being in that stage of development. I'm not talking about what may happen if it is allowed to grow. Sure, that may happen, but I'm not talking about it because to me it is not important. What is important to me is its development at a certain point in time. Am I actually being called by someone who wants to regulate pregnancies by telling women what the can and can't do during pregnancy a totalitarian thinker? Of course I am. Unless you can prove to me that human beings with mental existences are being legally murdered every year, I am correct.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:56 PM","abortion-debates","277"

Because that IS an example of what could happen if they are allowed to grow. You certainly DID speak of what may happen if it is allowed to grow. Well, you used the example. I can only go on what you said. Well, when your arguments are basically another form of totalitarianism, then yes. You're talking about population control, and indicated support earlier for such ideas as limiting couples to one baby. That's a form of totalitarianism.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:33 AM","abortion-debates","279"

"08-29-2008","11293",19,"Shooterandproud","321759","Population control? Maybe if things get really bad. But I'm hoping it won't come to that. On this debate we are talking about abortion rights. Who is the one arguing for the government to go out of its reach and determine the future of a woman's pregnancy? I'm only talking about population control when it's necessary, such as when there are food shortages or when the atmosphere and oceans can take much more of our ####. However, the government regulating pregnancies is never necessary or OK. In any case, we are debating abortion rights and you are the one who is in favor of the government stepping in and taking away rights that women once had, correct? Therefore you have no right to call me ""totalitarian"", at least not in this debate.","jyoshu","321775","So you've changed your position from what you indicated in post #231? I quote: ( ""The one child rule is far from evil. It is quite necessary in china, however I propose a 2 child rule in America, maybe 3 (with the exception of adoption)."" ) You made it pretty clear you support the government regulating pregnancies in THAT post, even going so far as to propose how many children the govt. should limit people to. Are you now saying you've changed your view on that? From what I read here, the only one that's proposed the government placing limits here is yourself. [shrug] Also, I didn't call you totalitarian. I said you are supporting a totalitarian view with your argument there, and you are .","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:54 PM","abortion-debates","282"

Despite knowing in utero that this precious baby had Down's Syndrome, as a sitting Governor of the State of Alaska, as Commander of the Alaskan National Guard, she CHOSE to bring that special life into this world!","chester","321803","Could not agree more, as do most pro-choice people. What infuriates me is that, given her experience of choice, she would then try to deprive other women of different choices. Then again, no one has a right to expect logic from the hard right lunatic radical fringe in the USA.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:21 PM","abortion-debates","285"
