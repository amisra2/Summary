Compromise can be a wonderful thing.","Another opinion","320196","Since the terms you proposed are already the ones favored by the great majority of the pro-life side, I see no ""compromise"" here. Do you understand what the term ""compromise"" means? It means that both sides give in and meet in the middle. What would you be willing to give up in a compromise?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:04 PM","abortion-debates","106"
"08-13-2008","11293",8,"Shooterandproud","320191","I got a compromise for ya. How about you, and everyone else who does not like or disagrees with abortion just not have one? We won't force you to have an abortion if you don't force the rest of America not to have one, ok?","chester","320197","Simple and elegant. Too bad the screamers here won't accept anything but their way, as long, of course, as they don't have to put any skin in the game.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:05 PM","abortion-debates","107"

Maybe now you can give us the distinction between intent and meaning , especially since you ran like a thief in the night when you were asked the distinction on another forum.","chester","320203","Let's look at Black's Law Dictionary shall we. INTENT : ""Design, resolve, or determination with which a person acts"" MEANING : ""That which is intended to be, signified or denoted by act or language"" See, you silly goose, they are one and the same.

"08-13-2008","11293",8,"Galactababe","320214","Another opinion: Open your eyes. Pro-Lifers, as a rule, oppose abortion under any circumstances. My proposal allows abortions for rape victims and mothers whose lives are endangered by the pregnancy. Continue to allow abortions to be performed in clean, accredited hospitals, but attach fines payable by both the doctor and the patient to the procedure. Pool that money and help pay the medical and legal expenses of those mothers that carry the baby to full term and put it up for adoption.","chester","320223","Provided that the adoptive parent(s) are taken from the ranks of profetallifers, maybe we have a start. Those who rail so much against abortion need to have considerable skin in the game for it to be a real compromise. Agreed? Do you really think the profetallifers will go for a mere FINE for the taking of ""an innocent life""?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:00 PM","abortion-debates","111"
"08-13-2008","11293",8,"None","None","None","Galactababe","320238","Chester: I think that many adoptive parents are very much pro-lifers, but I don't think that need be a ""condition"" to be able to adopt. I also wouldn't impose just a ""mere"" fine, it would be a very stiff fine so both the doctor and the patient would pay. Can you put a price on the life of a viable fetus? No, but it would serve as a major deterrent.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:28 PM","abortion-debates","112"

Be that as it may, I am quite proud of my adopted son. He had some difficulties as a teen, but for the past 17 years he has worked at a job he loves and which brings him respect. The point is that your proposed compromise must include a provision REQUIRING so-called righttofetallifers to adopt. That will give them a real stake in what they are preaching. For the record, how does your proposal deal with the cases where a pregnant woman travels from her home state to another to terminate her pregnancy? How do you plan to deal with the woman who cannot afford to pay the ""very stiff fine"", much less raise a child? Will you have pregnancy police at the border? What powers will they have? Can you not see the Big Brother implications of your seemingly oh-so-neutral compromise?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:54 PM","abortion-debates","113"

Don't tell me there are men so ignorant in this country that they don't know what the Trojan dispenser in the men's bathroom is for!","Shooterandproud","320244","In my whole life I have only seen one trojan dispenser in a bathroom. What if the men aren't educated. What if all they were taught in school is that christian ""abstinence"" ####? What if they knew what a condom was but didn't know how important it was to use one?
