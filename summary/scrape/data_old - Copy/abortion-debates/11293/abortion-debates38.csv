"12-10-2008","11293",38,"simone","336197","Ross Douthat, senior editor at The Atlantic, co-authored Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream , makes an absoolutist statement in the way he claims the absolutism of the pro-choice movement: http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/op...07douthat.html No Compromise. Dunno. For some reason this sounds like Absolutism to me.","chester","336203","It's not going to happen. President Obama will have at least 3 SCOTUS nominations in his first 2 years (Stevens, Ginsburg, and Kennedy). After that, if the nation is fortunate, Scalia will resign in a huff, to be followed closely by Uncle Clarence. Souter and Breyer are solid for the right to choose; Roberts and Alito are solid the other way, and the majority will come out at least 6-3 Pro-Choice.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:19 PM","abortion-debates","556"

Not to mention a number of la-la lands of his/her own.","Winston Smith","336222","Bravo Antonia, it didn't take you long to abandon arguments in favor of ad hominem attacks. As you know well: I am not a believer, I am agnostic, so theism has never entered in my support of the killing of unborn babies. I told you I am against abortion after the third trimester and at this time we are talking about a foetus who feels pain, not a cygot. what you posted above is evidence to me that you are dishonest.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:33 AM","abortion-debates","558"
"12-11-2008","11293",38,"antonia","336210","Pure propaganda. American sentiments on abortion are not muddied. This writer's perceptions are. 65% support Roe, which is not even pro-choice ""maximalism"". One of the reasons the Republicans still can't get their grand old party back up and running. In spite of those statistics, they're still trying to sell the nation anti-choice maximalists like Sarah Palin. Even after they lost by a landslide. The party of unreason right down to their own political strategizing. Unable to accept the evidence, as is, right before their eyes.","Winston Smith","336223","and what are the choices? to kill or not to kill. That is playing God.

""imagine walking into a hospital of newborns and stabbing one. that's what abortion is. it's murder. plain and simple. besides THERE's like 6 ways to not get pregant other than not opening your legs to begin with.","Winston Smith","336224","is it so hard for women to keep their legs crossed? the only women's leg openers I know apart from rape, are lust and/or money.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:39 AM","abortion-debates","560"

Nor does telling you as much constitute an ad hominen. No you told me you were against abortion after the second trimester. But that you didn't think it was right during the first trimester, either. You said it was ""a heinous crime."" What you post shows me that you don't understand the nature of evidence. let alone when you employ ad hominems yourself. Or when you post false information about prior posts, as you did in the last one. Do I give you yourself standing ovation? You appear rather dishonest in attempting to deploy your own failings unto others. Rather than simply own up to the stupid games you started playing with me, and as soon I started posting on the religion forum. The point is, your views on abortion are religious. Tough, if you don't like hearing it. At least, some people are honest about where they're coming from. They don't try to pretend they have a corner on rational truth, when it's not rational. They simply say, ""It's my faith."" But your maps are all mixed up, aren't they. You don't know when you're driving with reason and evidence, and when you're driving with faith. And because you're so identified with this notion of yourself as a fashionable ""agnostic"", it's impossible for you to be anything but rational.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:49 AM","abortion-debates","561"

I meant first trimester, but you are just nickpicking I don't understand the nature of evidence?, what evidence is that? . I have never played games with you, what are you talking about? I have always treated you with respect and still do. I have answered you honestly and truthfully and have not insulted or put words in your mouth. The above does not apply to me, rather to you show me one of my posts that were faith driven and irrational. so agnosticism is fashionable? you are being very silly Antonia. instead of more ad hominem you ought to come with some arguments justifying killing unborn babies, after the first trimester. face humanity is there from the moment of conception, from the moment of conception a human being is in the making. If you want to kill her at least have the compassion of doing before it experiences pain, and to experience pain one must be conscious, right?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:26 AM","abortion-debates","563"
