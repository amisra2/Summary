The Ten Commandments are sound moral principals. God never fails. However, there are groups dedicated to fighting all things related to Christianity, and they promote lies. Sadly our history is being revised. Today very few Americans know their own history. Again, sad.","chester","337107","Here we go again. A poster who insists that not only Christianity, but HER VERSION of Christianity is what forms the basis of American civil law. Kindly tell us in what respects your view differs from that of the Taliban. After all, they believe that their beliefs should form the basis of the civil law as well. BTW, if Christianity and the Master's words are so clear, why are there so many competing sects?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:37 AM","abortion-debates","661"

To be fair though, i would ensure ECP was administered asap to ensure no conception would even occur. There would be no spawn to consider.","Winston Smith","337113","OK. it is your body after all.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:00 AM","abortion-debates","662"

Try as they might, the profetallifers who post here cannot get around that singular issue. In their Ivory Tower musings, they cannot seem to fathom the danger to the society if we grant to the nanny state the power to intrude on this simple fact. They can pontificate and bloviate all they want, but not a single one has been able to come up with a method of banning abortion that is necessary, desirable, and practical without invoking the heavy hand of the state.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:34 AM","abortion-debates","663"
"12-18-2008","11293",45,"None","None","None","Shooterandproud","337139","Valuing flesh over mind is quite shallow. With the anti-abortionist logic, if we took a human brain and put it into a fully functional robot, that robot would not be a person, even though a human is controlling it. They also would claim that a permanently brain dead person has rights, moreso than the human robot. A fetus has no mental existence, what don't you get about that? There is no ""person"" or ""being"" inside of the fetus controlling it, like there is you and me. It sickens me to see that people would value a fetus over a woman.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:50 AM","abortion-debates","665"
"12-18-2008","11293",45,"Phyllis","337129","Because when abortion was regulated by the states for nearly one hundred years, society just crumbled underneath the weight of such tyranny, right? Get a clue chester. You have no basis for your opinion on this matter. And all the historical evidence would countenance that you are simply wrong. So what do you choose to do in the face of the overwhelming historical evidence? You choose to ignore the evidence in order to continue spouting your ignorant opinion.","chester","337140","My, how the worm has turned. At last, the tone of your response shows that you are simply one more angry rightie. Remarkable how you kept it hidden for so long. May I remind you that, when abortion was regulated by the states, there were few if any angry profetallife screamers. Women simply crossed statelines for their procedures and no one was the wiser.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:53 AM","abortion-debates","666"

(posted above) Then, tell me which of the Ten Commandments are not good for our society as a whole? Are you one of the anarchists who want to destroy all that is good? Societies which stray and have strayed from the principles of the Ten Commandments have suffered greatly. Are you an anarchist? The Taliban has nothing in common with the great success of the US...stop using that pathetic, desperate comparison. It shows such ignorance on your part.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:28 PM","abortion-debates","669"

After conception there is an entirely individual body which intrinsically has a right to its own life; it lives safely in its own womb until it is raped and violated and torn apart.

The best way to start with ending the practice of killing human life in the womb is to tell the truth. In addition, it has been found that the majority of the ""self-aborters"" were mentally ill and had suffered many instances of ""self mutilation."" Furthermore, our society was not encouraged to participate so freely in casual sex which leads to numerous mental and physical problems. Margaret Sanger made it possible for our society to lower itself to such base destructive behavior instead of promoting health and wellness.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:39 PM","abortion-debates","671"

I am sure that you have not realized it, but you have been misled considering the first amendment to the US Constitution and the reasoning from which it came into existence. Perhaps you did not know that all of the signers of the Declaration of Independence were Christians. They were members of different churches, and so the idea was to avoid favoring one church over the other....and make it a state church. Also, it is important to note that all of our founding fathers had ""faith,"" and faith in God is not prohibited in political nor public life, but is rather desired. More importantly for one to realize is that Atheism and Humanism are religions. When you take God out of political and public life you are thus promoting a religion....and that is violating our Constitution. Belief in God is not a religion, it is a relationship with our Creator. All throughout American history from the New England Primer used to teach the alphabet to children in school to the prayer of every Supreme Court Justice, belief in God is and has been very important to America. Forsaking God will lead to much trial and pain in America if all knowledge of him is removed from the public square.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:14 PM","abortion-debates","675"
