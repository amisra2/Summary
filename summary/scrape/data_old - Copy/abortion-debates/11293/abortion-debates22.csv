He carries this mental image of his own reality and attempts to force us to accept it as truth. Here's some true evidence for those who have believed the propaganda that abortion consists of removing cells from a woman. These photos come with a warning that they are explicit and disturbing. DON'T VIEW THEM IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO BLOOD AND DEATH! This photo represents the brutality and trauma that takes place in removing a 9 week old fetus. And this is an early abortion as the average is 12 to 16 weeks. http://anti-abortion.info/images/abo...week_fetus.jpg self explanitory ABORTIONPHOTOS This one is the most disturbing as the baby appears to be full term. If you're wondering why it is still in that position, it's because the abortionist must wait for it to die before removing it as it is fighting for its life as we all would. Remember, this was a perfectly healthy baby and it still has a healthy flesh tone to its color. http://www.phreak.org/archives/archi...fs/schock1.gif","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:08 PM","abortion-debates","316"

And why would you go out of your way to post a fetus which has no chance of surving rather than a healthy example? Are you completely incapable of seeing how dishonest that is? Beside that, are you also suggesting that your example is nothing more than a clump of cells as ingus suggested? Especially since he didn't place an age to his statement. Here's a photo of a normally developing fetus. Notice the fingers and toes? That is far from a clump of sells.

According to your link: The fingers are longer with the tips slightly enlarged where touch pads are developing. The feet are approaching the midline of the body, and may even be long enough to meet in front of the torso. The head is now straighter as the neck is more developed. Eyelids are almost covering the eyes, which up until this time have been uncovered. As early as this week the baby may move it's body, and may even be seen on an ultrasound. All vital organs are in place but aren't up and running like ours are.

Quote: Originally Posted by Joel_Henderson Biologically speaking, the fetus is human","Joel_Henderson","332771","(Note the key word ""also,"" which admits that it's human). As for the rest, This is more of the sort of ""defensive rationalization"" I talked about earlier, i.e. when people find it more rewarding to self-righteously defend their wrongdoings and thus shirk their responsibility to others, than to shoulder the burdens to those they have harmed, and thus they act in self-absorbed narcissism and sociopathic dissociation, while likewise waxing arrogant in self-deceiving affirmation of their own ""brilliance"" and other superiority to do as they please, by simply denying said consequences however obvious-- illustrated here, by simply calling a fetus a ""parasite"" and thus daintily strutting off away from one's obvious duties to it, despite admitting it's also human. However, a human being forced into dependency on another for its life, is not a ""parasite,"" but a VICTIM, and thus has the right to aid from the ones responsible for that dependency. Since you've admitted that it's human, then the remainder is plain; it also has the right to aid from the one responsible for its dependency, i.e. the man and woman in question who proximately caused it to be in its dependent situation through their willful actions in full knowledge of that risk. Here, the doctrine of Strict Liability would apply, in that normal sexual contact carries the inherent risk of pregnancy. This doctrine already applies to men, and should likewise apply to women who choose to abort in spite of their responsibility to the prenatal human in question, created and made dependent on her for its life through her intentional actions.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:12 PM","abortion-debates","327"

What theory of law would you use to support your point?","Joel_Henderson","332777","Yes, it seems you never learn, so I have no hope of educating you, and absolutely no intention. Since you ask nicely, the answer is ""Supreme soveriegn authority"", i.e. the fact that governments are established among men to secure their basic rights-- i.e. they not left to individual whims to respect or violate as each pleases, in the model of classic anarchy. States are thus delegated by their People, with the power to to protect these rights through laws . I believe we've gone over this before; you didn't understand it then, I doubt you will now... or ever. It's still true, however: ignorance is never disproof. If you form your own nation, you can name yourself the sovereign and construe the laws however you choose; however that's neither here nor there.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:31 PM","abortion-debates","329"

Big deal The only 'duty' that any human being has with a parasite is to extract it as quickly as they can, if they chose to do so. It's not a human being it's a clump of uninvited cells.
