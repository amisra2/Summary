The choice is theirs, and woe betide any of you profetallifers who would dare take it from them.","hollyh","337226","Your preaching to people who would force their own mothers to carry a child out of rape even with the knowledge it will cause lifelong devastation. However the pro life organisation are falling into bare existence, my generation, and your granddaughters generation are not being made redundant to such human rights theories. The measly pro-life rallies in Australia organised for protest of our new extended abortion amendments were demonstration of this. They even had campaigns encouraging members to bring on just one more person to double numbers simply in an attempt to gain a smidge of acknowledgment. Interestingly enough i would have far more interest in religion should it not be hindered by such veiws.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:00 PM","abortion-debates","692"

To further complicate things, I understand she was a devout Catholic. I was told by my adopted mother that a group of nuns took her in when her family kicked her out, and sheltered her until I was born, and I was immediately taken away and given to my adopted parents. Within the bounds of legality at that point, and within the bounds of her own personal morality, I believe my birth mother was cared for and protected as best she could be. I have to admit that when I think of her now, and as a mother empathise with the agonizing position she would be in (my daughter will be fertile very soon), I ache for her pain. It bothers me on a very real level to be a living emblem of one mans brutality visited on a child. And yes, it bothers me enough that if she had aborted me (and I had any consideration or thought regarding it at all) I would not have blamed her in the slightest bit. I dont have a right to exist compared to her right to finish out her childhood safe and unharmed. Its really that simple. Here is the complete link, its a bit of a read though Pandagon :: Feminists for Life: Objectively pro-rape :: October :: 2006 So nononsense, do you disagree and believe your mother should have not been given a choice and forced to have you? Note that your answer would seriously devalue the actual choice she made.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:47 PM","abortion-debates","693"
"12-19-2008","11293",47,"nononsense","337195","Now, are you going to continue to have tantrums? I am sure that you have not realized it, but you have been misled considering the first amendment to the US Constitution and the reasoning from which it came into existence. Perhaps you did not know that all of the signers of the Declaration of Independence were Christians. They were members of different churches, and so the idea was to avoid favoring one church over the other....and make it a state church. Also, it is important to note that all of our founding fathers had ""faith,"" and faith in God is not prohibited in political nor public life, but is rather desired. Belief in God is not a religion, it is a relationship with our Creator. All throughout American history from the New England Primer used to teach the alphabet to children in school to the prayer of every Supreme Court Justice, belief in God is and has been very important to America. Forsaking God will lead to much trial and pain in America if all knowledge of him is removed from the public square.","Shooterandproud","337229","So what if the people who signed the DOI were Christian? That doesn't say anything. Making a statement like that is like claiming that racial discrimination is OK in America because the DOI signers were white. More importantly for one to realize is that Atheism and Humanism are religions. When you take God out of political and public life you are thus promoting a religion....and that is violating our Constitution. Yes, Christianity is so great, isn't it? I mean, where would we be without the which trials? Imagine what an awful world we would be living in if Galileo's dangerous ideas weren't silenced! Christianity is a religion, plain and simple. You can call it whatever you want, but an personal unsupported opinion on how the world works is a religion and should be taken politically with a grain of sand. I believe the Taliban had a similar theory.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:23 AM","abortion-debates","694"
"12-19-2008","11293",47,"nononsense","337220","Everyone has an identity, everyone possesses traits of individuality. Everyone conceived is different and individual from everyone else conceived. You were conceived and eventually you will die.","antonia","337232","Eventually, ""I"" as an entity began to conceive -- that is, ""I"" came into being. Though whether I was conceived -- as in act of intelligence by another -- is a question of faith. There was a fertilized egg -- that's all we can agree upon. And there is an awful lot of ""coding"", if you will, in a fertilized egg. But ""coding"" is not a person at a later date. I can write a play. Put it down on paper. Without the actors playing their parts, however, it's just on paper. Yes, sooner or later, I will die. Cease to exist -- just as I did not exist at an earlier state in time.

"12-19-2008","11293",47,"antonia","337225","The quote was ""those whose traditions are different"". Not all religious faiths see pregnancy in the same way as you, and some people are not religious at all.","nononsense","337234","In matters of truth, opinions don't matter. I don't know of a civilized society which does not abhor the violence of murder. Taking the life of another goes against the grain of humanity itself. I did not bring up the subject of traditions. A tradition is something handed down through cultures and family, usually verbally. It however, cannot be verified. Again, taking the life of another human being goes against the grain of humanity. Abortionists and population controllers hand out their propaganda, but they will fail as all lies and liars eventually fail.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:03 AM","abortion-debates","697"

Arn't you glad she not only chose to have you, but she chose to see the fortune of your existence. Its lovely to no that she was given a choice. You didnt answer my question though, which is as suspected. So i will keep asking it. Would you deny your mother her right to chose if she did not want to continue any pregnancy as a result of the violent rape. Would you have forced her to continue the pregnancy?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:16 AM","abortion-debates","699"

Needless to say he was successfully prosecuted and ordered to pay damages. A doctor is bound by the ethics of his profession whilst treating patients, not by his/her own religious beliefs. Amen to that!","Winston Smith","337238","A doctor is bound by her conscience not to perform an abortion if her conscience prohibits it.
