I don't understand why you are not getting this point. You do realize that in civilizations, people are not completely free to do anything they want but that their actions are limited in circumstances that are decided by their government. In a Democracy, the people have a say in the limitations imposed on them in how they vote for politicians. It is then these politicians, limited by the constraints of the Constitution, and advised by appropriate experts, that come up with the details of the constraints (i.e. laws). This is such a basic point that I am continuing to repeat that it surprises me that you do not understand it. Laws are made by politicians and their imposition in particular cases is controlled by the justice department. Where abortions are concerned, if there was a third trimester abortion done by a doctor (under this third trimester abortion restriction scenario) for reasons other than reasons that are accepted by popular vote through the political process (ex. risk to mother's life, health, etc.), then the doctor should get punished, as well as the woman (depending on her circumstances). It is the general way in which all laws work. What is it that you don't get?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:28 AM","abortion-debates","262"

How to determine the difference between valid and ""Whimsical"" reasons why a woman chooses a late-term abortion? 2.

I get the impression that you expect the level of detail that a politician would present in a complete packaged bill that would be presented to Congress. If that is the case, then it is very unrealistic since that is not the purpose of these forums. We are not presenting packaged bill proposals but debating general concepts. Heck, even many bills presented to Congress do not include specifics about the types of punishments imposed. Either way, if we cannot agree on the most general directions for abortion rights, it makes no sense to start ironing out all the details. Currently, the abortion debate ranges the gamut from no abortions ever to abortions allowed always. One has to address step one (when or if to ever limit abortion rights) before one goes to step two (how to enforce that limit). You are putting the cart before the horse. That includes specific penalties. As for the reasons that are considered valid or unvalid, that is why I brought up the idea of exceptions many posts ago. In my view, these would include the ones that are often sited in these forums - risk to mother's life, significant risk to her health, risk of significantly deformed fetus, rape, incest, etc. If someone comes up with another exception worth considering, then they are free to present it here for debate. The health exception would also have to be debated in more detail since those on the pro-life side do have a point that automatically assuming that ANYTHING can be claimed as a health exception is also unreasonable. I tried to start a thread here on that once but it didn't get very far. Either way, nothing we say here matters much anyway except in how it affects our decision-making when it comes to electing our politicians, or in how we respond to polls about abortion rights. Again, it is the politicians we elect who decide. We could only give them input through polls, letters to our Congressmen, etc. about what type of laws we would support. As a last point, I really don't see the reason why you are pushing so hard for us to iron out details of the punishments this early in the debate (again putting the cart before the horse).

You are asking for detailed specifics before this forum has even come anywhere close to a consensus about whether or when abortion rights should be restricted. Again, we are not politicians here presenting bills but voters debating general topics. This is something that you just don't seam to get. Since you are the first person I have seen who expect this, on any forum over at least five years of my participation in forums, it seems that your expectations are not shared by anyone else but yourself. Yes, theoretically, I could sit down, start taking time to review the procedures that they have in UK and the rest of Europe, try to figure out what if any parts of that could be adapted to the US. Also, it would require me to sit down and look at the specifics in how laws are translated into legal punishments here, the flexibility or lack thereof of justices in determining particular sentences, etc. If a third trimester restriction would someday be implemented then that would eventually be necessary but not by me (where I am far from an expert) but by the politicians and legal experts who have the time and expertise and power to implement such policy. My going through such efforts would be a complete waste of time since I have no power to implement such changes and since it adds nothing to the general point that is being debated about whether or when to restrict abortion rights. As I said before, you are putting the cart before the horse and have unrealistic and waste-of-time expectations that nobody else I have ever encountered on forum participation over five years has ever expected. Therefore, I feel no responsibility to come up with details that are not more than initial guesses or gut reactions. If you think that such expectations are reasonable, then show me a quote of someone in this forum who outlined the type of details you suggest - on any topic, not just abortion. Then, I will see that it is not purely loopiness on your side but that at least one other person conceded to such unrealistic expectations.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:28 AM","abortion-debates","401"

Unless and until you do, I would suggest that it is difficult to take what you put forth seriously. Ideas have consequences, and you need to consider them prior to staking out a POV. I realize that sounds condescending, but that is not my intent. The implication of the thought that each woman needs to have the right to make the choice for herself with the law remaining silent is simple; it is the autonomy of women.

The imposition of punishments is a second and independent step to the idea that something should be legal or illegal. The only reason not to debate the first step on its own (i.e. whether or when to impose limits) is if no execution of such a law would be possible. That is not the case. You still have not made the point of why one would need to go into the details of punishment before one makes a consensus of what it would be that one would be punishing for. As for the two examples you brought up of people's proposed punishments, those are the type of gut reactions that you would expect from people that I was hesitant in giving since gut reactions are rarely well thought out. For example, a $5k fine for a doctor is negligible compared to what he makes in a year and will hardly serve as a deterent, as will $2.5k for a woman of reasonable means, while $2.5k might be utterly unaffordable for someone who is barely surviving from paycheck to paycheck or living on welfare. The life sentences imposed on a woman with a family would cause much more harm than good. I already mentioned my gut reaction solution in an earlier post ""Either jail time (say, a year or two), a large fine (withdrawn from the first years of their working life, not paid by their parents), or large amount of community service, depending on their circumstances (ex. less penalty for first offenders, for those who are younger, etc.)"". At least I had the honesty to say that these are initial thoughts and that, since I am not an expert, full decisions on punishment would have to be taken up by those that are. The only general statement I will make is that any punishment should be harsh enough to serve as a deterent, but not so harsh as to stop the person from continuing some level of normal life (though not necessarily as good as if it were blemish-free), and which should take into account extenuating circumstances - ex. family to support, first time offender, age of offender, mental state, etc. So, you have not given examples of people who have given full thought to the type of details you asked for but of people who have given you gut reactions out of pressure. Fine, I already gave you the same gut reactions. If you want more detail than that, then show me an example of someone who gave you more detail.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:04 PM","abortion-debates","502"
"01-15-2009",2,"11293","969","Another opinion","340328","One more thing to note: In a Democracy such as ours, if the majority is large enough, then the whole Constitution could be rewritten via a new Constitutional Convention. Given current politics, that is extremely unlikely, but the calling of a new Constitution is built into our political system as an option. The bottom line is that a large enough majority can decide on pretty much whatever law they want anyway so we should focus on current US and world politics, not on where a future majority might lead us.","chester","340331","Maybe YOU can choose to ignore the possibility you raise, but I would hope that, upon reflection, you are as frightened by the possibility you raise as I.

My position was, is, and always will be that it is the proper role of each and every pregnant woman to decide what value she gives to her fetus. If any particular woman believes that her fetus is a separate entity and she chooses to protect it with all the resources at her command, I support that. If another pregnant woman chooses to think of her fetus as disposable and acts on that belief, I support that as well. That's the true essence of the pro-choice position - the empowerment of women and the recognition that each and every pregnant woman is capable of making competent choices.","gansao","338490","One mans opinion..good for him.
