According to the scientists this behaviour is a product of evolution for males dont want to care and raise children that are not their own. Why the female of the species cheat?

You, sirrah, are obsessed and you ought to do something about it. You could begin by considering the real fact that men cheat.

"","12-16-2008","11293","simone","336884","Why men cheat. They are visually stimulated and they have a roving eye. Most men, however, are civilized and don't choose to act on these impulses because they respect the women they are committed to. However, in some cultures, men are not encouraged to respect women. These men are carefully taught that it's OK to lie to women, to deceive women because, after all, women are little more than children and don't need to know the truth. Some men are also ""grabbers."" They feel that they are entitled to everything in the world -- after all, that's what their culture taught them. If not gods, they are next to the gods and women are less than human. A woman is something to masturbate with. That's how much emotional investment these sorts of men have in women. These men are also prone to be rapists.","Winston Smith","336887","a woman is something to masturbate with??? imagine if I had said that for some women a man is something to masturbate with? the sisterhood would have been up in arms calling me a sexist pig. By the way as Woody Allen said about masturbation: ""what is wrong with making love to the person you love best?"" I am not obsessed with cheating women, I am not obsessed with abortion. I was just using these topics as something to talk about. I could switch sides and support abortion for this is just a forum not a court of law. What is my personal position on abortion? That is for me to know and for you to guess. What I have been obsessed with, day and night for most of my life, is cruelty to animals, I am also obsessed with the destruction of our habitat and of the rest of the animal kingdom. What this forum needs is some light bantering, some humour, unfortunately zealots lack this trait. It is summer in our glorious city by the most beautiful harbour in the whole universe and I wish I could sail in it everyday. Alas, not yet. You sisters take yourselves and your concerns so seriously, too seriously for my taste. So, it is back to literature, art and movies (also art) for me. I am watching ""Paths of Glory"" this evening.

Despite the hypocritical claims of the Roman Catholic Church for ""sanctity"" of life, a great number of Roman Catholics freely participated in the atrocities at Passau and were never disallowed Catholic rites and burial. The sanctimonious claims of Roman Catholicism ring quite hollow after such events.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","abortion-debates","1008","12:12 PM"
