If anything, your posts and reasoning are radically pro-choice.","chester","337604","That's exactly the point. In my opinion, each and every woman has the right to choose for herself whether or not to continue her pregnancy. No man - not I, not the parish priest, not the sperm donor, NO MAN- is entitled to have an opinion on the topic of her or any other woman's pregnancy. Now, let's see just what sort of a plan the pontificators and bloviators can create to enforce the law when and if the topic of abortion is returned to the states. they are the ones proposing the change; the burden is on them to prove their change is necessary, desirable, and practical. If they fail any of these three prongs, they lose.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:58 PM","abortion-debates","796"
"12-21-2008","11293",54,"hollyh","337552","I second this! As always, you avoid answering most questions, not exactly conducive to good debating skills. You post unrelated/unsolicited religious scripture in attempts to deflect from actually providing evidence of your fickle claims. You still, even with prompting and instruction refuse to post arguments with credible, fully sourced evidential backing. You avoid or ignore any challenge put forth of your opinion instead choosing to waffle on with entirely random points of contention. The basis of your defense, if you ever actually reply to a direct question relies on the opposition being ""forced"", ""lied to"" or ""ignorant"". This is the definition of intellectually bankrupt my dear. I tire from the expenditure without reward so I'm just going to move on. I will however in closing, follow your request and research Simon Greenleaf. Merry Christmas.","nononsense","337607"," He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

And turned out to be something other than he has represented over time. In which case, he would be politically finished. And NARAL would have even more to answer for. This would have happened, however, if McCain/Palin had won the election. The legal landscape of America then changing radically, with abortion becoming increasing inaccessible in wide swaths of the nation. And even more inaccessible to the poor. But the United States has spoken resoundingly here. If anything, less power must be vested in the states on related questions, with certain laws being overturned as unconstitutional. And, poorer women must regain their right to choose -- as was chipped away by Jimmy Carter, for starters, who couldn't separate his personal beliefs about Jesus, from his responsibilities as a public official to the law of the land. (That is, the government should be paying for abortions just like any other medical procedure needed by those who can't afford it.) Not that there weren't other things I liked about the man. But I'd ask him how he feels about a woman aborting an embryo -- vs. a woman having to wait until the tail end of second trimester because she needs to save the money to pay for (in addition to medical) transportation, hotel, childcare, time off from minimum wage work -- in order to travel to a place that can do the procedure.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:16 PM","abortion-debates","798"

You have told me I support murder and execution, I'm ""pretty smart for a woman"", I'm being ""tiresome"" (another little sexist quip), you associated me with an image of a reactionary and reprehensible female politician, you offensively tell women ""to keep their legs closed"", making inappropriate references to their personal sex lives, and you have repeatedly attacked my intentions as dishonest, while not being able to logically respond to an argument. You also repeatedly insist that others respond to the points you raise, and refuse to respond to their points. Even after you say you will. Over and over again, you make these ignorant, sexist, insulting statements designed to dig into others, in a passive aggressive manner. There's more, and I don't have the time to go hunting back for all the garbage and gamey baloney you spew in between having a conversation about an issue. I feel sorry for you, Winston. But, enjoy Degas and have a happy holiday season, old man.

I dont have an axe to grind a conversation for me has to be light-hearted, and also serious, and humorous at times i.e. what you call gamey baloney.

It's wonderful if people adopt a child, and, if a woman chooses to follow a pregnancy to term, while responsibly arranging for an adoption, that's her decision. But, to my view, there's an edge of naziism to this notion of putting women in a position of handing over real children, they've given birth to. Sorry, but there's no comparison to aborting a blastocyst and handing over a human child. But you hear these protolifers blithely talk about how women could just give a child up for adoption. And put women in this kind of position of choosing.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:38 PM","abortion-debates","800"

Perhaps it's fruit of the tree of knowledge being offered you? I think you hide a lot of aggression and bad feelings towards women in your so-called ""humor"".

These terms sounds very denigrating and hateful to me. I think this is the essence of the term, ""niggardization"". It's like people trying to make someone into their reduced view of who they see that person as, because of their gender, race, whatever. Interestingly enough, a number of these protelifers are obsessed with this issue of ""personhood"". Yet their disturbance revolves around not seeing women as persons, like themselves. With the same kind of needs and boundaries in life. I would agree with that, in some cases. For example, someone taken up with the issue of monogamy might have had a mother or father, or both, in serial affairs. Sometimes they see the father putting down the mother as if it were the most normal thing in the world. There's a family of origin dynamic, though, that colors their view of the world. It does for all of us, and what we see, for us, appears normal. We take it for granted and often, don't automatically understand that there's another way to be.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:38 PM","abortion-debates","806"
"12-21-2008","11293",54,"chester","336892","OK. Let's assume for the sake of argument that your absurd POV prevails. What will your statute outlawing abortion look like? Who will be subject to its provisions? How will abortions be detected? What will the sanctions be? To whom will they be applied? What will the cost in dollars be to enforce your statute? I'm really getting tired of the same old sanctimonious bloviations about the origins of life and when personhood does or does not begin. Why won't you profetallifers ever climb down from your ivory towers and discuss the nuts and bolts of what happens when you prevail and the nanny state intrudes itself into the most personal decision a woman can ever make. Keep the government out altogether. OK. Let's assume for the sake of argument that your absurd POV prevails. What will your statute outlawing abortion look like?

Keep the government out altogether.","nononsense","337636","Who makes the laws? Congress. When Roe is overturned based on the fact that, first of all, it is unconstitutional, secondly, it contradicts itself and implies a pneumbra for women but not for children. Finally, Blackmun skirted around the truth of when human life begins, thus committing an egregious error in his opinion. Good people change bad laws, and we will overturn Roe v Wade. We never advocate a nanny state, but a state which protects not only some lives but all lives....after all, it is an inalienable right. We will do what we have been doing, but on a grander scale. We will fund only clinics which are effective in keeping young girls and women healthy. We will provide education on healthy living. We will provide services and help for those needing help with their babies. We will place babies in homes waiting to adopt. As for the law, it will operate like every other piece of legislation. Doctors are to do no harm, and will live up to that expectation. Anyone providing an illegal abortion will face legal action. You stupidly act like every law breaker in the world will be proscecuted, when you know that is never the case. As for abortions (legal) causing harm to a woman, that is still the case today. Planned Parenthood has been the cause of many damaged uteruses, caused many to become infertile, and has caused deaths due to their so-called ""safe abortions."" The more cases there are the more chance for damage and death. Women who abort may not always nor immediately suffer, but they will in time. It is ironic that abortion is sold as a way to relieve women from harmful conseqences and billed as something which never harms women, while it hurts every woman, child and family it touches. Physicians know and believe that life begins at conception. Many testified before congress.... In the words of Dr. Lejeune: ""Each of us has a very precise starting moment which is the time at which the whole necessary and sufficient genetic information is gathered inside one cell, the fertilized egg, and this is the moment of fertilization. There is not the slightest doubt about that and we know that this information is written on a kind of ribbon which we call the DNANature has used the smallest possible language to carry the information from father to children, from mother to children, from generation to generationAt no time is the human being a blob of protoplasm. As far as your nature is concerned, I see no difference between the early person that you were at conception and the late person which you are now. You were and are a human being."" This is an excerpt from a thouroughly researched and thought out argument against Roe. If any of you are interested in actual facts: Recall the 1857 Dred Scott v. Sanford decision, which declared that slavery could not be prohibited by Congress in any territory of the U.S. and that African Americans were not full persons and not afforded the same rights as ""full persons."" Sound familiar? President Lincoln argued that the slaves were persons, not possessions, and that their unalienable right to liberty was protected by the Declaration of Independence unborn. To add to the irony, after the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, came the Thirteenth (1865) and Fourteenth (1868) Amendments, all which overthrew slavery and the erroneous Dred Scott Supreme Court decision. The Fourteenth Amendment...how ironic. One of the Amendments which helped overturn Dred Scott is now used to further the ""non-person"" argument -the same argument the Amendment was created to prevent! How can the Supreme Court use the Fourteenth Amendment to help justify denying the unborn unalienable rights when this Amendment was supposed to protect people from such selective rights attribution?
