"01-19-2009","11293",68,"Another opinion","340795","So, my bottom line is that, if you hold your view strongly enough, have a strong foundation of rational support behind it, and it doesn't interfere with major rights granted us in the Constitution, then you have every right to think that your view should become law and play your part in supporting that view through your voting habits, civic activity and expressions in forums such as this. Nobody has the rational right to tell you otherwise. After all, in a Democracy, if the people (and you as part of ""the people"") do not have a right to shape the direction of the laws that are imposed on them (through the choices they make in their voting habits, etc.), then who does? Should we shirk all such responsibilities to the political elites?","chester","340801","If you truly believe this, why are you SO reluctant to give even the barest outline of the law you would propose to restrict abortions that push your own ICK! button. Long again on generalities; sadly wanting in specifics.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:22 AM","abortion-debates","1006"

Do you have any facts to back up that implication? Why is this common and boring lie so often bandied about? Late-term abortions are extremely rare and there must be pressing reasons for performing them. Facts, please!","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:07 PM","abortion-debates","1007"

Despite the hypocritical claims of the Roman Catholic Church for ""sanctity"" of life, a great number of Roman Catholics freely participated in the atrocities at Passau and were never disallowed Catholic rites and burial. The sanctimonious claims of Roman Catholicism ring quite hollow after such events.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:12 PM","abortion-debates","1008"

Long again on generalities; sadly wanting in specifics.","Another opinion","340824","I already gave the general outlines of the law in an earlier discussion. The only thing I left out, which I am assuming that you are harping on once again, is the details of punishment. As I have said to you already in an earlier discussion, it is not the responsibility of people in a Democracy to outline all the punishment details of the implementation of the law, just the general direction. Once again, you are putting the ""cart before the horse"" in expecting any significant details about punishments before the general direction of law is even agreed upon. Given that you are the first person in five years of my forum participation that expects such a thing, I can freely assume that you are alone in these expectations and that there are no hypothetical readers out there that would also expect that since, after all, there is no logical reason why the ""cart"" would have to be put before the ""horse"" in this case. Besides, I already gave the ""barest outline"" of the punishment scheme you had asked for as the ""gut reaction"" version of punishments (which is all that any other people gave you) - once again you have forgotten. Unless you can come up with some valid reasons why the details of punishment need to be ironed out before the rule itself is decided upon, I feel no need to pursue it. As to the rule itself, I will repeat it one more time in case you have forgotten (which is a high probability) - restrict abortion rights in third trimester to limited exceptions - including risk to mother's life, significant risk to her health, rape, incest, and major fetal deformity - open to the possibility that other exceptions might be brought up by anyone for debate.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:10 PM","abortion-debates","1009"

Haven't you heard that the punishment defines to rule? Too harsh and no sane jury will convict; too lenient and no one will obey it; too many exceptions and they swallow the rule. I guess this is just part of your inability to think through the consequences of your ideology.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:37 PM","abortion-debates","1010"

I understand the idea that too harsh a sentence may make people lose support for a law which is why I had agreed to give the general outline in the first place. No more detail than that is necessary since the general outline is enough to determine whether any opinions are swayed, and the details of particular sentences are determined by judges within general outlines anyway. I am perfectly happy with the legal system the way it currently is - in terms of judges (who know the details of the case) making the final determination of punishment for a particular guilty verdict, guided by general outlines that are determined by legislatures / criminal experts which, in turn, might be swayed by very general outlines from opinion polls. My role as a debater and a voter, not a politician or criminal law expert, would only be in how I would respond to any general questions on opinion polls about punishment, no more.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:58 PM","abortion-debates","1011"

Sorry, but you can't say, ""I support restrictions on late term abortions"" on the one hand and then hide and say, ""I am not a politician, so I can't specify a legal sanction."" on the other. Let's try this and see if you will try to be more specific. Let's suppose you were polled by your local neighborhood politician, i.e., one who has the power to write legislation for your opinion on what the punishment for violating the ban on late term abortions should be. What would you respond? The condition of the question is that you were asked for your opinion.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:17 PM","abortion-debates","1012"
"01-21-2009","11293",68,"Another opinion","341101","You are not going to get any more detailed answer from me and it is doubtful that anyone else will give you any more of a detailed answer since nobody has given you a highly detailed answer up to now on any subject, not just abortion. Any further expectations from you would simply be unreasonable dillusion on your part. Indeed, your repetition of this question over and over again is wasting this forum's time. Unless you can show ANYONE who EVER gave you the type of detail you expect, then I will leave it as dillusional expectations on your part and not respond to future posts on this particular subject.","chester","341104","Translation: I can't give you an answer, because I haven't thought out the terrible consequences to women and to society in general should the restictionist POV ever prevail.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","09:38 AM","abortion-debates","1014"

If anyone here is going to take the restrictionist position, they clearly want the government to intrude. If they want the government to intrude, they need to have carefully thought out the consequences of that intrusion, the consequences to the women involved, the consequences to the society, and the consequences to the government. However, owing the the fact that we now have a pragmatic and not ideological President, the chance of the profetallifers imposing their POV on the nation are fading into the background.

If YOU think there are such terrible consequences, then name them . My guess would be that the only things you would point to is the fringe and very unrealistic paranoid fears of, as in your earlier example, government someday forcing abortion.

If there is no sanction, I can tell the government to go away and not bother me again. Now, if the government is going to tell women what they can and cannot do vis a vis their fetuses, it also needs to tell them what the sanctions are for disobedience.
