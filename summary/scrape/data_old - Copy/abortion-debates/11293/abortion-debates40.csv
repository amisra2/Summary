"12-14-2008","11293",40,"Winston Smith","336568","not at all. I was just referring to what I read in a women's magazine that my wife left around. Don't tell me that some women don't cheat? I have nothing as I said against women. My daughter has a Master in Medical Science and soon she will begin studying for a Master in nursing. We go to art galleries together and she is much smarter than I. Would I say this if I hated women ?","simone","336613","Why the devil do you keep harping on about women who cheat then? You seem obsessed with the idea of women being unfaithful. Why?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","11:10 AM","abortion-debates","588"

They don't understand that others may live in another way altogether. If they get someone pregnant because they can't keep their pants zipped, and they don't believe in abortion, I hope they believe in paying child support. And coming clean to their family members.

Why?","Winston Smith","336652","Do I? a touchy subject for you, Antonia and mae, among others? Don't tell me that some women don't cheat? I was just referring to what I read in a women's magazine that my wife left around (written you would say by a woman obsesses with women cheating, and read by women obsessed with women cheating) I also read in a New Scientist magazine that scientists have found that men suspect women of cheating even when there is no reason for it and also that women are better at hiding it than men. According to the scientists this behaviour is a product of evolution for males dont want to care and raise children that are not their own. Why the female of the species cheat? The New Scientist didnt say, so for that you need that women magazine and you being women know it better than I. So why women cheat, Simone, Antonia ?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:29 PM","abortion-debates","592"

Btw, whether or not you hate women was a point of contention between you, Simone, and Chester. My point (in addition to something having nothing to do with you) was that your comment was sexist and misogynistic and likely a projection. Plus, just plain slobbery. Just because you can say something nice about your daughter doesn't mean you can't say something piggish at another time.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:12 PM","abortion-debates","594"

It seems some posters cannot help but bring up the topic of sex with women posters no matter what the discussion. Clearly they have a problem relating to women or they are getting a sick kick out of unsuspecting posters. LOL. Yes, I have often been curious what abortion foes do when they find themselves in the position of having an unwanted pregnancy themselves, either as the woman or the spouse/boyfriend. I suspect when abortion affects their lives, they sing a different tune.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:44 PM","abortion-debates","595"

The root cause of it may be the trauma of having an adulterous parent and and growing up with the idea that is the norm.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:49 PM","abortion-debates","596"

Your loveliness goes on and on, hand in hand with your insults. And I dont think my comment was sexist or misogynistic. By the way, two good friends of us are lesbians, one of them Susan is American and when Obama was elected we had a small celebration party at our place. They come to our place all the time, we exchange songs in our i-pods etc. If I were sexist and misogynist as you falsely accuse me, would I be friends with them.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:43 PM","abortion-debates","599"

Or sometimes they claim someone they exchanged a few words with in Facebook as a ""good friend"" of theirs.
