"01-08-2009","11293",64,"Another opinion","339473","But the essence of your position is that it is the choice that she has about what to do with her body (abort or not abort) that is the right in question. After all, even if all abortions were outlawed, she would still have the right to assign whatever value she chooses to place on the fetus (after all, there is no ""thought police""), but she would not have the right to act on those thoughts by getting an abortion. Nobody is disputing her rights to have any thoughts she wants about the fetus. Laws restrict people's actions, not their thoughts.","chester","339482","Again, not quite. She has the right to decide whether or not to continue her pregnancy based upon the value she places on the fetus. That involves thought + action, and that is why the law must needs remain silent.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:34 PM","abortion-debates","946"

For example, if she places a high value on the fetus but decides on an abortion anyway, the abortion would be allowed. Again, nobody is disputing her right to have whatever thoughts she wants. The only thing in dispute is whether or not she can abort anytime or whether there are some times when abortion would be limited, where the exceptions to those limits are independent of her thoughts but on the situation - ex. her life is in danger (independent of her thoughts), her health is significantly in danger (independent of her thoughts), the fetus is highly deformed (independent of her thoughts), she had experienced rape or incest leading to pregnancy (independent of her thoughts). The only situation in which her thoughts would have any influence on the exceptions proposed would be if they were so severe that her mental health would be severely jeopardised (ex. she was suicidal). Otherwise, her thoughts would play no influence on the proposed state imposed limitations in late term. If someone steals a car, they are not punished because they did not respect private property. They are punished for stealing the car. If they did not respect private property, railed against it, published pamphlets but never stole anything, they would not be punished. This and all other examples of laws show that it is actions that are restricted by law, not thoughts, so I don't see why you are bringing up freedom of thought when there is nobody disputing it.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:00 PM","abortion-debates","947"

Do you not see the inherent contradiction here? She may well place a high value on the fetus but place an even higher value on something else in her life. Why would you deny her the right to make her choice? True but completely irrelevant. The car is someone else's property; the fetus is a part of the woman. If she chooses to protect it at all costs, that is her right; if she chooses to consider it as nothing more or less valuable than a tumor or a hangnail, that is her right as well. The same law system which today may deny a woman the right to abort her fetus can someday be used to require her to abort it. There the law goes at its, and our, peril.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:57 PM","abortion-debates","948"
"01-08-2009","11293",64,"chester","None","Why would you deny her the right to make her choice?","Steeeeve","339532","Because no one is allowed to create a difference in value of another human life.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:11 PM","abortion-debates","949"
"01-08-2009","11293",64,"Another opinion","339535","This is a slippery slope argument based not on an extrapolation of a current arguement but on a completely imaginary invention of a new one. Specifically, the reasons I have given for limiting late term abortions is to protect the rights of a now mentally existing human which I believe deserves rights. There is nothing in that arguement that could ever be extrapolated to the state requiring abortions. Indeed, there is NO social trend in this society that leads to that direction.","chester","339550","YET!! If you have a crystal ball into the future, please let us know. If you give the state the power to make any law re. abortion, you give it the right to make all laws on the topic. Is that what you really want?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","08:12 PM","abortion-debates","951"

There is no reason to go there since almost nobody shares that paranoia with you, so I feel no need to refute it.

Care to look at China's one-child policy? If you allow a government the power to prohibit certain, or any abortions today, supposedly in the name of compassion for the fetus, you have to concede that, at some future time, that the government can require them, all in the name of some other soft, fuzzy goal. No, the simplest and best solution is to say, ""Government, here you may not go!""","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:14 PM","abortion-debates","954"

In any event, if someone wanted to argue that the death penalty should be outlawed because it acts like a devaluing of life than I'd say they could have a good argument.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:26 PM","abortion-debates","955"

Call it punishment, call it a devaluation of life, call it whatever you wish, the individual is dead, the death determined by a group of others. I find it interesting that many anti-choicers are pro DP.

"01-13-2009","11293",64,"gansao","339175","If a fetus is, as you believe, just a bag of skin then it would be absurd to curb an abortion . However if one believes that the fetus is a human in it's own right then an abortion would infantcide.","Shooterandproud","340030","I don't see where you're going with this.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:05 AM","abortion-debates","958"
"01-13-2009","11293",64,"Another opinion","339180","Shooterandproud and Gansao: Do either of you believe that the status or description of the fetus changes during pregnancy? Shooterandproud: Do you believe that the fetus is just a ""bag of skin"" even one day from birth? If so, then why do you exclude its mental function which is essentially that of a newborn? I would agree that, early on in gestation when most abortions are performed, you might be right but it seems a very incorrect description for late term fetuses.","Shooterandproud","340032","Yes. I'm not talking about late term feti. I'm against late term abortions.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","12:06 AM","abortion-debates","959"
