Every single choicer in this forum has argued for the right for a woman to choose to have an abortion. That means they are pro-abortion for those who choose it. If they thought abortion was a bad thing, then they wouldn't advocate for a woman to be entitled to have one. Very simple. Pro.","Another opinion","320913","If a person supported the right of the US to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki during WWII, does that mean they were ""pro-death by nuclear bomb""? If someone supports the government's rights to tax their citizens, does that mean they are ""pro-tax""? If one chooses the lesser of two evils, does that mean one is pro-that second lesser evil? No. Sometimes there are unfortunate necessities that one would prefer to avoid but that are better than the alternative - the lesser of two evils. Abortion is just such a thing. One would prefer to avoid having abortions, but sometimes the situation requires it. Pro-choice proponents simply view that, in the great majority of cases, the woman is in the best position to decide - especially since it is HER body that we are talking about. I don't know of any pro-choice proponents who go around saying ""Oh, what a great thing abortion is.."". Pro-choice proponents are certainly not driven by any love of abortion. They are driven by the fear of the alternative - that women with unwanted pregnancies are forced to carry those pregnancies against their will, leading to a wide range of problems both for her personally and for society in general. Similarly, though some on the pro-choice side might disagree, it seems that most pro-life proponents are not driven by glee at seeing women carrying a pregnancy against their will, they are largely driven by the repulsion and sympathy at seeing embryos and fetuses that they value aborted. If one doesn't even try to understand the opposition, then one will never get through to them. At least try to understand where the pro-choice side is coming from. Otherwise, your arguements will never hit home.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:40 PM","abortion-debates","196"

Simple as that. Your failure to understand this very simple concept is bizarre.","Another opinion","320961","You fail to understand the difference between someone supporting a RIGHT to an act, and someone being pro-the act itself. Do you understand the concept of choosing the lesser of two evils? It means that sometimes one chooses something bad because the alternative is worse. It does NOT mean that you are supportive of that lesser evil. Perhaps you are the type of person that things is fairly simple terms - good or bad - and fail to see that the world is not as simple as that. Many of our choices end up being the lesser of two evils. Abortion is one of those. Very few if any pro-choice proponents would view abortion as a positive thing. It is just that it is the lesser of two evils compared to forcing women to carry a pregnancy against their will. When you use the term that a group is ""pro"" something, it means that they value the thing and think that thing should be the norm since it is best. Again, you would be hard pressed to find any posts from pro-choice proponents that state that women SHOULD get abortions. I know this doesn't paint the world in as black and white a picture as you would like to see it. It is a distinction that is not obvious to someone who views the world as simply as you seem to.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:15 AM","abortion-debates","198"

In the case of ""the lesser of two evils"" (let's say a political election), you have several choices. You can choose not to vote at all, you can write-in a different candidate, or, you can choose the candidate you feel is ""less evil"". Now, if the latter is your choice, you have supported that candidate. I don't care if you don't like the candidate a lot, or whether you think there could have been a better candidate, the fact remains that you exercised your right to vote to SUPPORT that candidate which means you were PRO that candidate and ANTI the other. A fetus is either alive, or it isn't. Regardless of what stage of development, the fetus is not capable of exercising a will of its own. If the fetus dies in utero, the body in most cases expels it naturally. If a woman has to inconvenience herself for a few months because of carelessness or ignorance, too bad. Supporting a woman's ""right"" to choose to abort is the same as supporting abortion. You can play semantics all you want to attempt to modify your murderous position, but the result is the same.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","10:30 AM","abortion-debates","199"
"08-21-2008","11293",14,"Shooterandproud","320873","Biased survey, incorrectly referring to choicers as ""Pro-Abortion"". In addition to being biased, its wrong.","jyoshu","320979","Whether or not ""its"" wrong or not, the majority of women are indeed pro-life; the trend has been shifting toward respect for life for some time. http://www.washtimes.com/news/2003/j...-115636-9509r/","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:20 PM","abortion-debates","203"

"08-21-2008","11293",14,"None","None","None","iangb","320991","It seems to me that a lot of men are pro-life (would you object to being called 'anti-choice'? After all, that's just another way of spinning it...) because they don't then have to handle the responsibility of choosing between their child's life and their spouses. It seems to me that a lot of people are pro-life because they don't have to go through the harrowing responsibility of choosing between having an abortion and giving birth to a terminally deformed child, only for it to follow its predicted and predictable course and die within a year of birth. It seems to me that a lot of men are pro-life because they know they don't actually have to deal with the emotional and financial consequences of bringing a child into the world. Actually, I don't believe any of these, just as I don't believe your statement. In fact, I believe that most pro-choicers are pro-choice because of the essential word, choice . I recently supported a university referendum to allow racist and facist speakers in the main university building for much the same reason - that I may not like what they say, but I will support their right to say it (thanks, attributed-to-Voltaire). I'm no facist, but I'm pro-free-speech, just as I'm often anti-'abortions of conveniance' and yet pro-choice. I also believe that many people are pro-choice because they do not believe an abortion to be as important a date as you claim - instead, they believe that there is a very long causal chain from pre-intercourse to post-birth, and that breaking that chain before a foetus develops mental awareness (and even potential independance) is valid wherever that break may be - be it a close-to-deadline abortion, or using (effective) contaception. Removing potential for sentient life is very different to ending sentient life. And on some cases, ending sentient life is still the best thing to do - be it euthanasia for a child of self-defence for a pregnant woman.

We don't choose abortion over life, nor life or abortion. We are for the choice and freedom of the person who is actually in the situation rather than the government. So, calling any choicer pro-abortion is inaccurate, however calling any lifer anti-choice is accurate, because they are against choice.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:25 PM","abortion-debates","207"
"08-21-2008","11293",14,"Galactababe","320971","Another Opinion: What is so bad about the mother carrying the baby to term and giving it up for adoption? It's inconvenient? It brings shame to the family? She might have to take a couple of weeks off from work? I'm afraid I don't see bringing life into this world as a bad thing. Your lifeboat analogy is a poor one as well. If ""too many"" people managed to fit in the lifeboat, then they should all pray together to be rescued. No one should FORCE anyone else off the boat. That is the only BAD choice. No one on the boat has a crystal ball as to whether they will be rescued in an hour, a day or never. They made it to the boat, they should take their chances together. A rock? You are comparing a developing baby with a rock? Are rocks ALIVE??? No, I didn't think so.","Shooterandproud","320995","We are already overpopulated. Have you any idea how much trash and pollution one person brings into the world? Not to mention 1.4 million more? The last thing we need is more people. Fine. Here's one for ya. Its wartime and you're in a foreign country. You and abot 7 neighbors are hiding in your own basement. If the enemy soldiers hears you outside, then they will kill all of you. You found a baby and rescued it awhile ago, and brought it into the basement (the baby is not yours). All of a sudden, the baby starts crying and you cannot shut it up. Smother it with a pillow and save everyone, or allow it to cry, and possibly get everyone killed. What would you choose? And this is a metaphor, so don't try to wiggle your way out using scientific improbabilities, because the scenario is not meant to be perfect. A blade of grass would be more accurate.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:42 PM","abortion-debates","208"
