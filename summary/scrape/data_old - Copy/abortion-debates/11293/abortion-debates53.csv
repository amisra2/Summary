Why don't you just suggest that we don't intervene in the natural course of a disease? Why use medicine for anything? Why think or invent? Why drive cars? Use washing machines? Communicate on the internet? This is all so unnatural. Why are you so intent on diminishing the reasons women have abortions or determine they are not in a position to bring a child into the world? Or, should I say, why are you so out of touch? Don't you think women need to make a living? Uh -- let's say dad is deceased, missing in action, in jail, absent in some respect. Ok? This is the real world, Winston. So who is going to take care of the colicky newborn after the coffee break is over? Or is life only important to you when it's something imaginary, like this sci fi movie, ""The Unborn"". When it's real people, actually born, why bother, at that point? Reality is much too troublesome.","Winston Smith","337541","I knew you would say that everything is natural. By the way if everything is natural (according to you) why bother to mention it. By natural I mean without human intervention, as in a natural death or natural birth as in not produced or changed artificially ( by human intervention). Dont try that semantic trick again, it doesnt work on me. natural - definition of natural by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia. I am not I do Here you go again. I never said that life was only important when it's imaginary. Show the post where I said that. Real life ? : ""let's say ..."" "" I just dropped a baby and headed for the fields ..."" are your jokes and hypothesis 'real life' for you? By the way if I had made that joke about dropping the baby and heading for the fields you would have accused me of trivialising child birth, right?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:11 AM","abortion-debates","781"

Please refer to my post below regarding evidential submissions.... ...Um, i know I'm only a brand new law student but posting random, un-sourced, non credible ramblings does not constitute 'proof'. And since you previously accuse planned parenthood of being vastly corrupt in regards to their counselling services you would need to provide evidence suitable of a vast nature. Eg; more than one case reference, possibly a dissertation citing mass evidence/case loads. Here is what wiki had to say on the matter of sourcing evidence, it may help you in future. In general, the most reliable sources are peer-reviewed journals and books published in university presses; university-level textbooks; magazines, journals, and books published by respected publishing houses; and mainstream newspapers. As a rule of thumb, the greater the degree of scrutiny involved in checking facts, analyzing legal issues, and scrutinizing the evidence and arguments of a particular work, the more reliable it is. Academic and peer-reviewed publications are highly valued and usually the most reliable sources in areas where they are available, such as history, medicine and science. Material from reliable non-academic sources may also be used in these areas, particularly if they are respected mainstream publications. The appropriateness of any source always depends on the context. Where there is disagreement between sources, their views should be clearly attributed in the text.

He began writing Testimony of the Evangelists essay as a skeptic of Christianity setting out to disprove the Bible. The Testimony of the Evangelists Examined by the Rules of Evidence Administered in Courts of Justice'' or simply The Testimony of the Evangelists is an 1846 Christian apologetic work by Simon Greenleaf, a principal founder of the Harvard Law School. His ""A Treatise on the Law of Evidence (15 vols., 1842-1853)"" forms the basis for his study of the gospels. Greenleaf came to the conclusion that the witnesses were reliable, and that the resurrection happened... ....Greenleaf begins his book by arguing for the need to suspend prejudices and to be open to conviction, ""to follow the truth wherever it may lead us"". Wikipedia/ Simon Greenleaf Christianity does not profess to convince the perverse and headstrong, to bring irresistible evidence to the daring and profane, to vanquish the proud scorner, and afford evidences from which the careless and perverse cannot possibly escape. This might go to destroy man's responsibility. All that Christianity professes, is to propose such evidences as may satisfy the meek, the tractable, the candid, the serious inquirer."" Simon Greenleaf/Testimony of the Evangelists It is quite informative. You would likely open up many conversations on the subject.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:07 AM","abortion-debates","785"
"12-21-2008","11293",53,"antonia","337544","Of course you don't. You just imply it. My point was that you do trivialize having a child. Should I call you Winston McCain? After all, he's a male candidate, and more importantly, both he and Palin are opposed to abortion. I was not a Palin supporter. Our political views are too different and I think she was unqualified for office. I voted for Hillary Clinton during the primaries and for Barack Obama in the general election. Interesting that you supported them, too, from Australia. Seeing as they are both advocates, in your eyes, of mass murder.","Winston Smith","337551","I don't I do not. as usual putting words in my mouth I only asked if your surname was Palin, for it happened that I was reading an article about her before entering the forum and you made that remark about chopping wood and shooting a deer, kind of a Alaskan frontier woman, nothing to with politics. I do not endorse invading another country under false pretexts and causing hundred of thousands of deaths. I dont support banning abortion although I am against it for abortions will continue to take place no matter what and under terrible conditions. Abortion was just one of many issues during the election. I also supported Hillary but it was just out of ignorance I was not aware of how intelligent and capable Obama was. He was always against the invasion of Iraq, whereas Hillary Clinton joined the victory parade before the war even started. Hillary Clinton is too Clintonesque, namely poll driven. I saw a documentary about the Germans and the Romans (first century AD) and how a German priestess told the German leaders not to attack the Romans but they did She survived, most of the men did not. I suppose she was a Germanic Cassandra","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:30 AM","abortion-debates","787"
"12-21-2008","11293",53,"Shooterandproud","337489","Nononesense , your debating tactics are despicable and deceptive. You take few isolated incidents of women who regretted having an abortion while conveniently ignoring the rest. You use deceptive language while arguing that women are somehow ""forced to kill their own children and have them ripped from their womb every day"". This is quite ironic coming from someone who would force a woman to carry a fetus inside of her for nine months to fulfill your own moral ideals. You use terms like ""forced"" when describing counseling given to women in need when making a difficult choice. You use the word ""children"" to describe fetuses, which not only shows your lack of respect for living human children, but your blatant disregard of scientific fact.","hollyh","337552","I second this! As always, you avoid answering most questions, not exactly conducive to good debating skills. You post unrelated/unsolicited religious scripture in attempts to deflect from actually providing evidence of your fickle claims. You still, even with prompting and instruction refuse to post arguments with credible, fully sourced evidential backing. You avoid or ignore any challenge put forth of your opinion instead choosing to waffle on with entirely random points of contention. The basis of your defense, if you ever actually reply to a direct question relies on the opposition being ""forced"", ""lied to"" or ""ignorant"". This is the definition of intellectually bankrupt my dear. I tire from the expenditure without reward so I'm just going to move on. I will however in closing, follow your request and research Simon Greenleaf. Merry Christmas. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Hi there Winston , would you say your mildly pro-choice then? you posted that whilst you dont support abortions you are against them being banned. This sounds like you could be on the fence perhaps? By not banning abortions thus introducing them as an option you essentially allow women a choice, you dont condone the option but you see the necessity in allowing it. Is that kind of what your saying?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:14 AM","abortion-debates","788"
"12-21-2008","11293",53,"antonia","337550","Winston, So what are you saying? You don't believe in putting people on life support systems in hospitals, either? There's no semantic trick. I am simply calling things by their right name. You should try it sometime. It will clear out your thinking. See you.","Winston Smith","337553","As usual you are putting words in my mouth (it is becoming tiresome) I pointed out to you that abortion was not a natural process as per the definition of the dictionary, I provided you with the link. Why? because you dishonestly tried to obliterate the distinction between natural (as pertaining to nature and not man's intervention) and artificial. I did not say that I was against all non-natural interventions. I have never said that I don't support putting people on life support in hospitals. where did I say that? It is dishonest of you to continue trying to put words in my mouth. No, I don't think I'll be 'seeing' you. I have better things to do than continue throwing out what you try to put in my mouth. We are thinking of going after Christmas to Canberra, to the National Gallery to see an exhibition of Degas. He was so good at depicting the human figure. I love his strong lines and that blacker than black black of his. My favourite Impresionist painting ? one by Monet of a little sailing boat riding a green wave. I saw it in a museum in Amsterdam a couple of years ago. I have never seen a more realistic sea, incredible! and the little boat appears about to sail out of its frame in a second or two. I bought a postcard reproduction of it and have it in front of me on a shelf. As I said before, a pity you didn't debate honestly and instead relentlessly tried to make me appear what I am not. Of course being what I am, I did not call you names or reciprocated; on the contrary, I took your words at face value and did not try to stereotype you or profile you or stick a label on you. I am sure you will find others to debate with, and hopefully, (for them) you won't continue using your underhanded debating tactics. Merry Xmas Chao, I mean: Adios","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:16 AM","abortion-debates","789"

Id rather deal with Aussies than Americans, for as you can see they are so obstreperous by nature or nurture, I am not sure. I prefer the understated Aussies. Went to Manly beach the other day, had lunch with my wife and daughter at a beach front restaurant. I love Sydney. Now, to answer your question: Well, if a woman is desperate enough to have an abortion I'd rather have it done by a Doctor in a hospital or clinic than by a butcher in a filthy room. There has always been women requiring an abortion and there always be. I don't hate women on the contrary, therefore I wish them no harm Look, I am not judging anyone it is between them and their conscience. Did you see that recent Romanian film about those two girls one of them needing an abortion and the other one, her friend helping her find an abortionist? It was a good movie, I can't remember the name. I just Googled it: Romanian abortion film wins top Cannes prize. 28/05/2007. ABC News Online A pity Antonia had to resort to underhanded tactics just in order not to admit she was wrong sometimes, it was uncalled for since she is intelligent (more than I) To me this is not about scoring points, not about winning the argument no matter what. To me an ideal forum is where we go about interchanging opinions, not proselytising. At least this is how I approach a thread and if others don't, well I simply stop interacting with them. I am old, I have no much time in me left to waste it in sterile argumentation. LOL Chao,","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:52 AM","abortion-debates","791"

Canberra is not Washington or Berlin or Paris for sure, but it beats Port Moresby hands down. The drive down south is always nice and easy and the National Gallery is not too bad, been there only once to see a Greek and Assyrian exhibition years and years ago and it was more crowded than hell but not half as much fun. On that subject : I do wish the Devil exists for I have to tell you, Heaven looks like Hell to me, all those boring nice God loving people will be there zzzzz. nononsense for sure will be waiting for you there.

No, all the interesting fun loving people are waiting for me in hell, of course I will find there some people I will rather avoid: Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld for instance, but c'mon it is supposed to be hell after all","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","07:05 AM","abortion-debates","792"
"12-21-2008","11293",53,"Winston Smith","337502","The crux of the matter when it comes to abortion, is that it is convenient for whatever reasons. The problem arises, the moral problem that is, that what you are terminating is a process that if left to its natural conclusion would have had as a result a newborn human being. Abortion is against the nature of women, to defend it is to defend the antithesis of motherhood.","chester","337559","This is not an issue on which a man is entitled to an opinion.
