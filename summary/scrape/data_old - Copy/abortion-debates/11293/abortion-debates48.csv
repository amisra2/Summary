Either way she won her case big time.","Winston Smith","337244","the point is he followed his conscience and that it what matters. the good thing is that at least in Illinois and the UK and Canada, they agree with Antonia that 'murder' is a personal opinion and if that opinion is based on moral grounds it is legal to act according to one's conscience. makes sense doesn't it?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:33 AM","abortion-debates","706"
"12-19-2008","11293",48,"hollyh","337239","We have already dispelled the theory of universal truth, since it remains an objective and subjective term it does in essence come down to a matter of opinion. Especially when factual evidence cannot be attributed. Truth is simply having enough people validate an opinion. Religion and its many denominations are examples of this. What one faith believes to be true another disagrees. Who is spreading truth and who is not? well thats merely a matter of opinion isn't it.","nononsense","337245","Take your humanism and go talk to other humanists. If there is no truth, then how can you argue any point? Perhaps you are wrong. Perhaps you are responsible for not just the pain and suffering of one woman but of many. How then shall you live?","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:34 AM","abortion-debates","707"

When you take God out of political and public life you are thus promoting a religion....and that is violating our Constitution. shooterandproud: I believe the Taliban had a similar theory. More importantly for one to realize is that Atheism and Humanism are religions.

I believe the Taliban had a similar theory.","nononsense","337248","The Taliban, once again, is nothing like Christianity: Jesus said to be careful of false prophets....no matter what fold they try to persuade: Introduction to the Taliban The Taliban is a group started by Pashtun (major ethnic group in Afghanistan) Afghani Islamic students, who were educated in Pakistan under a radical militant sect of Deobandism which was preached to people in refuge camps located in Pakistan. Deobandism is an Islamic movement started in British India with two of its main goals being to unify and reform Muslims in India, there being a small population of Muslims and an imposing threat of British culture that could corrupt many young Muslims. The Taliban took the teachings from this sect of Deobandism and fused them with their own beliefs from Afghanistan. This group began to take over Afghanistan in 1994. In 1996 they imposed a form of Islamic holy law, or Sharia, in controlled areas. Under Sharia all citizens are entitled to five rights: life, intellect, family, property and religion. The Taliban took these rights mainly from women by making it so that women could not be educated over the age of eight, could not work at all, could not reveal more than their eyes and palms and could not leave the house without a male relative. Other restrictions upon the general population were the banning of television, photography, movies, kite-flying and chess. Punishments of breaking these laws are harsh, for example, the public amputation of the hand if you steal, stoning to death if you commit adultery or imprisonment if your beard was not the required length. This same year Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, was taken and the year after the Taliban effectively controlled 2/3 of the country. The Talibans interpretation of Islam being greatly influenced from a Deoband education in Pakistan it is possible that other people have been and can be educated by these same people spreading their fundamentalist interpretation of Islam. The Taliban itself can spread its constrictive interpretation of Islam to other people through education. This is still a problem because the people learning these disjointed Islamic views can form Taliban-like groups and are likely to be recruited by terrorist organizations due to their educators close ties with these organizations. normlife.com","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:48 AM","abortion-debates","710"
"12-19-2008","11293",48,"None","None","None","hollyh","337249","Again nononsense refuses to answer the question multiply put forth. Do i have to keep reposting it? Would you force your mother to continue with a pregnancy conceived by a violent act of rape against her will? Because your stance on the pro life issue is telling us all that you would! Oh and I'm not responsible for any womens pain because i stand on the side of those who support any womans right to decide for herself what causes her pain and how to absolve it. You however would stand in judgment and would force someone like myself to continue a painfully devastating pregnancy caused through the violent invasion of rape. Who is causing pain here i wonder? One more thing, if your mother believed having a child born from such a vicious attack was the worst thing she could do then you, her own child would be the one standing there removing her choice to do otherwise. You would be causing her pain. You do not, and never should have the power to decide what kind of pain and suffering any women should go through. Only that woman alone should, and thank god in my lifetime they have the power, i have the power, not you!","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","02:50 AM","abortion-debates","711"

Would you want her to risk PID, sepsis or death? Would you want her to watch the nurse reassemble the arms, legs, torso and head of her dead baby in order to know that all the body parts have been removed? What are the ways abortions are performed? Do you know?","hollyh","337263","[QUOTE=nononsense;337255] Well thats a silly analogy isn't it, since when does pro choice force anything? you no quiet well Pro choice means just that, no forcefulness of action nor opinion simply choice. If she made a choice to do so i would respect it. Pro life however is for the removal of choice and the enforcement of pain against ones will. I'm fully aware of the many kinds of abortion, its not my choice to make if someone choses to have one. I force nothing apon no-one, you however do. You still havent answered my question ...","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:21 AM","abortion-debates","720"
