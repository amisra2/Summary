You think that taking life than giving life? You are so misled and furthermore, willfully ignorant if you do not seek the truth and defend it. Women, don't lay your bodies down on that cold table seek out those who have warm hearts. You deserve the best life has to offer not more rape and violence.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:23 AM","abortion-debates","649"

"12-18-2008","11293",44,"hollyh","337086","Excuse me?? if you're going to quote me perhaps have the decency to use my exact words. I NEVER said ""obviously the son of a rapist must grow to become a rapist"". I did however say i would fear the child would posses the same violent tendencies as the rapist. Weather or not this is an actual fact was not my inference, it was merely my emotional personal opinion on the matter. The matter at hand being myself faced with such a hanais situation. Everyone else on here recognised it as such. I did not claim that every child resulted from rape will become a rapist!!! Do not attempt to generalise and label my personal opinion on an isolated situation. Especially as an attempt to insult and incite another poster into thinking his ""product of rape"" conception is viewed by myself as a pre-disposition to being a rapist. His mother, as Archangel mentioned is a wonderful, courageous woman to have overcome the tragedy and seen the good, thus producing a much loved and wanted son. And that is all that matters!","Winston Smith","337097","hollyh on post-rape: This is one of those extreme situations i would definitely abort. I couldn't imagine anything more vile than reproducing something with the DNA of a sick, psychopath. Even with my views on the horrific procedure that is abortion, the former for me would be far far worse. I would not even consider adoption in this instance, I would spend the rest of my life wondering if that spawn would then follow any genetic pre-disposition for disgusting, violent acts such as the rape that caused its existence. If it did, it would be my fault. I would not take any risk with such an existence. It makes me sick even writing about it in this post. Sorry for my emotional perspective, the very idea of this situation shakes me to my very core. It is one of the extreme situations i refereed to though. hollyh your words speak against you I hope you know now that there is no genetic pre-disposition to commiting rape so if you ever are raped (God forbids!) you may not act rashly and kill the 'spawn' for that 'spawn' may grow into a wonderful son or daughter.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:30 AM","abortion-debates","652"
"12-18-2008","11293",44,"antonia","337093","Maybe PP should send in secret agents like they do!","nononsense","337098","Don't kid yourself. Planned Parenthood has written the book on propaganda and deceiving weak minds. Margaret Sanger said, ""the most serious evil of our time is that of having too many children."" It was population control she was after, it was not in helping women. Margaret Sanger hated housewives who stayed home to take care of her children. She surely would hate those who now see the benefit to themselves and their families by forsaking their careers to raise their children! Sanger, herself, was not keen on abortion back then, but if birth control fails...the kid must go! Abortion stops a beating heart. It plunders life and soul of everyone it touches.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","04:32 AM","abortion-debates","653"

Secondly, opinions don't matter in matters of truth. To murder is to commit suicide or forfeit ones life.

To be fair though, i would ensure ECP was administered asap to ensure no conception would even occur.

"12-18-2008","11293",44,"Winston Smith","337101","I thought US laws were based on the Constitution and referendums.","nononsense","337106",""".....On at least seven occasions, members of this Court have noted the foundational role of the Ten Commandments in the development of our legal system."" Then we go on to list specific cases and citations from the Supreme Court Justices....the ACLJ is developing a resource library this year, which will include a bound edition of the Ten Commandments brief with the law and famous quotes in it, as well as pictures of famous Ten Commandments monuments and murals in courthouses throughout the United States. President George Washington said, ""It is impossible to govern the world without God and the Bible. Of all dispositions and habits that lead to political prosperity, our religion and morality are indispensable supporters."" * In 1782, the U.S. Congress voted in favor of a resolution recommending and approving the Bible for use in the schools. * Henry Laurens, fourth president of the Continental Congress, stated, ""I had the honor of being one who framed the Constitution. In order effectually to accomplish these great constitutional ends, it is especially the duty of those who bear rule to promote and encourage respect for God and virtue."" Patrick Henry, first governor of my beloved Virginia and a member of the Continental Congress, stated, ""It cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great nation was founded, not by religionists, but by Christians; not on religions, but on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. For this very reason peoples of other faiths have been afforded asylum, prosperity, and freedom of worship here."" On Sunday Closing Laws: ""These two cases, along with McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 81 S. Ct. 1101, 6 L. Ed. 2d 393, and Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599, 81 S. Ct. 1144, 6 L. Ed. 2d 563, resulted in similar and complementary rulings that the Sunday closing laws were valid. The Supreme Court recognized the religious origins of the laws but determined that the present purpose of the laws was not religious and that the laws were not invalid because they worked an economic disadvantage to some religious sects."" Every one of the Ten Commandments has been used and argued in judicial litigation in the last 200 years and earlier. The Ten Commandments are sound moral principals. God never fails. However, there are groups dedicated to fighting all things related to Christianity, and they promote lies. Sadly our history is being revised. Today very few Americans know their own history. Again, sad.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:51 AM","abortion-debates","660"
