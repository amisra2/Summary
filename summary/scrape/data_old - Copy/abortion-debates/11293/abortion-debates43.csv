Most men, however, are civilized and don't choose to act on these impulses because they respect the women they are committed to. However, in some cultures, men are not encouraged to respect women. These men are carefully taught that it's OK to lie to women, to deceive women because, after all, women are little more than children and don't need to know the truth. Some men are also ""grabbers."" They feel that they are entitled to everything in the world -- after all, that's what their culture taught them. If not gods, they are next to the gods and women are less than human.

By the way as Woody Allen said about masturbation: ""what is wrong with making love to the person you love best?"" I am not obsessed with cheating women, I am not obsessed with abortion. I was just using these topics as something to talk about. I could switch sides and support abortion for this is just a forum not a court of law. What is my personal position on abortion? That is for me to know and for you to guess. What I have been obsessed with, day and night for most of my life, is cruelty to animals, I am also obsessed with the destruction of our habitat and of the rest of the animal kingdom. What this forum needs is some light bantering, some humour, unfortunately zealots lack this trait. It is summer in our glorious city by the most beautiful harbour in the whole universe and I wish I could sail in it everyday. Alas, not yet. You sisters take yourselves and your concerns so seriously, too seriously for my taste. So, it is back to literature, art and movies (also art) for me. I am watching ""Paths of Glory"" this evening. Chao, babes, don't cheat","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","05:30 AM","abortion-debates","632"

"12-16-2008","11293",43,"nononsense","336853","A fetus is a person is an individual human. Do not lie and deceive and use medical terms to describe humanity when it is designed solely to be misleading. A newborn is a neonate, but the public does not use that term when describing a new born child. An unborn child is a child which hasn't been born. A womb is a place of safety for the unborn child. Abortion is not avoiding birth. It is giving birth to a dead baby.","chester","336892","OK. Let's assume for the sake of argument that your absurd POV prevails. What will your statute outlawing abortion look like? Who will be subject to its provisions? How will abortions be detected? What will the sanctions be? To whom will they be applied? What will the cost in dollars be to enforce your statute? I'm really getting tired of the same old sanctimonious bloviations about the origins of life and when personhood does or does not begin. Why won't you profetallifers ever climb down from your ivory towers and discuss the nuts and bolts of what happens when you prevail and the nanny state intrudes itself into the most personal decision a woman can ever make. Keep the government out altogether.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","06:31 AM","abortion-debates","634"
"12-18-2008","11293",43,"antonia","336950","To some extent, murder is a matter of personal opinion, even when we have (what we can agree upon), is a person. For example, in the U.S., we have a death penalty -- which we don't consider murder -- and we recognize people may kill others in self-defense, or as a result of other acts whereupon we do not hold them as responsible for the death of another (i.e. voluntary or involuntary manslaughter -- not murder). Plus, we engage in wars whereupon millions kill millions. Not murder.","Winston Smith","337082","murder is a matter of personal opinion??","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","01:18 AM","abortion-debates","639"
"12-18-2008","11293",43,"nononsense","336875","If so-called abortions happen without first having given all of the information available about the unborn and all the options for distressed parents there is no such thing as this so-called ""choice."" It is tragic that so many people have been deceived and lied to. I am so sorry for your loss. I am glad that you are willing to fight for right. God bless you. I too, have a story. But I am on the other end. I am the product of a rape. I am a testimony to the intrinsic worth of each person created. My mother said, ""Well, I just thought I got the better end of the deal,"" ""I got YOU.""","Winston Smith","337083","""hollyh"" said in this thread that if she was raped she would abort the child for obviously the son of a rapist must grow to become a rapist. so are you a rapist? of course not.

Anyone who allows an abortion is either a rapist or has been raped. Rape in its true meaning is to plunder, or to take wrongfully. It literally means to seize or take by force. Furthermore, it is an outrageous assault. Every baby aborted has been violated, and outrageously assaulted. How many lives have been taken by the force of the cunning currette? It is a practice we must stop. Every mother who has been to Planned Parenthood for counseling on a surprise or crisis pregnancy is the victim of fraud and her baby has been taken away by force; which is rape. In my mother's case, when she refused to kill her own child, it was extraordinary because in today's world two rapes will make right. It is a lie. The Feminist for Life counselors counsel women pregnant as a result of sexual rape, and as these mothers receive counselling and support, they see the humanity of their children and are more at peace about giving them life. It is a wonderful thing to love instead of increase the violence. Abortion is plunder of the child's entire life and the woman's soul.","every-woman-has-right-survive-pregnancy","03:00 AM","abortion-debates","641"

I NEVER said ""obviously the son of a rapist must grow to become a rapist"". I did however say i would fear the child would posses the same violent tendencies as the rapist. Weather or not this is an actual fact was not my inference, it was merely my emotional personal opinion on the matter. The matter at hand being myself faced with such a hanais situation. Everyone else on here recognised it as such. I did not claim that every child resulted from rape will become a rapist!!! Do not attempt to generalise and label my personal opinion on an isolated situation. Especially as an attempt to insult and incite another poster into thinking his ""product of rape"" conception is viewed by myself as a pre-disposition to being a rapist. His mother, as Archangel mentioned is a wonderful, courageous woman to have overcome the tragedy and seen the good, thus producing a much loved and wanted son.
