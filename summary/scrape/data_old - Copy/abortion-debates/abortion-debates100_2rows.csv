None, that's what.","gansao","449594","Then why are they obliged too? And its not really rape is it? Transvaginal ultrasound is a imaging technique used to create a picture of the genital tract in women. The hand-held device that produces the ultrasound waves is inserted directly into the vagina, close to the pelvic structures, thus often producing a clearer and less distorted image than obtained through transabdominal ultrasound technology, where the probe is located externally on the skin of the abdomen. Purpose Transvaginal ultrasound can used to evaluate problems or abnormalities of the female genital tract. It may provide more accurate information than transabdominal ultrasound for women who are obese, for women who are being evaluated or treated for infertility, or for women who have difficulty keeping a full bladder.

Because in medical definitions, the definition is exactly what I said (methinks you don't have an argument here). It might not prove it to you, but to most rational and logially thinking people it would. And this here shows exactly what type of a person you are. Why don't you post as to the topic of the thread instead of trying to start arguments? It's really sickening. ON the subject of your starting arguments, I notice you selectively ignored my view that I posted. Couldn't come up with an argument ?","Steeeeve","246793","I don't doubt that brain-dead means dead but I do doubt that can therefore infer that life means ""brain alive""...even you don't believe this as it has to be more than just a brain substance. well, I thought Another Opinion covered my belief fairly well so why bother? There is always the option not to respond to me. Actually I didn't even read it (and doubt I ever will). Don't get all worked up over it.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","02:22 PM","abortion-debates",88

But then again, you aren't one for logic, especially when you bring this ridiculous ""quasianalogy"" into the discussion. What I am saying makes a hell of a lot more logical sense than your ""analogy. Mine actually has logic in it: If a person's mental existence ends (brain death - defined my the medical field) they are considered dead. It is logical that if mental existence begins (start of brain activity and consciousness) they are now alive. And again, I wouldn't expect you to understand logic if it hit you in the face.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","05:26 PM","abortion-debates",117

I'm going to take a stab here and say you are probably in the 8 or 9th grade (not that this is a bad thing) because anyone who has taken a day of a logic class would understand how your statement makes no sense.

I didn't have time to bother with a spellchecker, I was just typing what formed in my mind. My apoligies to have upset you oh high and mighty one. I've noticed that when you don't have an argument you begin to quibble over some minor misspellings, or some dictionary definition (which you seem to hold as your Bible). Hm, well, sorry, you're stabbing rather wildly, in fact, you ended up stabbing yourself. I happen to be a twenty-year-old in my sophomore year of college at Colorado School of Mines (engineering and science school in case you haven't heard of it). I won't bother to hazard a guess at your age, as guesses base on internet discussion are notoriously inaccurate (as you just proved).","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","01:08 PM","abortion-debates",151
