"03-27-2005","4337",10,"JPSartre12","None","Being pro-life has no relationship to being anti-woman. That's an absurd assertion. Being Pro-life is about advocating for the fetus, not against the Mom.","Steen","102071","But advocating for the embryo or fetus means advocating the restriction in the woman's Constitutional right to control her own body. It means demanding that the woman can be FORCED to give off her bodily resources against her will. As such, it is rather hard to be PL and not a mysogynist, unless your PL leanings go towards reducing the need for abortions rather than restricting the access to abortion. Yes, it is entirely possible to be prolife by seeking to encourage the woman to not about through support and better prevention. However, most PL don't go that route and instead go the misogynistic route of trying to take the woman's rights away. Using the stick instead of the carrot is what makes so many PL into misoginists. Note that if you instead focused on reducing the NEED for an abortion through better prevention and more support of pregnant women, then you would have instant support from the prochoice community. IF PL had put energy into that direction instead of the misogynistic one of controlling women, the number of abortions today would be much, much less. However, the PL generally have gone the other way, to ward moralistic/theocratic punitive enslavement of women instead. They chose to be misogynists instead of supportive of the woman. hence, it is REALLY hard for PC to believe that PL is not about using abortion as a means of subjugating women. So how can we NOT see you as misogynists? If you truly wanted to reduce the number of abortions, you could have long ago. Instead, you have chosen the attempt at restricting women, and years of legal battles have done little to reduce the numbers. If those funds from both sides had been sunk into sex-ed, better and more available contraception and support of women who ARE pregnant, how many abortions do you think would happen today? half? one third? one tenth?","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","06:44 PM","abortion-debates","141"

You claim to be for the embryo, yet do so solely through oppression of women. That slavery is immoral. And your claim that these are the reason why women seek abortions is just an exquisit example of how clueless you are. When abortions were illegal, women risked their lives to get them. To minimize this with STRETCH MARKS just shows how clueless you are, how little you care for the woman other than a charicature of a baby killer, and why you will never get anywere other than into yet another fight that preserves the status-quo. Yes, your misopgynistic description of the women who seek abortions is duly noted. You do truly see them as lesser beings and not individuals with their own rights.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","06:51 PM","abortion-debates","143"

That is why we can never get anywhere by focusing on what the fetus is or isn't, or on restricting the woman. The ONLY way to get anywhere is to look at what the common ground is for preventing the need for an abortion. Very few prolifers are interested in this, as it apparently is not punitive and subjugating enough for their taste.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","07:26 PM","abortion-debates","149"

To me, that discussion has absolutely nothing to do with abortion or personhood and everything to do with accurate descriptions of developmental stages.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","07:30 PM","abortion-debates","150"
