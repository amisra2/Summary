I simply provided information that refutes the assertation that gays are more apt to prey on children and provided a little history on my information and level of training around sexual violence. You, on the other hand, called me radical and made claims and did not back them up. Furthermore, you are perpetually insulting others. I, as a rule, think people should speak plainly, but you aren't going to get any sympathy out of me about being insulted when you perpetually call liberals names, call Duo ""little man"", and are willing to insult all homosexuals with the accusation that they are child-predators.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","05:09 PM","abortion-debates","202"

"04-25-2005","4337",14,"simone","None","In response to my statements, The refusal of the church to allow women to serve in the priesthood, and, The denial of leadership roles within the church to women, you say: Obviously, women are considered by the Roman Catholic Church to be unfit to be priests and to hold leadership roles within the church. Why else would women be so excluded from those roles?","maximus","112306","Simone, Women are not considered to be unfit to be priests. A woman cannot be a priest just like a man cannot be a nun. It's not about being unfit. It's about trying to fulfill a role that is contrary to one's nature. As Father Fessio explained Sunday on Meet the Press, the Church is spoken of in scripture as the bride of Christ and Christ is the bridgegroom. Priests succeed Christ and a woman cannot be a bridegroom and have a nuptial arrangement with a bride. It doesn't work. And women do hold many leadership positions in the Church.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","08:29 PM","abortion-debates","208"
"04-25-2005","4337",14,"simone","None","Ah, yes, Paul's text where he puts down exacly what the position of women are to be in relationship to men, subject to their leadership, Christlike, to be the head of the wife as Christ is head of the church, whether or not a man may be suitable for such a position. Paul decrees, we must all obey, right or wrong.","maximus","112309","Simone, I would guess that you, like the others who cite only the ""submit"" sentence of Ephesians 5 might not have ever read it in its entirety. Let me post it for you so that you can see for yourself that Paul does not say an unsuitable man may be privileged enough to gain the submission of his wife. Nor does he say that she must obey him right or wrong. Ephesians 5 21 Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. 22Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. 23For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. 24Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. 25Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her 26to make her holy, cleansing[1] her by the washing with water through the word, 27and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. 28In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies . He who loves his wife loves himself. 29After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church-- 30for we are members of his body. 31""For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.""[2] 32This is a profound mystery--but I am talking about Christ and the church. 33However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself , and the wife must respect her husband. Submit to one another ? What does that mean? You mean the wife isn't the only one to have to submit? How much did Christ love the Church? He died for it. So Paul tells men that they must love their wives enough to die for her . (There is no greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for one he loves). Paul then tells men to love their wives as their own bodies . So if a man is not acting Christlike --if he is acting in an abusive, immoral, wrong way then there is no obligation for his wife to submit to him. Out of time. More on your other post later. I do wonder why you now say you don't consider yourself morally superior though when in the previous post you declared yourself to be morally superior. I'll ask more later.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","08:36 PM","abortion-debates","209"
