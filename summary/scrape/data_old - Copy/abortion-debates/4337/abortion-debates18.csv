I was devastated and decided then and there that I would never trust anyone as I had trusted my parents, who told me there was a Santa but had lied to me. And what's most interesting is ... how did I know that my brother and his friend were telling me the truth? Turns out they were, but how could I have proved it especially at the age of 5? The truth of the matter was, I made a choice, I chose to believe my brother and his friend - they were very convincing. But ... they could have been wrong. about 2000 years ago a man asked a most profound question when he asked, ""what is truth?"" Now check this out, he did in fact ask the right question and he even asked the right person (of all people who had ever lived, the person he asked really knew the truthful, accurate answer). The only problem was that the man who asked the question didn't wait to hear the answer but rather, he jumped to his own conclusion and missed an opportunity to receive the truthful answer to his question. - Why is it when some folks hear a favorite song they may well say, ""wow, that's an inspired song!"" yet the same folks do not believe it possible that the Holy Bible (to be precise, the original manuscripts) were written under inspiration from God ? Perhaps they will say in reply to that question, ""Because there is no God."" - Why is it that so many say there is no proof of God when in truth there is an amazingly huge amount of proof that there is a Creator? "" From the time the world was created, people have seen the earth and sky and all that God made. They can clearly see his invisible qualitieshis eternal power and divine nature.

Romans 1:20 explained in it's simplest form : It says: on the day we stand before God Himself not one single person will be able to say to Him, "" I didn't know that You existed "" because God says He shows us He exists by showing us His creation - which are the stars, sun, moon, galaxies, our bodies, all creation.

But for the sake of simplicity let's take the term 'circular reasoning' completely out of our discussion as follows: As I look up at the night sky and see the multitude of stars, the moon, and during the day I see the sun, the clouds (if there are any) and then I observe things on the earth like trees and animals and bugs, and how about water - pretty neat stuff, isn't it?

Have you ever seen the space shuttle? Most of us have. Did you ever think that it just happened? Of coarse not. We give credit to it's designers and fabricators, etc that brought it into existance. We say, ""America has a space shuttle, wow, look what we built!"" We see design and then we give credit to the designers/builders. How much more so does this hold true for creation? There is such awesome design to creation. Isn't it interesting how people keep trying to clone life? Oh yes, if man ever manages to make a person, why, he might even think himself to be God! And heaven help the person who suggests that it 'just happened'! But you see, even if man does clone a human - they still had to start with something, like a living cell. Who made the cell? When a spem cell and an egg come together how is it that the cell divides into 2, then the two into four, 4 into 8, 8 into 16 .... it's called binary and it's the basic principle that allows a computer to work. Interesting how binary shows as part of the creation of a computer but binary cell division does not? We know full well that we design and build computers. And even if we don't want to admit it, we know full well that someone created creation. We don't need to read it in a book, even if that book is the Holy Bible.

I do believe in a god or higher power, but I do not believe that he came down, gave us a moral code, then damns us to hell if we don't follow it. That seems very stupid to me. It spells out blackmail and terror, and i thought God was supposed to be good and just. Such as? This is quite a statement. I spent 6 years in a catholic school, I looked for a God the hardest I could. I did believe in one for awhile, but then I found, when I was older, logic. I started questioning in depth the christian dogma. And after months and months of pondering this question, it became obvious that there was no ""Judge Judy"" type god. I found that the followers were blind. That may be a harsh word, but the fact of the matter is, they want to believe in a God. A higher power. It consoles them, it makes them feel better. It also answers their questions about life. I've studied some of Einstein's theories, and I still cant understand half of it. However, for less intelligent people who can't understand almost all of it, resort to a blind belief dogma. It makes them feel better, and they now understand how things work. Its the lazy way out, and they become so immersed in it that soon they can't get out. There is no question about ""life"" in the womb, as ""life"" has been in the womb before the baby got in there. The question is ""when does intelligent life begin"" or ""when does a person start existing, not just a clump of cells?"". Bible quotes are meaningless. The bible has no weight, and therefore is irrelevant in a debate like this.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","07:57 PM","abortion-debates","270"
