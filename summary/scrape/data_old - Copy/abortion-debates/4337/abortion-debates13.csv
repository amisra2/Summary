To allow one of the worst offenders to preside over one of the greatest Popes is unnacceptable. And there is no way they couldn't have known. It is like they are ignoring such behavior all together. Considering that they know about the behavior and are not taking actions aganist says much about their intentions in regards to this problem.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","07:09 PM","abortion-debates","182"
"04-24-2005","4337",13,"JPSartre12","None","The activities weren't condoned by the ""Roman Catholic Church"". It was condoned by specific US Bishops in the US, NOT Rome. There are 1.1 Billion Catholics in the world, American Catholics make up only a small fraction of those Catholics. Stop painting the Catholic Church with such a broad brush and maybe you'd regain some credibility.","simone","111701","Whoah!

The Vatican's position on abortion is seperate from how it handles child abuse in it's own ranks. However the Vatican certainly has many double standards on abortion...such as following the teachings of two ""pro-abortion"" saints but threatens anyone who dares to be pro-choice and Catholic. But I must confess some amazement for this issue: How can it be that the Christian faith is over populated with child rapists? Was there an obsecure part in the Bible where God demands Christians to rape children? I swear...you hardly ever see this with Jews, Islamics, Hindus, Buddhists and etc.. There isn't a week or two that goes by where someone finds or admits to raping a child, storing child ponorography and etc. from a Church. This isn't something only exclusive to Catholics. However the Vatican is faster at ex-communicating a woman attempting to become a priest then a priest caught sodomizing children.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","02:13 AM","abortion-debates","185"

Consider it this way: Bill Clinton speaking about how a boyfriend should act in accordance to fideilty. No one is going to believe him because has squandered all of his crediblitiy and authority. It's the same way with the Catholic Church.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","02:20 AM","abortion-debates","187"

I mean, so much for joining any of those adult dating services...I suppose becoming a priest is much easier. When will Christians such as yourself learn to stop spinning the story for your own hate agenda upon gays? Have you ever heard of accountability? A liberal mainstream media doesn't exist...simply because it is not profitable to the select few mega-billion dollar corporations who own most of the mainstream media outlets here in America. There is only a corporate media. Not liberal, not all that conservative.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","03:45 AM","abortion-debates","189"

No females allowed. Please note that. Exclusionary of females. Male only club. So...what do these exclusively male deities do in the heavens all day--well, sounds like a homosexual club to me so I just speculate on that. All these prohibitions against female power and participation smack to me of a whole bunch of folks who haven't come out of the closet and dealt honestly with their sexuality. Nothing wrong with being homosexual. Dunno about constantly repressing it and denying its existence, though.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","06:06 AM","abortion-debates","191"

Pedophiles are attracted exclusively to children. There are people, such as the case with these priests, who molest children, who are not pedophiles. Molestation, like rape, isn't about sexual attraction. It is VIOLENCE. People don't molest or rape because they are so turned on they can't help themselves, they do it to HURT somebody. Get some information before shooting off at the mouth VOR. Most of those priests were probably niether gay nor pedophiles. I HATE IT - when people spread this ****. It is FALSE information that does nothing but HARM. It puts blame on the innocent while the guilty get ignored and children get hurt.
