"03-15-2005","4337",2,"simone","None","Perhaps when the Roman Catholic Church has cleansed itself of its own sins it could have a dialogue with women about abortion--WHICH IS NOT A SIN.","Parcum","98429","That's is ridiculously poor logic. Simply becuase the church makes mistakes doesn't mean it's incorrect in all other charges. The US government is WAY more corrupt than the Catholic Church, and yet we obey every god-damned thing big brother makes us do.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","05:15 PM","abortion-debates","17"
"03-16-2005","4337",2,"Cahuella","None","The church is unfit to rule on abortion because it acts on what benefits them or they're ideas. Like what I quoted, saying that ""Thou shalt not kill."" Thousands of not millions of people are killed in wars. The Crusades is an example. It does not say ""Thou shalt not kill except when trying to claim territory or to land or if the person being killed disagrees with you religiously."" It doesn't say that. The church seems to decide when it will follow it's rules, and when not. Yes, war is sometimes a neccessary method of self defense, but the many of the Crusades were not neccessary. Most of them were failures, but Christianity is still the second biggest religion in the world (if not the first). The church can't be allowed to rule on abortion when they disregard their own laws. Like the above quote, why is the church trying to stop abortion when they would consider one to be alive after taking a breath. if you were to look at it from a scientific standpoint, the individual ovum and sperm are living cells, but they die all the time and no one cares. An embryo or fetus is something starting to develop into a human and that can't be stopped without killing it or injecting differnt DNA, but it's still not too different from sperm and ovum. If you can't trust the church to make fair decisions and follow values and morals and rules they put in place, how can you expect an honest good decision about anything from it.","maximus","98590","Cahuella, The Crusades (for the most part) were a justified reaction to Muslim aggression. If you would like to see a recent discussion of this then go to the ""Compromise"" thread on this forum and see what Simone and I discussed. As to the sperm and egg being a thing very similar to a fertilized egg..I think that may be a bit of a simplification. As to the Church making fair decisions, I believe it does. That's why it distinguishes an order of morality with degrees of goodness and badness. That's why a war may be permissable but an abortion is not. Parcum, glad to see you back. I was wondering where you had gone.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","01:16 AM","abortion-debates","19"

It's nice to see that someone moved the thread to a more reasonable stage. With 1 Billion Catholics in the world, there are bound to be some bad apples. I think that we should identify them, remove them from the basket and go about doing what is right. Two wrongs don't make a right, except in Simone's mind. Just because there are some bad priests is no reason to condemn the whole Church, IMO.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","08:36 AM","abortion-debates","20"

When the church does little to stop it, that is when you condemn the whole church.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","01:52 PM","abortion-debates","21"
"03-16-2005","4337",2,"Sigma","None","No. Settlement money is not trying to stop these actions. That is covering it up. It is keeping it quiet. Punishing those who do these things would help prevent these actions. In many cases, Ive read, they simply transfer the offender to a different area where he is not known. This is partly why I condemn the church. I never suggested it is easy to control. In fact, I believe it is something intrinsic in the church that causes it to happen, so no I do not believe this will be expunged easily. This means nothing, I still condemn the church for doing little to stop it. Given how little the church does to identify and remove them, I think a good tactic is to avoid the church altogether.","JPSartre12","98782","That WAS how it was handled in the past, but not today. IIRC, US Bishops established a zero tolerance policy in 2002 and have been actively investigating charges aggressively since at least that time period. ""Intrinsic in the Church""?! How so? See above statement on actions taken since 2002.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","04:03 PM","abortion-debates","24"
"03-16-2005","4337",2,"Parcum","None","Settlement money is far from quiet, in fact it is well known. What a foolish thing to imply the church is trying to hush victims. That's just completely ridiculous. You have absolutely no evidence to support such a claim.","simone","98815","The only reason that Roman Catholic settlement money to victims of predator priests is NOW far from quiet is because of the activities of a great many angry Catholics who insisted that these settlements be made public.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","05:11 PM","abortion-debates","26"

Moving priests around parish to parish for pedophilia was NOT common among most dioceses, only with the Boston dioecese. All priests are moved from parish to parish regardless of whether or not they're pedophiles (actually, part of the reason they do this is so that such events DON'T occur, as once priests are settled in a parish they often commit acts contrary to the church, such as adultery, homosexuality, and of course, pedophilia. The church has met dozens of times concerning this issue, and is now more strict than ever with priest ordinations. How would you solve the problem in the church, may I ask?","Sigma","98836","Simply settling is almost always preferable to a drawn out trial if you want to avoid focus on it. Which is part of why I think sexual problems are inherent in the church. And yet, just recently a gay bishop was ordained? However often they meet, it is unforgivable that it has gone on so long and is so sytematic. Me? I would dissolve the church Though, I'm not a big fan so take that with a grain of salt.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","06:38 PM","abortion-debates","27"
"03-16-2005","4337",2,"Parcum","None","What would going to trial solve? Absolutely nothing! Please explain how it is the reason for seuxal problems in the church. That Gay Bishop wasn't a Catholic one, he was Anglican. Catholics and Anglican are very much different. Catholics are Catholics, Anglicans are protestants.","Sigma","98873","And would generate bad press, etc. They wanted it to go away, so they settled. I'll answer with a question. Why would you think staying in one place would make a priest more likely to behave in an immoral way, sexually? Truly told, I could care less. I have little use for religion in general.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","08:29 PM","abortion-debates","29"
