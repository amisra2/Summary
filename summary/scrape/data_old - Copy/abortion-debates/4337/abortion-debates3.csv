"03-17-2005","4337",3,"Parcum","None","So, you want it to generate bad press? The Catholic Church certianly isn't hiding anything (the media has already publicized everything), but why go to court and give the family absolutely NO benefit, and just embarass and put guilt on the Church more. What on earth is with everyone on this forum trying to answer questions with a question? On my debate team, I would be pointed off for doing such things. I refuse to answer the question until YOU answer mine. For the record, priests are moved every six to nine years, unless the priest is given permission to leave early or stay for longer, and unless the priest is retired at a parish.","Sigma","98943","Why does it matter what I want? The church would like nothing better than for no one to know their shame. They wanted to shut the families up, so they settled. I wasn't aware this was an epidemic Refuse all you want. I have no vested interest in this discussion. The reason that priests tend to behave immorally sexually after a certain amount of time is likely the same reason I believe sexual immorality is inherent, or at least inevitable, in or because of the church teachings, doctrine and dogma.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","12:45 AM","abortion-debates","33"
"03-17-2005","4337",3,"Parcum","None","My God, do you honestly have any other evidence for your arguments other than your fantasy about the church having an evil anti-family conspiracy? What such teachings/dogma (Doctrine is dogma) are these? The reason why pedophilia is occuring in the church is because of homosexual catholics who join the priesthood to avoid sin. However, instead of avoiding sin, they walk right into it.","Sigma","98949","I don't think it has an anti-family bent, in this at least. I think that it, like any business, didn't want bad press so did what they could to limit it. Also, like an individual, they wanted their shame to be quietly put to rest. I do think you are in denial. Not everything the church does is good and pure They didn't want the accusations to come out, and they didn't want the accusations be be drug out. So they settled. Celibacy and sexual repression, in a nutshell. Would take too much time and research to give a more complete answer. I truly think that is denial of the problem. It is ignoring the problem to simply dismiss them as homosexuals (whom you condemn anyway) instead of thinking perhaps the Catholic view of sex might be a factor.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","01:08 AM","abortion-debates","35"
"03-17-2005","4337",3,"None","None","None","Tastyfish","99064","On the other hand, if you don't approve of homosexuals and they are still able to be ordained and reach fairly high places then its not beyond the scope of reason to think that a peadophile could. There is nothing much you can do without having full scale witchhunts and your own peadofinder-general, but like in any position where someone has a lot of close contact with children it makes sense to pay attention to warning signs and take accusations seriously. Not saying the church doesn't do this (though the whole controversy was caused by this not happening), but is the same level of effort to make sure comparable to teachers and school workers?","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","11:43 AM","abortion-debates","37"
"03-17-2005","4337",3,"Parcum","None","Your thesis is full of errors, Sigma. As many people don't understand in modern time, you don't seem to understand the reality and nature of sex, and what it is. In addition, you don't seem to understand the Catholic Church; I don't claim to understand it fully either, neither do I claim that the church is perfect, but you're clearly in a very closed-minded state where you believe that the Catholic Church only can be evil, as you want to keep your anti-theistic views. The truth of the matter is, there is absolutely no evidence that celibacy causes pedophilia, and in addition no evidence that the Church is evil as you make it to be. First of all, celibacy is not dogma, but is practiced only by one branch of the Catholic Church, the Western (Roman) Rite, and even then allows some exceptions, though rare. In fact, celibacy is only a symbol of obedience and commitment to the Church, and not to the family life. If it were dogmatic, we would have biblical evidence requiring priests to live celibate lives, but the only biblical evidence we have is Paul saying it was a good thing for the religious to live celibate lives. The Western Rite has kept this tradition since the 900s, I believe, but many other Catholics (such as Byzantine, Russian, Ruthenian, Anglican-Converts, Melkite, Coptic, Ethiopian, Maronite, etc.) still follow the original church law that allowed priests to marry. The Catholic Church's view on sex is the following: Sex is to keep a marriage united, and for procreation. If you use sex in any other terms, it can be detrimental to a relationship. Sex is NOT to be used when two people simply ""love"" eachother, as it means a lot more than that. Sex means absolute commitment to a relationship and willingness to have what nature brings, children. As for celibacy in the priesthood, this has absolutely nothing to do with not being able to control sexual desires and using children to fulfill them. In fact, if celibacy caused priests to molest children, it would be much more common than it is- a very, very, small number of priests molest children. Priests can easily have sexual relationships with adults, more easily than having them with children. What the church is actually suffering from is a miscommunication with men and women suffering from the homosexual disorder. Many Catholics believe that homosexuals simply ""choose"" to be homosexual, and that they can easily have relationships with the opposite sex, but such events don't occur. Especially for homosexual women, relationships with the oppisate sex can be very difficult. Hence, homosexuals seek the religious life to stay away from sin and be accepted in the Catholic community- I know of a few priests who have done this. Though this can be a good thing, many homosexuals also have pedophile tendancies, and this is where we get that VERY SMALL portion of the population that molests children. About the Catholic Church being an ""evil business"", I can't help but think that you have been completely brianwashed by popular belief in society today among non-religious and many protestants alike. The Catholic Church is no business, and is certainly not inherently evil, although much evil is in the church (mainly because this is satan's biggest threat). 1) The Journal of Sex Research reported that 32% of pedophiles are homosexual men , even though homosexual men only make up 3-4% of the population. Archives of Sexual Behavior reported that 86% of 229 convicted child molesters identified themselves as homosexual or bisexual. 2) We're not talking about rape, but about molestation. The two are different. The cases in the Catholic church were unoften rape, but molestation.","Sigma","99214","Hardly a thesis, and not even an argument. It is a personal opinion, which requires neither logic nor reason. And, of course, the church knows I have a fair idea the reality and nature of sex, moreso than any religious teachings. I've never viewed it as evil, just as self-centered and lacking in any moral authority. It's a cult, and I view it as such. I never suggested celibacy causes pedophilia, I maintain that celibacy contributes to sexual immorality. I am curious how many of the priests who molest these children were celibate, whether or not it was part of the practice of their particular branch. Why don't these others agree with Paul that it is a good thing? I'll propose an alternative view. Sex, whether between Catholics, Hindus, Christians, Buddists, Jews or any other religion or lack thereof usually means that one or both parties were horny. Truly, I see so little use for the rules and restricts that the church places upon it's members. I can see no benefit to life, in fact I see a decrease in the joy and pleasure I take in life to be a part of that. More than that the entire premise seems ridiculous. And aren't there a very very small number of priests practising celibacy? That seems to match up. I wouldn't know. Your assertion that all these priests could ""easily"" have relationship with other adults and all of the molesting priests must have been homosexual is not something I believe. There is no way I can prove it, but neither can you. I don't think I said it was evil. I said sexual immorality is inherent or inevitable given the system in place. That doesn't seem to support your view. The majority of pedophiles are straight, according to this. Why 229? Where they taken from a specific place? That number seems awfully specific, so it implies that it was taken from a specific sample. Molestation also depends on availability.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","04:05 PM","abortion-debates","39"
