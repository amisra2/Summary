The Christian Century; 1/16/2002 Pope John Paul II has moved quietly to give the Vatican's highest doctrinal authority direct control over the growing problem of pedophile priests, the official Vatican gazette has disclosed. The pope and Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, have ordered bishops to inform the Vatican immediately of any accusations of pedophilia against priests and instructed them to swiftly investigate any suspicion of pedophilia within ... Also, the Cops don't shuffle around known law breakers and refuse to tell the public. Also, the cops don't glorify a known law breaker, they send the sucker to prison. While the cops do have their problems: they don't pretend like they don't exist. Seriously, was that some **** poor attempt at trying to get me back?","JPSartre12","112742","No, they claim to be the supreme non-secular authority. Really? And guess who cardinal Joseph Ratzinger is today. Pope Benedict XVI. He was known in the Vatican as ""The Enforcer"". If you think that the Vatican is giving a free pass to wayward pedophile priests, you're sadly mistaken. What a joke. You're going to attempt to tell me, with a straight face, that cops don't look out for their fellow cops? Sorry, NO SALE. No, that was my attempt to show how ludicrous your argument was. The Catholic Church has 1.1 Billion members in over 100 countries.

If they were, why is that they can be supeoned by the courts, or have their allegations tossed out or be tried themselves? OH wait, because they don't claim any supreme authority whatsoever. Dog and pony show . If that was true, they wouldn't have glorified Cardinal Mass. The cops don't glorify one of the worst offenders in record history . Has Benedict stripped mass of all powers? No he has not, nevermind the fact that Mass has been proven on several occasions to be a pedophile, molester priests. More dog and pony show. Sure cops do look out for each other, but they don't even remotely come close to the Vatican. You do know there are a sizable number of former police behind bars? Can you say the same for the Catholic Church? No, you can't. Interesting how you've avoided the specific problem the Church has done. Have the cops moved known repeat offenders around the country without telling the public? You're in serious trouble if you think you just did that. You're skills are getting rusty.

"04-27-2005","4337",16,"Linus","None","I don't have to because the poster asked, ""I would be interested to hear of the two pro-abortion saints you mentioned."" So two ""pro-abortion"" saints are named. But if you personally want proof, here. St. Augustine reversed centuries of Christian teaching in Western Europe, and returned to the Aristotelian concept of ""delayed ensoulment."" He wrote that a human soul cannot live in an unformed body. Thus the fetus wasn't alive before it had formed body. St. Jerome wrote, ""The seed gradually takes shape in the uterus, and it [abortion] does not count as killing until the individual elements have acquired their external appearance and their limbs"" St. Thomas Aquinas considered abortion of an ""animated"" fetus as murder. So before five months it was okay to have an abortion. http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_hist.htm","maximus","113238","Linus, Your terminology is misleading and your assertion is false. There were never and will never be any Catholic Saints who are ""pro-abortion."" The information you cite does not refute the fact that the Church has always condemned abortion. It does show that there has been some theological debate as to when a person was ""ensouled."" This stemmed partly from the fact that the process of pregnancy was not fully known. Augustine chose the point of ""quickening"" or first movement as the point of ensoulment because that very well might have been the first evidence of life in the womb at that time. But as soon as it was deemed that a soul was present then abortion was denounced as an evil. He was pro-life from the instant he knew life was there. For Christians, teaching on protecting human life in the womb has never been a gray area. Although knowledge of when that life began has been enlightened by science and technology--the child in the womb has always been worthy of protection in the Christian view--at the time when it was known that life/soul was present then the being was deemed worthy of protection.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","08:48 PM","abortion-debates","229"

Augustine, Aquinas and even Jerome authorized the use of abortion since killing a fetus without a soul was no biggie. This would make them, as you pro-lifers like to say, pro-abortion. Actually it does. So theology works alongside with anatomy now? This is moottheology is not based on science but instead belief. Even the belief that ensoulment beginning at conception doesnt make any sense and goes against the nature of Christian dualism.","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","06:23 AM","abortion-debates","230"
"05-10-2005","4337",16,"maximus","None","Simone, You do not believe abortion to be a moral question? I assume with this statement that you believe in allowing abortion up to the point of birth. If so, then you are one of the most extreme pro-choicers around. If you do believe this being in the womb is worthy of protection at some point--any point along the way--then you have given it some sort of right as a person. If that enters in then this is a moral question. Do you believe abandonment of a pregnant mother by the father a moral issue? Or is it simply a legal, financial, or medical decision? Do you believe an assault on a pregnant mother that results in injury to the zygote/fetus/embryo to be a moral issue or something other? I am trying to understand now why you say you don't believe a life long marriage to be ""good"" yet those who did not adhere to this mode were badly thought of. I'm trying to understand why a life-long marriage is not necessarily a ""good"" thing in your opinion yet it involved love, fidelity, and honor. These things are not good? So you said what you thought and spoke the truth but you didn't say what you thought or speak the truth in relation to marriage? You thought about the ideas that life-long, love-match, loyal marriages were good yet you didn't speak about it? And when one speaks about it as Christians generally do then that is ""intruding into the marriages of others?"" and not simply speaking the truth about one's beliefs? I need a break. I'm a bit dizzy. I'm glad that you are finally admitting that you agree with Christianity so much.","simone","120026","Maximus, would you be so kind as to point out to me where I stated that abortion should be allowed to the point of birth. I hold views in accord with United States law in this regard. When a fetus reaches the point at which it is viable outside of the womb abortion is strictly controlled (as it should be) and allowable only in cases of possible death to the pregnant woman or of extreme health hazard to her. As long as a fertized egg, zygote, embryo, fetus is dependent upon a woman's body for continued life it is a woman's choice to decree whether or not she yields her body to the welfare of the aforesaid entities. I do believe that women should, whenever possible, decide to terminate as early as possible in the course of the pregnancy as this is the medically safest time for abortion. Maximus, you are welcome at any time to cede ownership of your body to a fertilized egg, zygote, embryo, fetus, etc., with my good wishes. It is your body after all and it is not my responsibility to dictate to you what you do with it--as long as you are not harming yourself or others. Abandonment of a pregnant woman is so common throughout the world that we have not begun in the slightest degree to acquaint men with their responsibilities in regard to their sexuality. Men are empowered by patriarchal religions to have sexual access to as many women as they can seduce, rape, kidnap or otherwise secure with very few consequences, in most cases the victims, the women themselves, are punished for the transgressions of the men as if they were the criminal. This has been the case until very recently in most of the Christian world. I am intimately acquainted with views on the issue of rape within the United States because I was part of a public relations campaign to educate Americans about the issue of rape--that a woman is not the cause of rape because she was ""slutty,"" ""dressed provocatively,"" ""was in the wrong place,"" ""because she wore trousers,"" ""because she was riding a bike,"" (I was kicked out of a courtroom over the last statement because I screamed in outrage at the stupid judge who made the last pronouncement in regard to a rape victim. I have had prominent men in the media industry tell me that the rape victim ""should just lean back and enjoy it."" Unfortunately, there are still a lot of people in America who still hold these views and a great many more in the rest of the world. An attack on a woman is an attack on a woman and should be punished by law. Are you assuming that a woman could be viciously attacked and only the fertilized egg, zygote, embryo, fetus would suffer injury? Um, Maximus, would you be so kind as to point out precisely where I stated that life-long marriage is not good, I am trying to understand your muddled statement also. Maximus, what are you trying to say? I happen to espouse a great many beliefs about what morality is but I do not burden others with the weight of my various beliefs. What is your point? No, it's not that I agree with Christianity, it's that much of Christianity agrees with me. After all, the views of my honorable ancestors were around long before the advent of Christianity and if Christians chose to adopt many of our values, excellent!","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","10:00 AM","abortion-debates","233"

That said, the debate over when a fetus is human/not/viable/not will go on. But I need to address the following points: Any being that is removed from its environment will die. The environment for a fetus is the womb, until such time as it grows mature enough to survive outside this environment. It is still a living organism which is being killed through the actions of others, regardless of whether it's viable or not at the time the ""procedure"" is performed. By comparison, if you take a 2 year old child out of the environment (safe home w/parents) they are being raised in, and put them somewhere else alone, say the local national park (or even the backyard pool) they will die. Does the fact that this child hasn't grown enough to survive outside the environment they are ready for make killing them ok? Yes. There are documented cases of a woman losing a child after a XXXX to the belly, which although it caused pain for the woman did not result in any injury.

Wednesday, March 30, 2005 Teen: Girl consented to abortion with bat Lawyer asks judge to dismiss charge against 16-year-old Richmond boy. By Jim Lynch / The Detroit News A 16-year-old Richmond boy could not have assaulted his girlfriend because she consented to being beaten with a miniature baseball bat to induce her miscarriage, his attorney argued Tuesday. The boy faces a felony charge of intentional conduct against a pregnant individual resulting in miscarriage or stillbirth, which could result in his remaining in custody until age 21. He is alleged to have struck his 16-year-old Armada Township girlfriend in the stomach over three weeks. Defense attorney Miranda Massie made arguments to support her request for a dismissal in the case. Judge Matt Switalski is expected to rule later on the argument. ""If you consent, there is no assault, plain and simple,"" she said, adding, ""there is no Michigan law to the contrary."" By asking her ""best friend and boyfriend"" to hit her with the bat, Massie argued the girl, now 17, was exercising her right to have an abortion. Therese Tobin, chief trial attorney for the Macomb Prosecutor's Office, said there is no state law that says a person can consent to battery. And she added, ""a person is not free to get an abortion at certain stages without public intervention."" The judge questioned whether the girl, at 16, was in a position to offer her consent. ""Did she enter into a valid contract?"" he asked. ""... In essence, she's getting herself an abortion without availing herself of what the Legislature says she has to do."" Switalski asked the defense to submit answers to a series of questions concerning the consent argument by April 8. Defense attorneys also plan to use the cause of death as a basis for dismissing the charges. Switalski did not hear arguments on that issue Tuesday. In January, Macomb County Medical Examiner Dr. Daniel Spitz ruled the fetus died of premature birth associated with trauma to the mother. In a brief filed earlier this month, Massie argued that there is no scientific way to determine exactly what caused the miscarriage in this case. ""Causation of miscarriage and fetal death defies scientific determination more than 50 percent of the time,"" she wrote. ""In this case, there was no prenatal medical care or observation and no medical care or observation at the time of the miscarriage, making reliable assessment of the cause of (the girl's) miscarriage impossible."" http://www.detnews.com/2005/macomb/0...C05-133229.htm","JPSartre12","120840","Huh?

While, ok, you can't prove it, everyone and their mother knows that repeated blows to a pregnant woman's belly will injure or kill the fetus. But she allowed him to do it, so there is some culpability for her, IMO. My thoughts are that....wait we're talking about kids, ok I agree with you on the legality.. But had this been between adults, I'd say that whatever they did in the privacy of their own home, as long as both were not under the influence and agreed to it, should be legal. He was beating her? If she liked it and asked him to and no permanent harm came of it, go right ahead. I'm sure there are websites full of that sort of behavior. Not my thing, but I respect their (adult) decision to do what they want. Maybe the kids didn't have the $$ to see a doctor.
