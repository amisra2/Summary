Whenever I see a sentence begin with 'obviously' I say, ""ut oh"" (but I confess I sometimes do it too and when I catch it I say the same thing - ut oh). Let me see if I have the meaning of that sentence correct. It states that since the synagogue authorities allowed Jesus to preach, then Jesus couldn't possibly be a carpenter. Does that make any sense to any of you? I mean, I'm a janitor by trade and my pastor allows me to preach sometimes, yet I'm still a janitor by trade. Did the Jews have some kind of law forbidding a carpenter from preaching? Nope. Also, I do not recall Jesus needing anyone's permission to do anything. He was, after all, God. God doesn't need our permission, we need His. The only place I know of in the New Testament where someone commands Jesus was His mom Mary - when she said, ""there's no more wine."" and He said, ""woman, what's that to me?"" and she turns to the servant and says, ""do whatever He tells you to do."" And so began Jesus' ministry. But then God did say ""Honor your mother and your father."" and He sure did set a wonderful example. Mark 6:3 (KJV) Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him. "" And they were offended at Him."" they're not the only ones, hu? "" Is this not the carpenter, the son of Mary ..."" I see it's a very explicit sentence, it means what it says and it says what it means. Some folks say things like, ""there are books missing from the Bible"" or ""well, it could be that it was written like such and such ..."" one thing about opinions is, everyone has one. As I mentioned earlier, it's God's opinion I seek, not my own. Afterall, He's the one who invented opinons, and thinking and reasoning, the earth, all creation and the spirit realm .... Jesus is a very busy God. What do you think about the other stuff, like the proof I gave for the accuracy of Holy Scripture?","catholic-church-unfit-rule-abortion","01:26 AM","abortion-debates","287"
