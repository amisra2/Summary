"10-06-2008","3173",12,"Phyllis","326557","I have only made the common sense statement that we lock people up against their will all the time for things.","Colonel Ingus","326559","No we don't! We lock up CRIMINALS who have commited a crime. Big difference! What crime did an innocent woman who just happens to be pregnant commit? You have NO right to force pregnant women to do ANYTHING against their will. Your hitler mentality just doesn't fly. Just because you don't like these women you want to be able to manipulate and control them. You should be ashamed of yourself for trying to exploit these women at a time in their lives when they are most vulnerable","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","10:56 PM","abortion-debates","168"
"10-06-2008","3173",12,"Phyllis","326557","In the United States, solicitation for murder will land one in prison. We punish law breakers, and that is what I am suggesting.","chester","326561","Silly you. Solicitation IS a crime. In the law, solicitation, conspiracy, and attempt are called PRELIMINARY, not PROSPECTIVE criminal acts. You specifically said PROSPECTIVE criminal act. It's only the difference between night and day. For a person who says words in the Constitution have an absolute definition that is fixed for all time, you're quite sloppy in your definitions. Now, want to explain how the words NO LAW in 1a are an absolute bar to prosecutions for disseminating kiddie porn. Under your ""originalist"" interpretation, not only would it not be a PROSPECTIVE crime, it would not be criminal at all. If you want to ""change the law"", you first need to understand it.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","11:33 PM","abortion-debates","170"
"10-06-2008","3173",12,"Phyllis","326560","There, fixed it. Criminals are people too I have not suggested we lock up innocent women. These statements of yours simply make no sense. Society has every right to compel a pregnant woman not to murder her child's father no matter how much she may wish to I merely seek to change the law. I merely seek to change the law [so that it's legal to manipulate pregnant women].","Colonel Ingus","326564","So what are you trying to tell everyone, that you don't know the differance between a criminal and a regular person, or that you think they both should be treated exactly the same? Straw Man argument. You don't have to, you already admitted that you think it's OK to manipulate or force them to do something against their own will? Wow ... you don't think that a pregnant woman should be protected from manipulation or doing something against her own will? What are you a misogynist? What does what one ADULT does to another ADULT have to do with a ZEF? Apples and oranges. There, fixed it.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","11:56 PM","abortion-debates","171"
"10-07-2008","3173",12,"Phyllis","326572","So do you, or do you not, support laws making it a crime for even pregnant women to murder others no matter what she herself happens to want? If so, you support forcing pregnant women to do something that she may not want to do. There is nothing profound or shocking in this fact. I won't go around libelously proclaiming that you support rape simply because you might think that even pregnant women can be forced to do things against their will (like go to prison for a murder or pay a traffic fine). The purpose of the law is to impose duties on a person no matter if they happen to want those duties or not. And this goes for both men and women.","chester","326574","I hope that you are well aware of the fact that if we allow government to pass a law which today can force a woman against her will to carry her fetus to term can someday be the government which will be able to force a woman against her will to abort her fetus. Sorry, but that is a place where the law intrudes at its, and our, peril","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","08:07 AM","abortion-debates","173"
"10-07-2008","3173",12,"Phyllis","326572","You support locking some criminals up, and you support doing so without their consent. I have said that I think it is ok to force any law breaker, male or female, to do things that they may not want to do. do you, or do you not, support laws making it a crime for even pregnant women to murder others no matter what she herself happens to want?","Colonel Ingus","326583","No, criminals give you consent because they already know that when they get caught that they will be punished for it. Rob a bank, use a gun, automatic jail time. Of course they don't want to get caught, but they know the consequences ahead of time. You may not know this, but you are NOT supposed to treat a criminal like a normal person and vice versa. Your argument is completely null. Since when can men get pregnant, and since when is the act of getting pregnant considered breaking the law? Once a fetus has been born then they are protected. If a woman is still pregnant then she may do with her own body what she wants, including the removal of any parasite trying to do her harm. She has the right to protect herself.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:58 AM","abortion-debates","174"
"10-07-2008","3173",12,"syklopps61","68103","C'MON, I bet ""pro-choicers"" would rejoice in the discovery of even an amoeba on Mars, screaming that there is life on another planet, and yet it grows inside a woman everyday and they dicard it without a blink of an eye. And don't give me this ""tough decision"" BS...it's a selfish copout to have an abortion perhaps 99.9% of the time","Archangel","326586","WOW, I have never seen a more applicable and logical example of the pro-death proponents hypocrisy and double standards regarding the issue of what defines life. This post is absolutely true in that every single pro abortion defender who claims a child in the womb is either not alive or is not a person, would instantly cling to, and defend the discovery of a single celled amoeba that was found on another Planet even, as LIFE. It's another example of the inconsistency of their selfish gospel. Much like their stance against the death penalty for murderers, as they promote and defend the murder of the totally innocent unborn, in the womb, It makes no sense at all.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","10:09 AM","abortion-debates","175"

You don't? Why are we not surprised? Be that as it may, it's still none of your, my, or the law's business to inquire whether or why a woman chooses to either continue or terminate a pregnancy.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","10:47 AM","abortion-debates","176"

In either case, the government is denying choice to a pregnant woman. If we live in the world of Big Brother, then they are equally moral . I can hardly wait for you to drop your feather hammer in your follow-up, which we all know is coming. You're about as subtle as a Taser.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","03:45 PM","abortion-debates","178"

Now we can move to more advanced questions. Try this one: Are the following three scenarios just as moral as each other: (1) Government forcing a woman to have an abortion; (2) Government forceing her not to have an abortion; and (3) Government allowing her to decide for herself whether to have an abortion?","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","04:29 PM","abortion-debates","179"
