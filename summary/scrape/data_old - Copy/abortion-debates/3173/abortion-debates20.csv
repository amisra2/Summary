Do you deny that your question was worded as ""If a woman was say 2 weeks from term and she wanted to terminate"". Those are YOUR words are they not? To deny them would conflict with what history has recorded on this forum Do you deny that in most late term abortions as outlined in our post that it is the doctor that brings up the subject? Time for you to be completely honest with yourself and everyone else here","gansao","327590","So you think everyone else but you is here a fool do you ? You slice and dice / cut and paste all you like if it makes you better but dont expect to be taken seriously... please?","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","03:43 PM","abortion-debates","286"
