Our Constitution says we have the ""Right to Life"", does it not?","chester","326282","NOT AT ALL! The Constitution refers, in the 14th Amendment only to persons ""born or naturalized."" The census only counts lives in being; a fetus is not counted. Also, nowhere in the Constitution is the phrase ""Right to Life"" ever used. Now tell us: 1. Why you would make the pregnant woman a slave to her fetus. 2. Why you believe the government is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is. and 3. Why, when there are many differing values among good, moral people as to when personhood begins, why the government should enshrine one metaphysical belief above all others.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:47 AM","abortion-debates","121"

Remember, slavery in any form was made illegal under the 13th ammendment to the US Constitution on Dec 6, 1865. If you do not live in the U.S. then you should know that on December 10th, 1948 the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in Article 4 it now states: ' No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms. ' Oh and LovedbyGod8, please don't try to weasel out of directly answering his question. To do so would prove ( to us and to yourself subconsciously ) that you are wrong and not thinking logically about this, a bit redundant I know.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","01:05 PM","abortion-debates","122"

"10-05-2008","3173",9,"syklopps61","67800","I think it's a bit of a stretch to say that the pro-life argument relies exclusively on religious doctrine. I'm a Conservative and religious, but I think that abortion can be discussed without bringing religion into it. My personal opinion is it's a mistake for Pro-lifers to bring religion into it because it fuels the hatred of the God-less Left LMAO","simone","326407","I wouldn't call those who adhere only to the Old Testament Godless. You are extremely mistaken in your views. I must also add, extremely narrow and intolerant. According to the Old Testament, abortion or the causing the accidental abortion of a fetus is not murder.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","11:42 AM","abortion-debates","125"

Its meaning is used correctly here as anti-choicers want the pregnant woman to become subservient to the ZEF. This magnifies the absurdity of anti-choicers so-called ""reasoning"". They want to have an organism which hasn't even taken its first breath of air, hasn't taken its first step on the very ground of this country, hasn't a social security card or ever paid any taxes - and they want to give it more rights and control an actual person who has a real life, a family, and quite possibly is needed to support other living/breathing children. In other words, without earning it, they want to give this parasite (ZEF) complete control over the woman and make her subservient to said ZEF Simply put, a ZEF should not be able to use the womans body as an incubator against the womans will, for that is pure slavery - and slavery in any form is against the law! Hey listen, if these XXXXXX want to give the ZEF rights then that's fine. As soon as the woman is found to be pregnant they should separate the ZEF from the womans body and let the ZEF do as it pleases - oh wait , that's technically referred to as an abortion now isn't it? Well that proves the point that the womans body shouldn't be used as an incubator against the womans will. The woman is a real-living-breathing person and she has real rights. She is not acting as a parasite like the ZEF is. To give the ZEF ANY control what-so-ever over the woman is completely absurd. The ZEF is - at best - a medical graft technically known as a semiallogenic graft, and grafts do NOT have any legal rights in this, or any other country.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","12:35 PM","abortion-debates","126"

Words are a unit of language and if you feel that any of those words don't accurately describe their given context then give it your best shot. I'm sure you'll use words that we've all heard before too","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","02:38 PM","abortion-debates","128"

I know, I took the your words out of contexts, but the intention toward ZEF remains the same. I can only conclude that the inability to perceive ZEF as human is based on some form a prejudice. To me, a XXXXX, it seems logical, based on purely biological evidence that ZEF is a unique human being. As such, ZEF is afforded certain human rights, which must be absolute and not variable.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","04:40 PM","abortion-debates","131"

Either a foetus is a human, (in which case the mother is enslaved by it) or it is not (in which case on what grounds do you object to abortions?) Either way, there is a problem. Also - have you not heard the phrase 'he was a slave to the TV/Telephone/drugs/alcohol/other'?","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","05:09 PM","abortion-debates","133"

Agreed, however - in a purely legal sense, the zygote is not willingly enslaving a woman. Using that argument, however, if a zygote has no provable will how can you prove it has a mental state beyond reflex?","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","05:57 PM","abortion-debates","135"
