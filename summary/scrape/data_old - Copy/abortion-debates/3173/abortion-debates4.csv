It does sound like you have issues.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:38 AM","abortion-debates","46"
"09-28-2004","3173",4,"syklopps61","None","NAAAAA, actually it makes ME sound quite sane...I'm not denying a woman the ""right"" to have sex all she wants. THere ARE ways of having sex WITHOUT getting pregnant, I'm sure you'd agree. SO, it actually makes YOU sound like you are desperately hanging on to the ""right"" to take an innocent life just because you don't want to be inconvenienced. In Bizarro world, you might be right, but not in reality","sinjin","68871","Since only abstinence is 100% effective you are in effect suggesting that unless you're prepared to raise a child, don't have sex. A return to controlling women's sex lives through negative social pressure is the objective of the pro-life movement, not saving babies. If every pro-lifer was an adoptive parent I think they would have more credibility.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","04:21 PM","abortion-debates","48"

This is akin to saying that every pro-choicer should have to have an abortion -- or at least face that choice personally -- in order to be a credible pro-choicer.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","04:38 PM","abortion-debates","49"

I support your right to consume porn even if I don't care to. I support your right to choose. My point was simply I would be more likely to believe you a ""saver of unwanted babies"" if you were actively saving one not just proposing that they should be ""saved"".","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","04:52 PM","abortion-debates","50"
"09-28-2004","3173",4,"syklopps61","None","MY GOD, PLEASE tell me that you hold politicians to this same criteria then!!! I know this is a little off the topic, but it needs to be said...we have Liberal politicians and activists who claim to care for the poor and starving, push for policies to ""help"" these people, but do little or NOTHING to change the problem themselves, i.e., taking the poor in, giving enough money DIRECTLY from their own pocket to feed a starving family. We Conservatives are considered EVIL because we DON'T push the policies, but rather prefer doing things on our own to help. I expect to get a few laughs from your side on that one, but seems to me if the shoe fits....Do you consider the Democrats/Liberals saviors of the poor? Seeing my point, no doubt you will say no, but then that wouldn't be consistent with a Liberal way of thinking","Sigma","68935","Agreed, but I don't think any politician actually practises what they preach. We aren't politicians.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","08:34 PM","abortion-debates","53"
"09-28-2004","3173",4,"syklopps61","None","So one COULD say that Republicans/Conservatives are closer to being LESS hypocritical...afterall, we don't make claims that we are so compassionate, using government programs as a measure that is ;-)","Sigma","68942","er, ""compassionate conservative""? Republicans (I can't call them conservative) are just as hypocritical and neither do they keep promises they make. We aren't talking about politicians or politics. We were talking about whether or not you personally help out with born babies.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:21 PM","abortion-debates","55"
"09-28-2004","3173",4,"syklopps61","None","I refuse to accept that absurd premise that in order for me to have credibility, I'm supposed to get a woman pregnant and then give it up for adoption, THAT'S a crock and YOU know it. I've had three children....","Sigma","68945","Actually, for you to have credibility with me you would have to get pregnant and be in each and every situation that a pregnant woman can be into. If you cannot, I do not believe you can say what a woman can do with her body.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:42 PM","abortion-debates","57"
"09-28-2004","3173",4,"None","None","None","syklopps61","68948","Just out of curiosity, would any of you support abortions based on what the child might look like, or what sex they are? I mean, what if a female fetus was considered useless and a drain and there were mass abortions based solely on that?","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:56 PM","abortion-debates","59"
"09-29-2004","3173",4,"syklopps61","None","Well, at least you are consistently juvenile. This is the same stupid argument that some use...if you haven't been in a war, you can't comment on it. For you to have any degree of credibility, you would need to mature and stop killing little babies","Sigma","68953","Er, you really do have to have been in battle to have any idea what it is really like. That's why they don't want politicians to run wars. I'm juvenile? Is that why you've been unable to answer my argument? You just sort of... stopped","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","12:03 AM","abortion-debates","60"
