I doubt you can cite Scalia as an activist in First Amendment cases when he has voted to overturn bans on flag burning. You really should try to think before you speak; or perhaps you actually did, in which case we should simply conclude that you have no idea what you are talking about. Regardless, any decision that holds that something is in the Constitution, when in fact it really is not, is wrong and merits reversal no matter which judges perpetrate the wrong decision. You didn't answer it there, and you still won't answer it here. How do you plan to get around the fact that the words NO LAW are in the Constitution? Guess you will have a L--O--N--G wait until you get my answer.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:25 PM","abortion-debates","152"

The discussion went on for several pages, and you are free to read it again if you like. And the question is, are each of the following three scenarios just as moral as the other: (1) Government forcing a woman to have an abortion; (2) Government forcing her not to have an abortion; and (3) Government taking no position whatsoever on the question of abortion, leaving the decision to each individual woman.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","10:38 PM","abortion-debates","93"

If it were, I would be forced to take every word you ever say and interpret it to mean whatever I think it ought to mean, and you would have no objective basis to say that my interpretation was wrong. The result is a breakdown in language and an impossibility to communicate. I have already addressed your ""no law"" question. If you are too lazy to read the answer that is not my problem; it is yours. You, on the other hand, have no where answered the questions I asked, and so my ignorance of your answer is not due to my laziness, but rather it is due to your unwillingness to answer some very simple questions. I'll repost them both for your convenience, but not because I think you'll answer them, but because I think you won't. And I think you won't answer them because, being a moral relativist, your answer would be very shocking indeed. Do you really believe that what Hitler did was just as moral as what Wilberforce did? Do you really believe that exterminating 6 million Jews is just as moral as liberating an entire race from the institution of slavery? Are each of the following three scenarios just as moral as the other: (1) Government forcing a woman to have an abortion; (2) Government forcing her not to have an abortion; and (3) Government taking no position whatsoever on the question of abortion, leaving the decision to each individual woman.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","11:47 PM","abortion-debates","285"

See, it IS relative. Now, let's pose another one. Since Stalin was responsible for far more murders that Hitler, who was more immoral? Is the murder of a kulak or a Ukrainian or a White Russian or a political opponent by Stalin of less importance than the murder of a Jew by Hitler? Better yet, who is more immoral, the one who takes the life of a person in being, or the one who removes a parasite from another's body? The doctor who performs an abortion on a woman who chooses to have one is the moral equivalent of Wilberforce, for she or he has freed the woman from enslavement by her ZEF. There simply is no moral equivalence between a person in being and a ZEF.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","12:10 AM","abortion-debates","196"

The fact that a difference of opinion exists does not mean every opinion is equally correct, or that none of the opinions, to the exclusion of all the others, is true. You skirted the issue again. I asked what you believe. I realize that you really are trying to avoid having to either admit that absolutes exist, or that your worldview will not allow you to see Hitler's genocide as being morally different from Wilberforce's liberation of the salves. But come on, show a little courage and answer this very simple question: Do you really believe that what Hitler did was just as moral as what Wilberforce did?

Did we support the wrong bloody tyrant in WWII? Is Stalin more immoral than Hitler, and what are the ""universal standards"" that you would use to judge? I will not take part in your silly Jesuitical word games. As to Hitler/Wilberforce, the answer still depends on whom you ask. If it were the family of people murdered at Auschwitz, then Hitler was a monster. If it were a Ukrainian whose family was starved by Stalin in the Great Famine of 1934, Hitler was an emancipator ala Wilberforce. See, there are no universals which control.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","11:30 AM","abortion-debates","124"
