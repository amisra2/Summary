Every single thing that we have posted here is FACTUALLY correct and has been documented! In-fact, most of them have even been double or triple documented. It is your right to remain ignorant on a topic if you wish, no one here is forcing you to learn anything, but just because you wish to stay ignorant on this topic and "" don't like the facts "" does not give you the right to break the forums rules and throw out demeaning insults at other forum members . It is clear gansao that you did not join this thread to debate the topic. You have yet to post a single documented fact. All you've posted in this thread has been unsubstantiated opinions, and when someone proves them wrong you post demeaning insults toward them. We will see if the Admin allows such behavior. As an Admin of several other forums, I'm pretty sure they took the time and effort to put those forum rules in place for a reason. Just because you don't like those rules gansao, does not give you the right to circumvent them.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","03:12 PM","abortion-debates","257"
"10-10-2008","3173",18,"None","None","None","gansao","327291","Talk of the pot calling the kettle black! There is no evidence that a fetus is a parasite because a fetus is NOT a parasite. It is a idiotic claim. You jumped on the insult wagon way , way down the line and now you call for the admin. You actually used a clip from youtube as evidence of your claim and claim that educated people would believe this scurrilous rubbish. there is plenty of documented evidence of anything that you want to believe. This is what I am trying to point out. Your claim is an opinion but armed with your dictionary and youtube to you its a fact. There is a body of opinion that all men are rapists and all women are whores, I didnt invent it, but its just as valid as the rubbish you are putting forward. Its just that you dont like it! Just as I said before, try your theory out on the general public and you will find that the majority of people are uninformed simpletons like me not clever dictionary owners like you. However if I was to tell people of your theory then ask them about your mother and father I think that they would be firmly on my side . Does that mean we are all failed second graders or you are wrong !","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","03:26 PM","abortion-debates","258"

If one wants to call it a baby from the moment of conception and not abort it, good for them. If someone else wants to call it a ZEF and terminate her pregnancy, good fopr her as well. The simple fact remains that, under a system of choice, no one will be forced into terminating her pregnancy On the other hand, giving the government the power to ban abortion today implies the power to require it tomorrow. There the government and our society go at their peril.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","04:18 PM","abortion-debates","261"

I think there should be a little more power given to the state in this matter. I can see what you are saying and I understand your point that you can call the fetus whatever you want. However I do not agree that you can logically define a fetus as a parasite. I will debate this with you if you like and I promise not to insult your mother , your aunt is another thing.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","04:58 PM","abortion-debates","263"

"10-10-2008","3173",18,"gansao","327257","What you say is a well balanced view of the pravailing argument. Except for one thing..that you give the argument that a fetus has anything in common with a parasite at all. A fetus is created in the body and expelled through a tube between the legs , so is a turd! How seroiusly would you consider this theory?","Another opinion","327323","Here, I was trying to differentiate between the way a term (in this case, parasite) is officially defined compared to the way it is commonly used. The official definition of parasite is (from the Myrriam-Webster online dictionary): 1 : a person who exploits the hospitality of the rich and earns welcome by flattery 2 : an organism living in, with, or on another organism in parasitism 3 : something that resembles a biological parasite in dependence on something else for existence or support without making a useful or adequate return Technically, one might classify the fetus as a parasite in this case since it does seem to fit definitions 2 and/or 3 - ex. that it is indeed a living organism living in another organism. So, I would agree with those here who argue that technically it fits the definition. However, we all know that there are various automatically assumed meanings that get attached to words and, therefore, using the term ""parasite"" for a fetus is quite misleading. Every other instance of the use of the term parasite (at least that I have ever heard mentioned) carries all of the connotations listed in my earlier post - connotations that do not apply to the embryo/fetus. So, once again, calling a fetus a parasite might be technically correct but practically misleading - so I would object to calling it a parasite.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","05:43 PM","abortion-debates","265"
"10-10-2008","3173",18,"None","None","None","gansao","327328","Contrary to some peoples slights I do own a dictionary, although I am familiar enough with my own language not to have to refer to it very often! I usually get the words right but not necessarily in the correct order( missed that lesson apparently). In fact the dictionary that I own is the Oxford English dictionary printed by the Oxford university press( An English dictionary printed in England by one of the two major seats of learning in the country..beat that!) Parasite..1 an organism living in or on another and benefiting at the expense of the other. If the fetus is an organism living in or on another organism then by definition is a seperate entity from the host( mother) therefore abortion amounts to killing another seperate creature, we just cant have that , the pro choice cannot accept that.Also if a mother exclusively suckles her baby by this definition the baby will be a parasite long after it is born. benefitting at the expense of the of the other...well they do that long after birth. This would make them a parasite up to the point that they leave home...so obviously that would be nonsense . Comparing your strapping 16 year old with a tape worm is silly..lacking sense, foolish,imprudent, unwise ( Oxford English dictionary) However definition no 2( there are only 2 and as this is the Oxford English dictionary so there ARE only 2, no arguing!) is a person who lives off or exploits another or others ..so there we have it despite my lack of education I have solved the problem..it is not the fetus that is the parasite it the teenager. Should we cull them? No of course not! What we should do is stop being silly and start being sensible...having shown wisdom or common sense, reasonable, judicious( Oxford English dictionary) and accept that this is rubbish Mr Lingus look carefully and this will educate..give intellectual, moral and social instruction to a pupil esp a child( Oxford English dictionary) you. I have been instructed to be informative and friendly. One out of two isnt bad. I also have a friendly professor to back me up..not really, its an article that I Googled but its better than youtube.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","06:34 PM","abortion-debates","266"

What I have concluded is that the existence of multiple perspectives in no way demonstrates that all the perspectives are equally true. The existence of many opinions does not prove that one of those opinions, to the exclusion of all others, is true.","chester","327428","Except yours, of course, but thanks for proving my point.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","10:59 AM","abortion-debates","268"
