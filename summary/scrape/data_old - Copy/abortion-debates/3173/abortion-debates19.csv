It's also a gender question. I do not believe that a man has the right to an opinion on the question of whether a woman should or should not end her pregnancy. Of course, in the long run, all questions in the USA become political. It's very much a political question of whether the government has the right to intrude to this degree on a woman's privacy. It's also very much a political question as to whether men have the right to control women by enacting statutes that would interfere with her right to determine the future of her pregnancy.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","12:18 PM","abortion-debates","271"

I know that this would occur very very rarely but eventually it would occur.. If a woman was say 2 weeks from term and she wanted to terminate then, would you still be in favour of her doing so? This question is not a feeble attempt to set a trap, I am asking you respectfully what is the absolute limit that you think the responsibilty can still be left with the mother!","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","12:49 PM","abortion-debates","272"

I think that the question really should be put in terms of whether the woman's interest or that of the fetus takes precedence. In light of the extremely small number of abortions done that late, I don't think it is a question that need concern us, especially in light of the fact that, at that point the overwhelming number of that extremely small number (no, I'm not trying to mislead) are done for purely medical reasons. I would have to go with the idea that the interests of the woman must predominate and that the government must needs remain silent.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","01:27 PM","abortion-debates","273"

"10-11-2008","3173",19,"Another opinion","327312","I place no importance on the fetus's ability to care for itself, to communicate, or to long-term survive, so your arguement here is irrelevant. What I do place most value on is what it is at that moment - is it a person or just a body with ""nobody home"". In early stages of pregnancy, it is just a body with ""nobody home"". Following along that comparison, if you are building a home, then it is not that bad if someone bombs it before there is anyone inside. Once there are people inside, then it is far worse to destroy it. And as for your last comment, once again, one cannot equate what WILL BE with what IS. Just because that body will someday develop into a person doesn't mean that it is a person NOW. Because of that potential, it deserves more respect and value than a blob of flesh, but certainly less than a person deserves. It is not a matter of definitions. It is a matter of analysing what we are at our core - what is the escence of us that we cannot do without. What we are at our core is our mental selves. Before we mentally exist, we don't exist - just our bodies. I have followed this line of reasoning for many years because it makes complete sense to me and since nobody has presented any arguements that refute that, outside of mere unsupported proclamations. I am quite happy and content with these views - no reservations, no guilt - because it makes most sense.","Archangel","327457","My argument isn't irrelevant just because you reject it Ao. All that means is that you reject it for no good reason. I would challenge you to prove that Ao, as I have explained why I believe a fertilized egg is alive and human from conception which you haven't even attempted to challenge with a rational response. REALLY? Is it not arson and a very serious crime to burn a house down whether it is occupied or not? If someone dies in that event, it brings an added charge of murder. But even empty, it's a serious crime to either burn or XXXX up an empty home. This paragraph is a completely subjective statement which isn't consistent with reality in the way the LAW deals with the unborn. If a woman who is just 4 or 6 weeks pregnant and is killed by a drunk driver, he is charged with killing 2 people. If she is murdered for any reason by an aggressor, he will be charged for killing 2 people, not just one. So it seems that the determination of whether the unborn have value or not legally speaking is based solely on whether its mother intends to keep it. And that my friend is a totally arbitrary and inconsistent standard by which to determine if the unborn are people or not. Regarding the bolded, I agree with you and submit that it is precisely what a fertilized egg is at its very core that proves that it is deserving of human rights and protections. And the evidence of that is over 6 BILLION human beings on Earth as we speak who all started out exactly where that egg is today and all 6 billion are now sentient beings just as you are within the very core of your being. If as a scientific mind, you require repeatable evidence to come to a conclusion, then how can you deny what a fertilized egg is in reality and still claim to have a grip on reality? You have 6+ BILLION copies of what an egg grows into as evidence of what we all are at that stage of life. How can you then say that these fertilized eggs are less than you are? Regarding the rest of the paragraph, again, prove it. Prove that a mental existence is required before respecting the person that unborn child will become if only allowed to mature through its gestation cycle. Who are you or anyone else to arbitrarily determine the time frame when an unborn child is worth allowing to live. What right does anyone have to decide that a growing fetus in its mothers womb is not a person due to its stage of development? It makes absolutely no sense to me at all that people can know exactly what that unborn child will become if allowed to grow for just 9 months, yet you have the hubris to determine that it isn't worthy of human rights.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","02:06 PM","abortion-debates","275"

"10-12-2008","3173",19,"gansao","327440","If a woman was say 2 weeks from term and she wanted to terminate then, would you still be in favour of her doing so?","Colonel Ingus","327565","For those following along, this question needs to be taken in context. If you just read a question like that you could easily be misled into thinking that the pregnancy was going along normally and out of the blue the woman wakes up one morning and says "" Oh, I think I'll have an abortion "". This is the stuff of the anti-choice movement's famous cartoons pretending that a ''baby'' right out of a Good Housekeeping ad is killed on the verge of live birth. Nothing could be further from the truth ! In reality, the fetus involved in late term abortions are often already brain-dead or otherwise hopelessly flawed , and the procedure protects the woman's health, including her ability to have children in the future. Late term abortions may also be used to remove a fetus that is already deceased , but they don't tell you that part in the anti-choice brochures. Anti-choicers try to scare people by making up non -medical words like 'partial birth abortion'. But even these kinds of mislabeled abortions are very, very rarely used. In-fact it's way less than 1%... not even a minuscule 1/4th of 1%... even less than 1/8th of 1% , - but anti-choicers make it sound like it's a common proceedure, when in-fact it is far from that. Only around 0.08% of abortions are performed after 24 weeks, and 71% of the women who had them did not even know that they were pregnant . The reality is that not all women deliberately wait to have their abortions, as some anti-choicers will have you try to believe. There are many very good medical reasons why a woman would not even be aware that she was pregnant. Some of these reasons are; women who menstruate irregularly or not at all due to illness, medication, or strenuous athletic activity; women who believe their absent periods reflect the onset of menopause; women with normally light periods, who mistake spotting that occurs in early pregnancy for menstruation; women who believe they cannot become pregnant because they are nursing babies or undergoing medical treatment; women whose pregnancies are initially -- sometimes repeatedly -- misdiagnosed by physicians or other practitioners. There are also other very good reasons why a woman might wait to have an abortion, like for example financial reasons. In one study of women who were having an abortion at 16 weeks, a substantial percentage of them said the delay occurred because they simply needed time to raise the money. Certainly in this bad economy we can all understand and relate to this. The simple fact of the matter is that almost 90% of abortions are performed in the very first trimester of pregnancy ( in the first 12 weeks after the first day of the last menstrual period ) and more than half of those are performed before 9 weeks . There are also some very good legitimate reasons for late term abortion besides the ones mentioned above, one is called Hydrocephalus , but the anti-choice movement doesn't want you to learn about it because it undercuts their argument, which is why they NEVER mention it before they preface a question like the one asked above. Hydrocephalus is when a fetus has abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the cavities of the brain. The fetuses head may expand to a abnormally large radius of up to 250% of a normal skull at birth, making it impossible for it to pass through the cervix. Eventually the pregnant woman would die without this late term procedure. The life of the mother should always take precedence. Not only that but because of the abnormally large amount of fluid accumulating in the fetuses skull, compression of the brain by the accumulating fluid eventually causes irreversible brain damage, and other life threatening complications for the fetus. As the hydrocephalus progresses, torpor ( a non-physiological state ) sets in. Around 90% of fetuses with spina bifida usually end up with Hydrocephalus. So as you can see when a late term abortion like this is used, it does NOT happen on a ""normal"" fetus. The fetus usually already has irreversible brain damage or is already dead . That's a LOT different than the cartoons used by the anti-choice movement where they try to trick you into thinking that the fetus was right out of a Good Housekeeping ad. Questions like the one above, when not kept in context, are nothing more than pure propaganda used to scare non-medical people into whipping up visions of torture on perfect fetuses, and nothing could be further from the truth! Late term abortions are RARELY ever performed, and when they are performed it is on abnormal fetuses and/or to save the woman's life.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","02:01 PM","abortion-debates","279"

This is not a kind of trick question. I am genuinely interested in your opinion!","Another opinion","327572","I don't place ABSOLUTE restrictions on any point in pregnancy. However, I would restrict abortions in the third trimester to a limited number of reasons - some of which are also agreed to by many on the pro-life side. These include: risk to mother's life, significant risk to mother's health, rape, incest, mercy killing (the fetus is severely deformed, etc.). Those are the ones that come most readily to mind. Indeed, as I have heard, the majority of abortions performed late term are already among those reasons. After all, a woman who even cares nothing about the late term fetus would herself not want to go through a late term abortion because of the health risks and because of the difficulty in getting someone to perform it. Nevertheless, even though the number of abortions performed for reasons that I would consider unjustified is quite small, I would still be open to the state introducting restrictions on late term abortions (as long as the restrictions did not introduce wording that could act as a slippery slope to outlaw all abortions). Indeed, the United Kingdom does restrict late term abortions - which has caused the abortion debate to quiet down compared to its previous state and the state it is in the US. Most of Europe has second and third trimester restrictions, but allows abortions in the first trimester.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","02:27 PM","abortion-debates","281"
