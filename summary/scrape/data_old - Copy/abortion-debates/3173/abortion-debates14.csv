See, it IS relative.","Phyllis","326798","No it is not. The fact that a difference of opinion exists does not mean every opinion is equally correct, or that none of the opinions, to the exclusion of all the others, is true. You skirted the issue again. I asked what you believe. I realize that you really are trying to avoid having to either admit that absolutes exist, or that your worldview will not allow you to see Hitler's genocide as being morally different from Wilberforce's liberation of the salves. But come on, show a little courage and answer this very simple question: Do you really believe that what Hitler did was just as moral as what Wilberforce did?

Did we support the wrong bloody tyrant in WWII? Is Stalin more immoral than Hitler, and what are the ""universal standards"" that you would use to judge? I will not take part in your silly Jesuitical word games. As to Hitler/Wilberforce, the answer still depends on whom you ask. If it were the family of people murdered at Auschwitz, then Hitler was a monster. If it were a Ukrainian whose family was starved by Stalin in the Great Famine of 1934, Hitler was an emancipator ala Wilberforce. See, there are no universals which control.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","11:30 AM","abortion-debates","198"

ZEF = parasite","Archangel","326983","What amazes me about this explanation is that you feel emboldened by these clinical definitions that are meant to explain the way the mother feeds her baby in the womb. But you use that information to relegate the human offspring to the level of a parasite which only exists in order to suck the life out of its host. Your rationale is both false and dishonest, unless you're actually simple enough to believe it, then you're just plain ole stupid. You are describing the only process of propagating the human species, and all species of animal life for that matter as if it is a type of disease which will ultimately kill its host. And yet, if that were the case then NO LIFE AT ALL WOULD EXIST ON EARTH ABOVE THE MICROBIAL LEVEL. So you can accuse me of relying on a Jr High Biology Text but it's you who has the most ignorant and simplistic interpretation of how life is created that I have ever read. LOLOL You are obviously not intelligent enough to separate the mechanism for growing a new life within the womb of a mammal from the end result of that process which is a living creature that is an equal reflection of the creature that carried it in her womb. Be she animal or human this cycle represents the process of how WE ALL GOT HERE TO THIS POINT OF COMMUNICATING ON THESE KEYBOARDS. How sad it is that you aren't smart enough to appreciate or grasp that reality. Now, a true parasite, as opposed to a parasitical relationship would be your original comparison to a tapeworm which no matter how long it survives within its host, it remains a parasite. And if allowed to grow perpetually could eventually kill its host. Where as a fetus grows into a human being in an established gestation period of 9 months time. See the difference Ingus? One is a true parasite while the other has a parasitical relationship which is totally natural and normal as proven by the existence of 6+ BILLION human beings on Earth today. So we know the process works more times than it fails. So my suggestion to you Ingus, is that you go back to 8th grade biology and start over again, and maybe this time you'll learn the difference between an unborn very healthy growing human fetus in its mothers womb, and a Tapeworm like parasite which will devour its host if allowed to grow unchecked. And while you're at it, take chester the thread molester, and penfold with you. They could use a taste of reality too.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","10:48 PM","abortion-debates","205"

As I learned in Law School, for every problem that exists, there is a solution that is obvious, simple, and wrong. The answer was, is, and always will remain, ""It depends on one's perspective.' Form the POV of one whose family was murdered at Auschwitz, Hitler was a monster. From the POV of a kulak or a Ukrainian enslaved by Stalin in the Great Famine of the 1930's, Hitler was the moral equivalent of Wilberforce, a liberator of slaves. Now, did the USA fight alongside the wrong bloody dictator in WWII. Since we knew then and know now that Stalin was a greater mass murderer by some order of magnitude than Hitler, would it have been more moral for the US to ally itself with Hitler to eliminate Stalin rather than the other way around? What absolute moral standards would you have used to judge and arrive at your choice? Similarly, how come the Taliban were Freedom Fighters when we armed them in their war against the USSR and how come now they are terrorists? Which moral judgment was correct then; which one is correct today? What absolute standards would you use to decide? By what absolute standard would you answer the metaphysical question of when personhood begins, and by what absolute standard would you impose one of the panoply of answers would you impose on people who believe differently from you?","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","05:48 AM","abortion-debates","209"
