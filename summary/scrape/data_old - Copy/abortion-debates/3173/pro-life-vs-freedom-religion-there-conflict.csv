So are you really positive you're not bringing god into this??? I guess it's impossible for anyone to prove that these opinions are not formed as a direct result of ""spiritual guidance"". There are plenty of differences between a foetus and a child, but that's another thread. So to avoid digressing further, I would wonder if there are any examples where there isn't this type of conflict in any type of legislation or moral judgement that is presented. You are virtually always going to be threatening the rights of an individual who doesn't agree with the views of a group that has the balance of power and is willing to use it. In terms of abortion, the reality is that there is no law forcing a religious person to have an abortion. But the churches have an intrinsic mandate to impose their views on others, regardless of the fact that abortions are simply available for the protection of women. The conflict is unavoidable!","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","12:59 AM","abortion-debates","8"

If I come up and slap you, are you gonna sit there and take it or are you gonna fight back somehow? It's not a ""right"", it's an instinct! You only say that so it wil fit nicely into your argument that a woman is only protecting HERself when having an abortion. HMMMMMMMMMMMMM, if I kill an intruder that was most likely going to harm my family, I would have a beer and celebrate over the dead body. One of you all said that an abortion can affect a woman for years...doesn't sound much like ""self-defense"" does it? Yes, during a time of war or in self defense. I cannot kill someone walking down the street just because I ASSUMED they would kill me, right? There has to be a reasonable expectation that your life was in danger in order to kill someone else. A fetus does NOT carry with it the GUARANTEE that it will kill the mother by so selfishly getting nutrients from her body and sharing blood and oxygen...the nerve of fetuses anyway, how dare they. Quite a stretch from the premise of self defense. May I ask, did the woman lay on her back against her will? I can't help but laugh at this silly notion that a woman is ""REQUIRED"", like mankind made some law to keep women suppressed or something. GEEEEEEEEZ, it's a biological function that you are equipped to do by God (OOOOOOOOOPS, bad word, sorry, I might get banned for THAT one). I'm not thrilled with the idea of having taste buds that force me to like some foods more than others, and therefore I may become fat because of it. Whichever politician that had the gaul to vote for people being required to have taste buds should be kicked out of office! LMAO get over it already","Sigma","68397","I fail to see how that matters :P I wasn't asking you to justify it; I was taking it as a given. I am not trying to say that abortion is self-defense... though in some cases it really is. I am saying that you believe your life to be more valuable than the intruders. The sanctity of your home is more important than the intruder's life . Your material possesions are more important than the intruder's life . I'm not saying you're wrong, in fact I agree with you. I am not against owning guns; you are assuming that of me. However, you are critical of people, saying oh how could you it's a life OMG YOU HEARTLESS BASTARDS when you would ""celebrate over the dead body"" of someone intruding your home. You value human life less than your material possessions, less than the sanctity of your home, so you are hypocritical to say what you say about pro-choicers. I would agree with you about the death penalty if it wasn't so damn expensive and didn't serve as a deterant. So you're against euthanasia I take it. It isn't GUARANTEED that someone intruding your home will harm you. It isn't assumed that a fetus is a detriment to a woman's health, it's pretty much established. That you would not allow abortion unless a death is guaranteed is sickening and careless of health hazards to women from pregnancy. That you would force motherhood is... I have no words. All it is to you is a consequence, not something that should be wanted . I never tried to tie in self defense, you assumed that. Your ""Do the crime, do the time"" argument is a horrible, horrible way of looking at it. Sex is not a crime, and motherhood should never, ever be treated as a punishment as you are doing. Motherhood should be desired, wanted. Every child born should be born because its mother wanted to have it . Your attitude needs some serious adjusting. When ""politicians"" make legal consequences to having an abortion, when they try and make continuing pregnancy a requirement by law, they are forcing women to continue their pregnancies. To believe otherwise is ignorant and shortsighted.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:59 PM","abortion-debates","27"

"09-24-2004","3173",2,"syklopps61","None","Well, not real sure why I'm pro-gun matters either, but anyway And I'm sure you value YOUR life than mine Obviously I have a very real and rational expectation that if they would break into my home to take something, they could be there to harm me as well. If I pull a gun on a cop, he's not gonna take the time to determine if I have bulletts.... I'd love to respond, but I wasn't sure where one thing ended, so could you clarify? AH, my way would be REAL cheap and very much a deterrent :-D You assume much LOL Honestly, I haven't given much thought to it. My first reaction is if the person if of sound mind then yes, it's okay. I will qualify that, by again stating that I haven't really weighed everything, so don't go trying to use that against me :-P No, true, but there IS a reasonable expectation that they will...see the cop analogy above My wife and I have ""selfishly"" had three and she seems pretty darn healthy to me :-D Would you want me up on murder charges if I killed someone who I just ASSUMED would kill me (NOT the intruder scenario please, talking about someone just walking down the street). There HAS to be a guarantee or a reasonable expectation to justifiable kill someone From this statement, it sounds like there should not be consequences to ANY actions then. When a life is involved, there is no FORCING involved, that's just a copout so a woman can behave like a man without any consequences. I'm sure you'd agree then that we should do away with deadbeat dad laws? I mean, he shouldn't have to face any consequences for his actions, right? Yep, guilty as charged, but there ARE those ""femi-nazi's"" out there who DO think that Who said anything about it being a punishment? what a sad way of looking at motherhood. Sex is not a crime, I'm all for it actually :-D, but murder IS, and murder should NOT be made less of a crime just out of convenience to the woman AAAAAHHHHHHH a perfect world WOULD be nice, wouldn't it? LOL LOL, why does MY attitude need serious adjusting? I'm defending an INNOCENT life here, and THAT'S a BAD thing? Man, we are living in Bizarro world now, scary No, it is simply putting innocent life above petty, selfish ""rights""","Sigma","68403","Because I have a point with asking. Do you have a point? I assume you mean that I value MY life more than YOURS, and you are correct. If I had to choose, you would die before me. The value of life varies person to person. They could . There is no guarantee , and that is your point, isn't it? There has to be a guarantee? Pulling a gun on a cop? When did cops enter into this? Ah, a blind spot where your hypocrisy is concerned, eh? When you are critical of people who are pro-choice, saying that we don't value human life you are being hypocritical. The value of human life varies to you, just as you accuse of pro-choice people. Bypassing due process of law isn't allowed Innocent until proven guilty and all that, and that's what is so expensive. Trials to prove guilt. Truly told, I could care less about it. If people want to kill themselves in this way why not. And there is a reasonable expectation that a pregnancy will be hard on a woman's body. There is a reasonable expectation that a woman will not be as healthy during the pregnancy. There is reasonable expectation that being pregnant is harmful to her health. There is reasonable expectation that it will harm her physically, emotionally, mentally or financially depending on the situation. Making broad comments and, more importantly, arbitrary laws that don't take into account specific situations is very irresponsible. Congratulations! Was she as healthy during the pregnancy as before and after? Was she able to do everything that she was able to do during as before and after? Pregnancy has effects on health, sometimes serious effects. If her health deteriorated, would you really support legislation that forced her to continue the pregnancy that was seriously and adversly affecting her health? If, heaven forbid, she was debilitated after the first pregnancy, recovered and accidently got pregnant again and told you she did not think she can face the health effects a second or third time, could you really support legislation that forced her to continue the pregnancy? ""someone walking down the street"" is not comparable to a fetus that is inside a woman, sharing her bodily resources and drawing nutrients out of her against her will and without her consent. It is much much more comparable to an intruder inside your home. It isn't ASSUMED that a fetus is sharing a woman's bodily resources and drawing nutrients out of her body, it's a fact. A fetus puts stress on a woman's body, sometimes a lot, sometimes enough to kill her, sometimes not so much. Every woman should have the right to not risk her health against her will . I personally believe that a man should be able to ""abort"" his rights and responsibilites when a woman is pregnant, but we aren't talking about anyone elses rights or responsibilites. We are talking about abortion. And in some cases, it is true. A fetus can indeed be a life-risk for a woman. A health risk is more frequent. I agree. Good thing abortion is not murder. You treat sex as a crime when you legislate consequences to it. Whatever ""natural"" consequences come from it come from it. Legal consequences are a different matter, and when you legislate motherhood as a consequence for sex you treat motherhood as a punishment. Then you won't mind me working toward that, eh? And I'm defending women so that they aren't required to be pregnant for your morals! Your attitude that ignores women's needs and desires needs adjusting. Putting an ""innocent life"" that has not been born over the life of women who have to bear that burden against their will. It's really disgusting.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","11:04 PM","abortion-debates","30"

I doubt that throughout history, the definition of murder falls much closer to how I defined it, more than the way YOU defined it.

"09-25-2004","3173",3,"syklopps61","None","C'mon, don't try to defend your assumption and then put others down for making their own! You EASILY could have made your point about killing an intruder whether or not I was ""pro-gun"", so don't get righteous with me Well IF you mean civilized people compared to the animals in the Middle East, then I would agree, but without an absolute in society it begins to decay. When we can all go around with our own set of rules, how can a society survive? Now, if you are juvenile and still have a problem with authority, then I guess you wouldn't agree with that statement. Anyway, I said this originally because I took your comment to mean that I was somehow a terrible person for valuing my life and the lives of my family more than that of someone breaking into my home I know I said a guarantee, but I also believe I had said if there is a reasonable expectation as well, so please don't take my words out of context in order to try to prove me wrong. It is REASONABLE to expect that someone committing such an act as breaking into my home, that they are there for a bad reason. I therefore, should not have to sit back and ask what his intentions are, I have the right to ASSUME he is there to do me harm. If you are saying that you are surprised that a cop would have the right to shoot you if you pull a gun on him, then you are more naive than I could have dreamed. Are you really telling me, that if you were a cop, you would wait for someone with a gun to raise it, point it at you and fire, before deciding that they are going to do you harm? Why do you assume that I was dodging your point? Are you that desperate to make one or win one? I didn't want to come right out and criticize the run on sentence, so I just asked you to clarify. IF you are referring to my celebrating over the death of someone who entered my home without permission, how do you come to the conclusion that I'm being hypocritical. Not everyone's life has the same value. People that commit illegal or evil acts against others have forfeited their ""right"" to be treated equally and to me the value of their life is greatly diminished. An innocent life, one that has done NOTHING evil or illegal, has the MOST value as far as I'm concerned, so yes, those innocent lives should be spared. I fail to see the hypocrisy (unless I was desperate to make a point of course, then it becomes obvious LOL) Who is claiming that pregnancy is easy? Have I ever said that? All I have said is that it is a normal biological process for which a woman's body is equipped to handle...if she couldn't, the human race would disappear. Does that mean that some women are unable to have a child safely? Of course not, I never said that EVERY woman on the planet has to lay on her back and spit one kid after another out of her. It is absolutley ridiculous to use this juvenile argument that because a baby obtains nutrients from the mother, and because this affects her health, FOR THE MOST PART DURING (SOME women might be affected afterward) her pregnancy, that somehow taking that innocent life is then justified is...just juvenile, not other polite way to put it. ROTFLAMO!!! Ya know what, when I have the flu, I can't do the things I could BEFORE I had the flu, SOMETIMES the flu kills people. Whya hasn't Congress looked into a law against the FLU? Don't they care about us, those bastards? Why do those of you who believe in killing innocent babies like to throw this in to the debate? It has been acknowledged by MOST people who are ""pro-life"" that if the mother's LIFE is in danger, then an abortion can be justified. You're going to throw it some few instances (like the whacked out chick in Texas who drowned her five kids) that the EVIL man just wanted to use her to spit out as many kids as possible with complete disregard for his wife's health..again, another desperate attempt to make a point Have you ever REALLY stopped to read and think about that statement? LMAO it really IS, without a doubt, THE silliest thing I've ever heard. The death of this country is putting EVERYTHING in legal terms. Then let me ask you, does the fetus CHOOSE to selfishly rob the mother of these nutrients? Oh wait, ignorance of the law is no defense, right? The fetus SHOULD know that it's actions are against the law, right? ROTFLMAO Man, you people think you have a winner of a point, and all I see are people with big clown shoes and orange hair trying to make it. You really don't know how silly you look hiding behind this ""argument"" My job puts stress on MY body, sometimes a lot, sometimes enough to kill people, sometimies not so much LOL I wish, JUST FOR ONCE, you people would just have the courage, without hiding behind silly arguments, to admit that all abortion is is a selfish act so that a woman does not have to be responsible for her actions (i.e., laying on her back with whoever she damn well pleases, afterall, a MAN can do it, so why can't WE, right?). Okay, now don't be disingenuous, you know as well as I do that that ""pig"" of a man that would leave a woman to face ALL the responsibilities by herself should be made to pay dearly. And for your information, the act of having an abortion when it is NOT medically necessary, is the act of someone running away from their responsibilities. IF in fact you really believe a man shouldn't be held responsible I guess I can at least say that you are consistent...and in Bizarro world yours would be a good thing. See, I believe a man SHOULD be responsible, and not ONLY financially...I also think the WOMAN should be responsible and have the child.. I TOO am consistent and I happen to live a place called REALITY Your credibility is GREATLY diminished when you make this statement, even if you only PARTIALLY agree with it. It ALMOST is as silly as the ""robbing nutrients""...maybe not LOL IN order for you to take actions that involve self defense, wouldn't you have to be taking actions against someon who is INTENTIONALLY trying to harm you? You are lying to yourself, it IS out of convenience and YOU know it deep down, but you know if you DO admit it then you have no other leg to stand on. GEEEEEZ, for so long the argument your side had was that the fetus WASN'T life, and since that has been totally blown out of the water you people have had to go to plan B, and you rely on the argument developed by some geeky little attorney or some femi-nazi who hates men. When I was growing up, when your story kept changing, it meant that you were lying...seems now in Bizarro world, it's okay to keep changing your story, if they don't buy this one, we'll keep trying another until they do. I believe the ""pro-life"" argument has remained pretty much the same over the years HUH? Pregnancy IS a natural consequence, isn't it? There is no LEGAL consequence to that. I get the feeling that you are very young, and I can accept blame on behalf of my generation for the way you think. When I was a kid and you did ANYTHING, you accepted the consequences that followed..you learned that there were other things that could happen as a result of my actions. My generation has screwed your mind up, making you believe that there is ALWAYS a way out, no matter what you've done. If you committed a crime, even a minor one, mommy and daddy spent big bucks on a lawyer so your ""good name"" would stay in tact. Now, if you want to interpret a woman not being allowed to commit murder out of convenience as something being a consequence that is legislated, then so be it. All it REALLY boils down to is if you are old enough to lay on your back and you know that pregnancy is a ""natural consequence"" then you have to take responsibility FOR your actions. I know that's not a concept that is recognized in Bizarro world...:-D May I ask you, if I have AIDS and spread the virus to other women, should there be legal consequences to my actions? I mean really, if so, you would be placing ""legal consequences"" on sex, wouldn't you? As long as it's not at the expense of innocent life, I could care less if you want to waste your time on a fruitless search No, you are fighting to allow women to do what they want with total disregard for anybody else ( It really is very simple, then don't lay on your back and put yourself in the position of getting pregnant! Despite what you think, I'm not some old fuddy duddy LOL There ARE other ways of enjoying sex, are there not? If you aren't aware of them, you might want to ask around LOL","Sigma","68509","I tied it in to being ""pro-gun"" because it shows you, in a way you can understand, that the value of human life is subjective depending on the circumstances you are in. Hopefully, it will put a stop to you crowing about how people who are pro-choice do not value human life. No, you are not a terrible person for valuing your life and the lives of your family more than someone breaking into your home. That is a perfectly understandable response that I would share. No clue why you brought up the Middle East. I agree. It is reasonable to think that a person breaking into your home will do you harm if you interfere with that person. It is not a guarantee. I'm not sure what your analogy is with the cop, or what your point is. It was not a run-on sentence. I over-use commas sometimes, but the sentence makes perfect sense if you say it right. You are being hypocritical when you blast pro-choice people, saying that we do not value human life when you yourself do not value the life of an intruder in your home and would in fact celebrate at his death. And this is just assuming he will do you harm. A fetus' rights to live (which it does not have, btw) does not supercede a woman's right to her own body. A fetus lives at the sufferance of the body it occupies. Then you are ignoring the hardships it puts on a woman's body? Why are you able to say to a woman I know its hard but you have to tough it out because I say so . It is a normal biological process that a woman may not want and is able to stop. An STD is a normal biological process for a virus. Your body becomes infected in a ""natural way"". You are allowed to stop it despite it being ""natural"". Not every woman is able to ""handle a pregnancy"" as easily as others. It is not up to you to decide if she still has to. It is up to the woman, and rightly so. It is justified because the fetus does not have the right to take nutrients against the mother's will and without her consent. Why is that hard to understand? And what do you do when you have the flu? Try to get rid of the damn thing don't ya?! I didn't say your wife's life was in danger. I said it debilitated her. She was weakened and in pain; her health was impaired. I said that she did not want to go through that again, that she did not think she could face how bad it made her feel. Do you support legislation that gives her no other choice but to continue with the pregnancy? How stupid is your comparing killing a random person on the street with the intensly personal and integrated nature of pregnancy? The fetus is not a stranger; it is a creature that is attached, drawing energy from the mother and dumping wastes into her system. It is literally living off of her body. This is more comparable to an intruder in your home than a random person on the street. eta, The fetus cannot choose anything, it has no concept of choice. Any and all choices for the fetus are done by the mother. Just because the fetus isn't intentionally harming its mother does not mean it is not harming its mother. Then quit. You can quit. You do not want to allow a woman to ""quit"" the pregnancy, despite any harm that comes to her short of killing her. I am not denying that an abortion is usually a selfish act. So is you killing an intruder. She values her life and her goals in life more than she values the fetus. She values her physical well-being, her emotional well-being, her mental well-being and her financial well-being more than she values the fetus inside of her. Is it wrong? Depends on who you ask. Should selfishness be illegal? You better lock up every single person ever born . I for one can not blame her for looking after herself first, and you are hypocritical when you do blame her for valuing herself more than another. wtf are you going on about? You have some real woman-issues you need to work out when you spout this drivel with no promptings. You continually ignore that abortion is a consequence. It is sometimes easier to face than pregnancy and motherhood which is why it happens. I can understand, since pregnancy and motherhood are life-changing events that should not happen because a woman has no other choice . I agree that men should be responsible, and so should women. However, I also believe that no-one should be a parent because they have no other choice. I strongly believe that every pregnancy and child should be wanted. Your way of forcing motherhood on unwilling people is not the way to do it, imo. Abortion is the responsible choice in some circumstances. Sometimes having a child is not a responsible thing to do. Then you deny that a pregnancy can sometimes kill a woman? It does not have to be intentional. If I am swinging a bat and unintentionally swing it toward you and you knock it out of my hand, are you acting in self-defense? Self-defense is just that, defending yourself from harm, intentional or otherwise. I don't lie, least of all to myself. At least, not intentionally Must have been a result of bad intel. eta, The story does not keep changing. There are just so many compelling reasons to keep abortion legal. Moral grounds, legal grounds, biologic grounds, medical grounds, in nearly every way you can think of there are compelling reasons to keep abortion legal or to allow abortions. Quite a rant. Getting older are we? Abortion is taking responsibility FOR your actions. It is a consequence. You don't like this particular choice, but you cannot deny that it is a possible consequence. Not taking responsibility is not thinking about the future, not thinking about how the pregnancy and childbirth will affect you and your future. In some cases, abortion is the responsible choice. You wish to make motherhood a legal consequence. Pregnancy is a possible consequence to sex, as you say a ""natural"" consequence. Abortion can be a consequence as well, depending on the woman involved and what decision she makes. You wish to make a legal consequence for becoming pregnant which is mandating motherhood. And you would be in favor of telling women to ""deal with it"" since she should have been more careful and really she consented when she had sex didn't she? STDs are a possible consequence for ""laying on her back"". Ah, such a pessimist. Negative, I wish to see that their rights aren't reduced in favor of what is growing inside them. Thank you, I know a bit about sex already I agree that people shouldn't put themselves into positions without thinking about what can happen. Unfortunately, they do. I still do not believe women should be punished for irresponsible behavior by being forced to gestate and give birth.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","11:48 PM","abortion-debates","35"

Using the word ""illegal killing"" is much more precise and the legality of the killing can be determined with other laws. Using the word ""person"" is pretty universal as well instead of ""human"" because then you get into sticky ""what exactly makes a human human"" type of debate. ""Person"" is able to be defined without getting into that type of debate.

Are you just ACTING stupid or.... LOL I was making an obvious analogy that killing in self defense is justified as long as there is a REASONABLE expectation that you will be harmed. It's unfortunate that I have to try to simplify things so it's easier for you to understand, and then it becomes too much for you to handle all at once Well, back in my day we knew how to write and had some knowledge of punctuation, sorry I wasn't raised with the lower standards of your generation Honey, I'd swim in his blood with orgasmic glee!!!!

LOL NOPE, I thought it was clear that I acknowledged the hardships...I'm not really sure I could've put it any more simple than I did All I'm saying is don't get pregnant because I said so :-P Just because one can stop it doesn't mean one should. I will repeat, if you don't want it, don't get pregnant in the first place..is that ALSO too hard to understand for you? Well, it's just silly and juvenile, so in THAT way it's hard to understand Well, TECHNICALLY speaking, you can't get rid of the flu, you can only try to prevent it, and IF you get it you have to endure it God help us...proof of the failure of the public school system. An obvious simple analogy to try to make it easy for you, I wasn't making a real comparison That you would not allow abortion unless a death is guaranteed is sickening and careless of health hazards to women from pregnancy. Would you want me up on murder charges if I killed someone who I just ASSUMED would kill me (NOT the intruder scenario please, talking about someone just walking down the street). There HAS to be a guarantee or a reasonable expectation to justifiable kill someone Okay, her's another SIMPLE analogy, okay? If I kill someone while drunk driving, I don't get the death penalty because it wasn't ""intentional"". So, why does the fetus, which you have acknowledged as being a life, have to have it's life ended, because it selfishly and unintentionally robs the mother of nutrients. Being a good Liberal, I'm sure to you that is an easy thing to do, but for those of us that understand responsibility, it's not that easy. And women that understand the concepts of sacrifice and responsibility willingly endure the hardships for the rewards that follow...but these are things you just can't grasp I will say unequivocally that it is DEAD wrong. I WILL judge you and everyone around me. It's not my job to judge your soul (or lack thereof LOL), but I can sure judge your behavior. There's no law against selfishness but maybe there should be,,,afterall, there IS a law against hate, right? And by the way, it most likely escaped you, but I'm joking (about the law for selfishness anyway, unfortunately you Libs have gotten your law against hate) Why do you immediately assume I have issues with women? Pretty sad tactic. Remember that simple rule..STOP...THINK? It's pretty obvious that I was spelling out what motivates people like you to so rabidly defend the taking of a life. The women's rights movement has brainwashed women into believing they can do everything a man can, and it doesn't stop with the professional world either. They want it with regard to sexual activity. Those dar babies get in the way of their sexual freedom, and THAT'S at least one of the reasons you fight to take an innocent life Anyway, too tired and bored to deal with the rest of this...maybe tomorrow :-D","Sigma","68603","er... whether or not it's an INNOCENT life, the value of a life changes depending on the circumstances you're in. Certainly they value the lives of their brethren more than they value the lives of Americans. But we were talking about that without cops That is why I didn't know why you suddenly brought up cops. Perhaps if you were clear to begin with you wouldn't have to ""simplify things"". I apologize. I will keep my sentence structures simple. ""Honey""? Are we married now? Haven't I said that I agree that a person would consider his or her family more important than an intruder? Why are you behaving like I said your family isn't important? er, ok. Ah, I see... And you are qualified to decide what those hardships justify why? This is a ridiculous pro-life argument. When we are talking about abortion, the woman is already pregnant . What are you are doing is saying that we should have closed the door after the man has escaped . Ok, yeah, we should have closed the door but what do we do now that he has escaped?! Your comment ignores the extremely varied circumstances that women find themselves in. However, whatever the circumstances of her getting pregnant whether it be getting drunk, smoking weed, getting raped, wanting a pregnancy then finding the situation is untenable, wanting a pregnancy and then losing a job, being physically threatened, emotionally abused, any number or any combination of these and other innumerable things, in the end she is still pregnant and we are arguing whether she should be allowed to have an abortion. Of course it doesn't mean one should. However, you cannot argue that it cannot be allowed because it's a ""natural biological process"". That is a really stupid argument. I agree that if you don't want it you shouldn't get pregnant. However, women still get pregnant and then don't want the pregnancy. Sometimes they get pregnant unintentionally, sometimes it is after they are pregnant that they discover that the situation is untenable. Whatever the reason, they are pregnant. Saying well they shouldn't have gotten pregnant ignores the problem. While with pregnancy you can get rid of it Good thing too, sometimes it isn't something a woman wants to endure. ... I said: Then you said: Obviously trying to compare killing someone just walking down the street to abortion. Do you practise being obtuse? Not because it ""selfishly and unintentionally robs the mother of nutrients"" but because the mother is not required to allow it to do that if she does not wish to share her body's resources. The drunk driver is not required to donate his or her kidney if the person they hit needs a kidney, even if he or she caused the accident intentionally or otherwise. (emphasis mine) And unwillingly? If the rewards that follow are not worth the pain now? Oh, I grasp them perfectly, but you undermine your own argument saying what you do. I have no problem with what you say here, I even agree with you to a certain extent. With many women, the pain and sacrifice they go through with pregnancy is rewarded with a child that they did all of this for. However, if the pregnancy is unwanted then the child that they will be presented with at the end is not worth the pain and sacrifice they are going through now . I don't believe in forcing them through that pain and sacrifice unwillingly. Agreed, it's hard to keep from judging people. I know that I can't help but judge you Yeah, hate crime laws are really ridiculous. Virtually all crimes against individuals are motivated at some levels by hate. Having a law against selfishness is the stupidest thing I've ever heard however. Thank goodness you're joking. When you're pulling **** like ""these women just want to act like men"" it makes me think you have some deep-seated issues with women who aren't demure and passive. I believe I told you exactly what is motivating me... and it has nothing to do with women's sexual desires. If you want to debate that, we'd have to start a new thread, but somehow I don't believe you will. Probably reveal too many skeletons in your closet :P Blah blah blah. Whether or not a woman wants to have a lot of sex outside of marriage or wants to have sex only with her husband has no bearing on my argument. Unplanned or unwanted pregnancies happen with any kind of couple or single parent. That you bring this up makes me think that you have some inner issue with women who want to have lots of sex.

Does that stop you from being confident that you aren't going to lose your job if your job is going well and there is no reason to believe you will lose it? I have just gotten a new job and I have little fear I will suddenly lose it (though it is indeed possible). There is no reasonable fear of losing my job. I would call my financial situation secure if I have no reasonable fear of losing my job and I have savings built up and I was putting money away every paycheck. At that point I would feel confident I could support a child with my SO. I still don't know what you are talking about saying that there is a ""reasonable chance one's finances will get better as well"". Over what time frame are you talking about? It probably won't suddenly get better over a pregnancy, and if one cannot support a pregnancy or child at the start, there is no reasonable belief that one can at the end. If you mean that over years one's income generally goes up then I would generally agree with you. However, that does not help a woman who is pregnant NOW and cannot afford it. Only if you get a significant raise or quit your job and start somewhere else that pays better. There is no guarantee of either, and betting my future on the hope that I can have either is not something I would do (unless I had a very good idea that I would be hired at the new place). Yes, tomorrow things could turn around. But I'm putting my faith on the trend of things, not sudden spikes and drops.

Of course you can lose your job without warning signs, but you cannot base every decision on the assumption that you will lose your job without warning.

The bottom line is the decision you make today can't be changed, so many things need to be considered, ESPECIALLY if, as you claim, abortion is such a life changing decision. If I knew that decision could devastate my life, I would choose the least devastating, wouldn't you? I would think that giving up the new fancy car would be worth not having years of mental anguish and psychotherapy, wouldn't you? I'll take this opportunity to relate a personal experience....back in 94 my wife was maybe a month pregnant when some whacko doctor prescribed some new drug for a urinary tract infection, even though my wife said she may be pregnant. Our OB/GYN never heard of the drug and had no studies to refer to. My wife had only taken one or two of the pills. Our doctor said that he could go ahead and perform an abortion if we had concerns about deformities or whatever else could have happened. We thought about it for a nano second and said no...today we have a beautiful, smart, funny daughter. If we had chosen to be selfish and think how a deformity could result in us not getting that nice house or car, we would have missed out on all the joy she has brought us. Well, considering that most who believe in the ""right to choose"" are typically Liberal, so it was a safe assumption. There DO need to be laws and morals though, and that IS a Conservative belief. Conservatives believe in personal RESPONSIBILITY, and in that sense getting rid of government interference. And you haven't asked to sacrifice, you have just decided on your own to sacrifice a life No question you should decide for yourself, I'm not saying that should be legislated (we've covered that before), except when it comes to another life, then your right no longer exists. I certainly have the right to say whatever I like, I just don't have the right to impose it on others. I can criticize and judge 'til the cows come home, I just can't take any actions to back it up Where did THAT come from? Are you then saying the only way to get ahead is to lay on your BACK? LOL I was referring to the different ways of having sex without getting pregnant, that's all Okay, I WILL grant you that, to your credit you have not once mentioned the government in taking care of a child.

And I DID go to college, but I never realized I used those big ""college"" words...my bad :-P With respect to this financial stuff, we can go round and round forever. The bottom line is the decision you make today can't be changed, so many things need to be considered, ESPECIALLY if, as you claim, abortion is such a life changing decision. If I knew that decision could devastate my life, I would choose the least devastating, wouldn't you? I would think that giving up the new fancy car would be worth not having years of mental anguish and psychotherapy, wouldn't you? I'll take this opportunity to relate a personal experience....back in 94 my wife was maybe a month pregnant when some whacko doctor prescribed some new drug for a urinary tract infection, even though my wife said she may be pregnant. Our OB/GYN never heard of the drug and had no studies to refer to. My wife had only taken one or two of the pills. Our doctor said that he could go ahead and perform an abortion if we had concerns about deformities or whatever else could have happened. We thought about it for a nano second and said no...today we have a beautiful, smart, funny daughter. If we had chosen to be selfish and think how a deformity could result in us not getting that nice house or car, we would have missed out on all the joy she has brought us. Well, considering that most who believe in the ""right to choose"" are typically Liberal, so it was a safe assumption. There DO need to be laws and morals though, and that IS a Conservative belief. Conservatives believe in personal RESPONSIBILITY, and in that sense getting rid of government interference. And you haven't asked to sacrifice, you have just decided on your own to sacrifice a life No question you should decide for yourself, I'm not saying that should be legislated (we've covered that before), except when it comes to another life, then your right no longer exists. I certainly have the right to say whatever I like, I just don't have the right to impose it on others. I can criticize and judge 'til the cows come home, I just can't take any actions to back it up Where did THAT come from? Are you then saying the only way to get ahead is to lay on your BACK? LOL I was referring to the different ways of having sex without getting pregnant, that's all Okay, I WILL grant you that, to your credit you have not once mentioned the government in taking care of a child.

Ooooh, the pain! lol, I hardly have enough for a fancy car. You're right, it is a life-changing decision as the decision to actually have a child is a life-changing decision. Either decision can devastate your life, and weighing both carefully would be very wise before making that decision. Sometimes choosing to have an abortion and not having a child is the least devastating. Just for the record, most women who have abortions do not need psychotherapy, and the mental anguish varies from woman to woman. Sometimes there is none. That's wonderful :D Do you mean that she decided not to take the pill for urinary tract infection? Those can be dangerous, and I applaud that both of you wanted a child enough to take that risk. I would never belittle the choice you made, as I would never belittle if you both had chosen to not have a child to take medication. My point has nothing to do with wanting to buy a car or house instead of a child, it's a matter of affording to have a child period. Still, whether or not I'm liberal is really meaningless. I believe there should be laws and morals as well, and in fact I am morally opposed to creating a law banning abortion. Personal responsibility, yes. I believe in that as well. I believe women should make responsible choices. I believe that abortion can be a responsible choice, and I believe women should be free to make that choice.

I simply disagree with banning it, personal beliefs nonewithstanding. Oh, I see. I didn't know what you meant by being on my knees. Heck, who says that I'm even a woman? Oh come now. You should be more intelligent than that. I never made that a criteria, or indeed even as an option. In fact, pro-life people should support gov't programs to help pregnant women to reduce the amount of abortions, since the majority of abortions are done for financial reasons (I believe...) Many programs aimed at helping pregnant women be able to afford children, such as WIC and others, are woefully underfunded and exclude many women. Adoption is only possible after the child is born. Some women cannot afford to be pregnant . Then, abortion is the only option to not have a fetus inside of her.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","10:23 AM","abortion-debates","105"

I would say my views on abortion are consistent with what our society is today. Agreed, no one can have things both ways (generally speaking). Abortion is a major decision, and the decision to have a child is also a major decision. Trying to judge which makes more of an impact on a woman's life has way too many variables to judge objectively. My own opinion is that having a child has more of an impact on a woman's life. No, I don't agree with this. I would say that most women are relieved after it is done, but I also believe it is almost always an big decision in a woman's life. It should not be done casually, and I don't believe it is done casually. Hardly something either of you can be blamed for, since you did not know it had harmful effects :P Nothing bad in the end though, so that's one good thing. I don't believe they are equivalent, really. They are both choices that are made during the pregnancy, but that's about it. I believe it is a wonderful thing that a woman feels she is ready for a child. I believe it is a sad thing that a woman feels she cannot care for a child. You risked a great deal of turmoil, and a woman who has an abortion risks nothing (generally). I agree that abortion can be and is usually selfish, and I think that sharing your life with a child is selfless (it has it's selfish aspect as well, but I believe in general it is selfless). I'm not a very judgmental person. I believe those who disagree with me are merely misguided and only must see things as I see them and they'd instantly understand what we must do. I'm a bit of an egomaniac, eh? They might find ways to afford a car if they must have a car, like I must have one to work and make money to support myself. A car generally has pretty predictable costs though, while with a child you're basically playing the lottery and hoping your kid has no major problems that will cost a lot of money. To me, a car is a lot less risky, especially since you can take it back if it has problems immediately, and get a warranty for farther down the road. A child provides nothing (materially, a child is usually a joy to parents) unlike a car and there are no guarantees in terms of health and costs. In terms of strict cost/benefits, I would go with the car. This is even without the costs of education thrown in when the kid goes to college. I have no numbers, but my feeling is that a child is more expensive in the long run, and in the short run if the kid has health problems. That by no means should be a deciding factor on having a child, however. A factor, sure, but that should not be the way you decide to have a kid. At least, it would not be with me. Oh, I think that getting pregnant when you are not ready to have a child is very irresponsible, for both parties. I also believe that a woman is beign responsible when she looks at her life and makes a decision, which could be that she is not ready to have and care for a child. It might be ""the easy way out"" and it is in some ways. I believe and abortion is an easier thing than carrying and then birthing it, but I also believe it is a responsible thing to do in some instances. Ah, well, I don't believe in devaluing the woman of the relationship by making the fetus more important. If she were my SO, I would value her life more than the fetus inside of her. That would indeed be logical. I am careful to say if I am pregnant, and if I am the husband. No need to apologize, I simply do not wish you to start making assumptions. Your sentence structure is a bit awkward here, so I'm not sure what you mean. Too many negatives to keep track of for me :P If gov't assistance is the sole criteria that I have for justifying abortion, then you are right that the same argument applies to everyone that is on gov't assistance.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","09:20 PM","abortion-debates","107"

Therefore, there would have to be a very good reason to supress that very important right. It is not enough for any life form to have human DNA or to even have the potential to become a full person just like us. The only thing that is important enough that would outweigh a woman's right to her own body is if the fetus is ALREADY close enough to being a person such as ourselves that it would gain rights that might overcome the right of a woman to her own body. For many people, including myself, the critical development that crosses this threshold is the development of a mental existence in the fetus. In other words, there has to be ""somebody home"" in that body, not just a developing body on its own, for us to start weighing in rights for that fetus that might overcome the rights of the woman to her own body.

But you use that information to relegate the human offspring to the level of a parasite which only exists in order to suck the life out of its host. Your rationale is both false and dishonest, unless you're actually simple enough to believe it, then you're just plain ole stupid. You are describing the only process of propagating the human species, and all species of animal life for that matter as if it is a type of disease which will ultimately kill its host. And yet, if that were the case then NO LIFE AT ALL WOULD EXIST ON EARTH ABOVE THE MICROBIAL LEVEL. So you can accuse me of relying on a Jr High Biology Text but it's you who has the most ignorant and simplistic interpretation of how life is created that I have ever read. LOLOL You are obviously not intelligent enough to separate the mechanism for growing a new life within the womb of a mammal from the end result of that process which is a living creature that is an equal reflection of the creature that carried it in her womb. Be she animal or human this cycle represents the process of how WE ALL GOT HERE TO THIS POINT OF COMMUNICATING ON THESE KEYBOARDS. How sad it is that you aren't smart enough to appreciate or grasp that reality. Now, a true parasite, as opposed to a parasitical relationship would be your original comparison to a tapeworm which no matter how long it survives within its host, it remains a parasite. And if allowed to grow perpetually could eventually kill its host. Where as a fetus grows into a human being in an established gestation period of 9 months time. See the difference Ingus? One is a true parasite while the other has a parasitical relationship which is totally natural and normal as proven by the existence of 6+ BILLION human beings on Earth today. So we know the process works more times than it fails. So my suggestion to you Ingus, is that you go back to 8th grade biology and start over again, and maybe this time you'll learn the difference between an unborn very healthy growing human fetus in its mothers womb, and a Tapeworm like parasite which will devour its host if allowed to grow unchecked.

Form the POV of one whose family was murdered at Auschwitz, Hitler was a monster. From the POV of a kulak or a Ukrainian enslaved by Stalin in the Great Famine of the 1930's, Hitler was the moral equivalent of Wilberforce, a liberator of slaves. Now, did the USA fight alongside the wrong bloody dictator in WWII. Since we knew then and know now that Stalin was a greater mass murderer by some order of magnitude than Hitler, would it have been more moral for the US to ally itself with Hitler to eliminate Stalin rather than the other way around? What absolute moral standards would you have used to judge and arrive at your choice? Similarly, how come the Taliban were Freedom Fighters when we armed them in their war against the USSR and how come now they are terrorists? Which moral judgment was correct then; which one is correct today? What absolute standards would you use to decide?

No where in that discussion was the issue of ""MORAL ABSOLUTES"" ever raised or discussed at all. POST 16 clarifies the point I was making very well. But again, morality wasn't the issue at all. Nor was I saying that there were no moral absolutes in this world or anywhere at all as that wasn't the subject being debated. [ Post 16 by Archangel ] Jo, we live in a world where there are exceptions to every rule for ONE reason or another. So your example doesn't conflict with my point at all. But my point stands and could be confirmed by polling every adoptive couple who seeks a baby in any given year. The vast majority of any race polled, to the tune of 99% I would wager, would say that if given their first preference, they would prefer a child of their own race. Of course, if that isn't possible due to the high number of abortions which limit the number of babies that are available, loving parents of any race will take babies of any race. My point isn't racist at all, it is acknowledging reality and the human nature which causes us to be drawn to those who look like we do. That is an inherent human characteristic that goes back to our very roots. You people are so blinded by modern day political correctness that you've lost the ability to be socially honest or objective. Note the bolded, it was this sentence which caused me to make the statement regarding no absolutes. And it is plain to see that it had nothing at all to do with moral absolutes.

Where moral absolutes are concerned, the problem, of course, is WHICH moral rules one chooses to be absolute. Different religions have different moral rules, all of whose proponents consider those absolute since they have trust that their religion reflects the truth. Similarly, 18th and 19th century discussions on natural rights often ran into the problem that philosophers (as well as politicians and laymen) disagreed on which rights would be considered absolute. Major problems are encountered if one tries to base ideas of moral absolutes on either religious belief or gut feeling. However, just because morality does not work in absolutes, that does not mean that there are no trends in people's moral beliefs. One trend that is VERY common is the idea that one should treat others as one would expect to be treated. It has many versions - ranging from the Golden Rule, to the phrase so often heard by parents telling their children ""How would YOU like it if that happened to you..."". Since our human experiences of physical and emotional suffering are similar, independent of the context, this would automatically lead to trends in moral rules - against murder, theft, etc. Most of the rest of moral judgement rests on value judgements, and these value judgements often depend on ones initial assumptions, on knowledge one has about the moral situation in question, on the traditions one was brought up with, etc. For example, a major value judgement that determines ones view on first trimester abortion rights is whether one places higher value on a woman's right to her own body (pro-choice) or on the life of a human body that will develop into a person but, up to that point, is merely a body (pro-life). Taking the example of the Holocaust or slavery, both of these situations were situations where large groups of people were caused significant suffering, where the imposition of that suffering was not necessary and was justified by illogical racist arguements (i.e. that Jews were evil, or that blacks were so mentally incapable that they needed to be governed through slavery).

But all of that is irrelevant to what is actually absolute morality in reality. The great flaw in peoples reasoning is that if they don't accept something as true, right, real or moral, then it doesn't exist to them. That type of thinking is self delusion. It's like atheists insisting there is no God. They are actually ignorant enough to believe that there is no God because they say there isn't one. None of which changes the fact that our Creator God is alive and well on Planet Earth and intimately involved with us and human history. So it is with morality, these simpletons can believe that the right to abortion is somehow absolute because it's the woman's body which carries the child, but that is just more self delusion no matter what the man made law say's. Because that unborn child is a developing HUMAN BEING which will surely grow into a sentient being if only allowed to complete the gestation period of 9 months. And the only rational and reasonable absolute choice the woman has in that situation is the control over her body not to have that unprotected sex, or sex at all if getting pregnant is going to be a problem for her. Once she gets pregnant, the choice of absolute control over her own body is long gone because NOW there is another totally innocent life in the equation, and that innocent life trumps her right to control over her body. THAT IS THE MORAL PERSPECTIVE WHICH THE CHESTERS, PENFOLDS, S&Ps AND INGUSES REFUSE TO ADMIT TO.

"10-09-2008","3173",15,"Another opinion","327041","I am happy for you that you should have the confort of feeling that sense of certainty. Most people don't. Most people need some level of evidence to be able to have certainty in a particular idea - be it religious or secular. Secular humanists will not believe in any view with any degree of confidence unless evidence exists. Most people are somewhere in between in that they take some level of a leap of faith, even without evidence. It is a minority of people that have strong confidence in belief despite evidence. Even the Bible aknowledges this doubt from lack of evidence as a problem and has a type of sympathy toward the disciple ""doubting Thomas"". The problem with moral absolutes is that many people claim to have the list of absolute moral rules, and these moral rules often differ greatly from each other (between different religions, between different natural rights philosophers, etc.). Your moral certainty seems to come from the spiritual enlightment you say you went through. Unfortunately, nobody can experience the spiritual enlightment that you went through for themselves and, since many others equally claim spiritual enlightment but with different conclusions, an outside observer could not tell which, if any, were true revelations. So, they have to go by evidence and reason. Nevertheless, one overlap between religious and secular moral philosophies is essentially the Golden Rule. That, at least, can be a starting point of moral discussions to try to reach a consensus. There are various value judgements that happen during a pregnancy and decision whether or not to abort. The side of a choice for abortion might include: - The negative consequences of giving birth to and bringing up a child in adverse circumstances (which could include a woman never getting the chance to then have an education to get out of poverty, could include forcing her existing family into poverty by having ""too many mouths to feed"", etc.). - The negative consequences of giving birth to and adopting out a child, where many women feel a lifelong guilt about adopting out their child, which is understandable since (though many people are supportive) most people in society find it hard to imagine how anyone can give up a child. - The anger at feeling that ones rights are infringed upon when on is forced to carry a child against ones will. - Dire circumstances of rape, incest, major risk to health or life, etc. The side of a choice against abortion might include: - Religious beliefs about the sanctity of life at all stages. - Aknowledgement that the early fetus will, if left alone, become a person like one of us which translates into a value of that potential. - Recognition that, in late term, the fetus might ALREADY have emotions, thoughts, the ability to suffer and feel pain, etc. There are values on both sides that are balanced. For the most part, I agree with pro-choice advocates that the mother is in the best position to decide - especially since it is HER body we are talking about. However, in late term, I would agree that TWO people are now involved, not just one, so the state has some right to get involved and make its own value judgements. Addressing a different point you made, when women have sex, they know that they risk pregnancy but that doesn't mean that they are agreeing that, if they become pregnant, they will carry the pregnancy to term. If one is walking in a bad neighborhood, one knows that one risks getting mugged. That doesn't mean that one agrees to be mugged.","Archangel","327069","You're ignoring the fact that it matters not in reality what they don't believe is real or true, because it doesn't change what is real or true in any way, shape or form. Truth surpasses all human understanding and even though I claim to understand the absolute scriptural morality of the bible, neither I nor any human being can fully grasp or appreciate the fullness of Gods truths. I just happen to understand that absolute morality exists at all which is more than most secular humanists believe which has been asserted by chester on multiple occasions here. Again, I know this is what they argue. Without evidence they are free to ignore absolute truths. But that ignorance of the absolute in no way nullifies it or negates its ultimate result as absolute truth. It's like the law say's that ignorance is no excuse for breaking the law. So it is with the eternal truths which are as real as the physical laws which secular humanists accept as real and undeniable. Actually millions upon millions of believers in Christ have had similar experiences to mine which proved to them that they are not alone in this life. I am definitely not alone in my personal experiences. Only my experiences are unique as they specifically apply to me, but many have experienced similar events that proved to them that both God and absolute spiritual truths are as real as the physical laws which guide Gods Creation. Actually, the Golden Rule is taken directly from the bible, but has been adopted and applied by secularists, as have most every single moral principle by which humanity lives by in order to maintain an orderly Society. The only aspect of Gods moral principles which is being erased from Society today is God Himself are atheists and secularists who desire to elevate MAN to the position of our own moral guides. This of course is leading to a society of amoral and narcissistic hedonists who believe that if it feels right to that person, then it must be ok to do it. Then adopt it out! Are you actually arguing that the guilt of adopting out a healthy child is greater than knowing she killed her own child in the womb, thereby denying it any life at all? I need evidence that such a scenario is rational, much less likely. You mean the anger of being forced to be responsible for their own actions? Do you feel sympathy for the murderer who is sorry they got caught and are facing the legal consequences for their crime? I have never argued against the validity of abortion under certain extreme circumstances. This is changing the goal posts for the sake of this debate. You're just stating the obvious here. Again, the moral issue you are ignoring is that it is no longer her body which she is responsible for. It is now an unborn child which will surely grow into a sentient being if allowed to grow which is inside of her. You are arguing a false point since we all know that from the point of the egg being fertilized, it is inevitable that if allowed to complete the gestation cycle, it will result in the birth of a child wich carries the combined genetic features of both parents. To deny that is to deny the reality of what is growing in her womb. Irrelevant! they have the responsibility, along with their partner to be responsible only over their own bodies. Once a child is conceived, they have no right to end its life for the sake of their own personal convenience when that choice ends the life of an innocent bystander which the child is since it played no active part in its own conception. You are no different than the other pro abortion apologists when you seek to force that innocent child to pay the ultimate price for their irresponsibility.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","01:47 PM","abortion-debates","221"

Oedema is common, especially in the legs. Many women get an obstruction of the intestine during a their pregnancy, which can be very serious. The obstruction can easily lead to gangrene of the intestine and peritonitis. The pregnant woman's body goes through many changes to provide whatever the ZEF needs to grow.

Also, the expectant mother's blood vessels widen, and the volume of water and salt increases in her body causes further health damage to the woman. And of course we're not forgetting that the simple act of being pregnant puts the woman in the highest rate for homicide . Other issues that can develop are Hyperemesis Gravidarum, Eclampsia, Rh Incompatibility, Preeclampsia, Gestational Diabetes, Peripartum Cardiomyopathy, as well as severe Liver damage. We haven't even started to talk about all of the permanent nerve damage, or all of the skeletal damages to the spinal cord and/or knee cartilage that could cripple a woman for the rest of her life because of the pregnancy. And this is all just a partial list of how a fetus damages a woman's body. Now if anyone was to walk up to you and did bodily damage of any kind to you, it would be listed under an assault . That's EXACTLY what the fetus is doing, it's harming and assaulting the woman's body. Far from being ""innocent""","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","06:10 PM","abortion-debates","228"

If unborn babies are dangerous parasites as Ingus, penfold, chester and shooter all claim, then as we humans always do, we should fix this problem. And you rightly focused right in on the source of the problem by singling out the male testicles as the organs which produce the invasive microbes, which once implanted into the poor unsuspecting female, is victimized by the completely unexpected growth of this foreign parasite that attempts to take over her body in such a violent and invasive way. From that point of view, one must thank God for the abortion procedure. And if true, then not enough of them take place in reality. If ZEFs are in fact true parasites, then they all should be forcibly removed from the women who's bodies they have invaded. So what to do is the question. How do we avoid this infection from continuing in the females of the human race? The only real solution seems to be full on castration of every male child. And it seems to me that due to the trauma of such an invasive operation, such an operation should be performed at the same time as boys foreskins are removed for sanitary purposes immediately after birth. Of course, the result of such a move if enforced on an International scale would lead to the complete extinction of the human race within one generation, but hey, we would also rid the world of those pesky parasites which invade the females of our species on such a regular basis. How's that for a solution LEFTISTS? Is that a solution you could support? And you would kill 2 birds with one stone as this ridiculous debate about abortions would also disappear all together. Please respond to this suggestion and tell me how you would vote on such an amendment. Maybe for once, we can actually come to a positive conclusion on one of these debates and agree on a universal solution which everyone can live with; or die with.

The method for justification requires that they dehumanize the unborn children which is why they will refer to them as ZEFs and Zygotes. And is why they will use comparisons to the fertilized and unfertilized chicken egg, which we eat for breakfast. You see, either way, when debating this issue on such a simplistic level, they win by default because they have already lowered the standard of debate to that of a chicken egg. So, by just understanding the shallowness of their tactics, we win by not allowing them to dehumanize our human offspring to the status of an inhuman analogy. Remember that these people are attempting to justify the murder of our very own human offspring. And they know that as well as you and I do. What they must do is both justify their stance and maintain a clear conscience so they don't have to live with the guilt that they are in fact defenders of a pro murder philosophy. That is why no matter what common sense arguments you use with them, no matter how obvious and rational your reasoning, they will never accept or concede that their position is not only false and irrational, but is criminal and a pro-death philosophy which supports and encourages genocide. After all, it is painfully obvious that any doctrine which not only allows, but enables the killing of 1.4 million members of one particular class of American consistently, year after year can be described as nothing other than genocide. That is why they must dehumanize the unborn, because they don't want to admit that they are proponents of the Great American Genocide. So forgive them for their irrational debating style which results in them offering the most infantile and ignorant arguments in their attempts to justify their sociopathic and shortsighted gospel of death and destruction of our most innocent and silent demographic, who have no personal voice of their own with which to defend themselves. What better a group to victimize than the absolute weakest among us? And they are even out of sight, so also out of mind of the masses. If they can only be dehumanized, then justifying their extermination should be easy according to the proponents of this MULTI BILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL INDUSTRY. So by understanding the rationale of these opponents of life for the unborn, you are more prepared to deal with the ignorance and shallowness of their inane attempts to justify such human carnage on such a massive scale. Just understand that these proponents of ABORTION are also victims since they have been raised in a selfish and self centered Society to believe that personal responsibility is a thing of the past, so demanding that the innocent child pay with its very life, the price for the sins of its mother/parents is just fine. And if they can moralize it by dehumanizing the baby so they can feel as though it is justified, then all the better.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","02:07 PM","abortion-debates","253"

A fetus is created in the body and expelled through a tube between the legs , so is a turd! How seroiusly would you consider this theory?","Another opinion","327323","Here, I was trying to differentiate between the way a term (in this case, parasite) is officially defined compared to the way it is commonly used. The official definition of parasite is (from the Myrriam-Webster online dictionary): 1 : a person who exploits the hospitality of the rich and earns welcome by flattery 2 : an organism living in, with, or on another organism in parasitism 3 : something that resembles a biological parasite in dependence on something else for existence or support without making a useful or adequate return Technically, one might classify the fetus as a parasite in this case since it does seem to fit definitions 2 and/or 3 - ex. that it is indeed a living organism living in another organism. So, I would agree with those here who argue that technically it fits the definition. However, we all know that there are various automatically assumed meanings that get attached to words and, therefore, using the term ""parasite"" for a fetus is quite misleading. Every other instance of the use of the term parasite (at least that I have ever heard mentioned) carries all of the connotations listed in my earlier post - connotations that do not apply to the embryo/fetus. So, once again, calling a fetus a parasite might be technically correct but practically misleading - so I would object to calling it a parasite.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","05:43 PM","abortion-debates","265"

I usually get the words right but not necessarily in the correct order( missed that lesson apparently). In fact the dictionary that I own is the Oxford English dictionary printed by the Oxford university press( An English dictionary printed in England by one of the two major seats of learning in the country..beat that!) Parasite..1 an organism living in or on another and benefiting at the expense of the other. If the fetus is an organism living in or on another organism then by definition is a seperate entity from the host( mother) therefore abortion amounts to killing another seperate creature, we just cant have that , the pro choice cannot accept that.Also if a mother exclusively suckles her baby by this definition the baby will be a parasite long after it is born. benefitting at the expense of the of the other...well they do that long after birth. This would make them a parasite up to the point that they leave home...so obviously that would be nonsense . Comparing your strapping 16 year old with a tape worm is silly..lacking sense, foolish,imprudent, unwise ( Oxford English dictionary) However definition no 2( there are only 2 and as this is the Oxford English dictionary so there ARE only 2, no arguing!) is a person who lives off or exploits another or others ..so there we have it despite my lack of education I have solved the problem..it is not the fetus that is the parasite it the teenager.

"10-11-2008","3173",19,"Another opinion","327312","I place no importance on the fetus's ability to care for itself, to communicate, or to long-term survive, so your arguement here is irrelevant. What I do place most value on is what it is at that moment - is it a person or just a body with ""nobody home"". In early stages of pregnancy, it is just a body with ""nobody home"". Following along that comparison, if you are building a home, then it is not that bad if someone bombs it before there is anyone inside. Once there are people inside, then it is far worse to destroy it. And as for your last comment, once again, one cannot equate what WILL BE with what IS. Just because that body will someday develop into a person doesn't mean that it is a person NOW. Because of that potential, it deserves more respect and value than a blob of flesh, but certainly less than a person deserves. It is not a matter of definitions. It is a matter of analysing what we are at our core - what is the escence of us that we cannot do without. What we are at our core is our mental selves. Before we mentally exist, we don't exist - just our bodies. I have followed this line of reasoning for many years because it makes complete sense to me and since nobody has presented any arguements that refute that, outside of mere unsupported proclamations. I am quite happy and content with these views - no reservations, no guilt - because it makes most sense.","Archangel","327457","My argument isn't irrelevant just because you reject it Ao. All that means is that you reject it for no good reason. I would challenge you to prove that Ao, as I have explained why I believe a fertilized egg is alive and human from conception which you haven't even attempted to challenge with a rational response. REALLY? Is it not arson and a very serious crime to burn a house down whether it is occupied or not? If someone dies in that event, it brings an added charge of murder. But even empty, it's a serious crime to either burn or XXXX up an empty home. This paragraph is a completely subjective statement which isn't consistent with reality in the way the LAW deals with the unborn. If a woman who is just 4 or 6 weeks pregnant and is killed by a drunk driver, he is charged with killing 2 people. If she is murdered for any reason by an aggressor, he will be charged for killing 2 people, not just one. So it seems that the determination of whether the unborn have value or not legally speaking is based solely on whether its mother intends to keep it. And that my friend is a totally arbitrary and inconsistent standard by which to determine if the unborn are people or not. Regarding the bolded, I agree with you and submit that it is precisely what a fertilized egg is at its very core that proves that it is deserving of human rights and protections. And the evidence of that is over 6 BILLION human beings on Earth as we speak who all started out exactly where that egg is today and all 6 billion are now sentient beings just as you are within the very core of your being. If as a scientific mind, you require repeatable evidence to come to a conclusion, then how can you deny what a fertilized egg is in reality and still claim to have a grip on reality? You have 6+ BILLION copies of what an egg grows into as evidence of what we all are at that stage of life. How can you then say that these fertilized eggs are less than you are? Regarding the rest of the paragraph, again, prove it. Prove that a mental existence is required before respecting the person that unborn child will become if only allowed to mature through its gestation cycle. Who are you or anyone else to arbitrarily determine the time frame when an unborn child is worth allowing to live. What right does anyone have to decide that a growing fetus in its mothers womb is not a person due to its stage of development? It makes absolutely no sense to me at all that people can know exactly what that unborn child will become if allowed to grow for just 9 months, yet you have the hubris to determine that it isn't worthy of human rights.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","02:06 PM","abortion-debates","275"

If you just read a question like that you could easily be misled into thinking that the pregnancy was going along normally and out of the blue the woman wakes up one morning and says "" Oh, I think I'll have an abortion "". This is the stuff of the anti-choice movement's famous cartoons pretending that a ''baby'' right out of a Good Housekeeping ad is killed on the verge of live birth. Nothing could be further from the truth ! In reality, the fetus involved in late term abortions are often already brain-dead or otherwise hopelessly flawed , and the procedure protects the woman's health, including her ability to have children in the future. Late term abortions may also be used to remove a fetus that is already deceased , but they don't tell you that part in the anti-choice brochures. Anti-choicers try to scare people by making up non -medical words like 'partial birth abortion'. But even these kinds of mislabeled abortions are very, very rarely used. In-fact it's way less than 1%... not even a minuscule 1/4th of 1%... even less than 1/8th of 1% , - but anti-choicers make it sound like it's a common proceedure, when in-fact it is far from that. Only around 0.08% of abortions are performed after 24 weeks, and 71% of the women who had them did not even know that they were pregnant . The reality is that not all women deliberately wait to have their abortions, as some anti-choicers will have you try to believe. There are many very good medical reasons why a woman would not even be aware that she was pregnant. Some of these reasons are; women who menstruate irregularly or not at all due to illness, medication, or strenuous athletic activity; women who believe their absent periods reflect the onset of menopause; women with normally light periods, who mistake spotting that occurs in early pregnancy for menstruation; women who believe they cannot become pregnant because they are nursing babies or undergoing medical treatment; women whose pregnancies are initially -- sometimes repeatedly -- misdiagnosed by physicians or other practitioners. There are also other very good reasons why a woman might wait to have an abortion, like for example financial reasons. In one study of women who were having an abortion at 16 weeks, a substantial percentage of them said the delay occurred because they simply needed time to raise the money. Certainly in this bad economy we can all understand and relate to this. The simple fact of the matter is that almost 90% of abortions are performed in the very first trimester of pregnancy ( in the first 12 weeks after the first day of the last menstrual period ) and more than half of those are performed before 9 weeks . There are also some very good legitimate reasons for late term abortion besides the ones mentioned above, one is called Hydrocephalus , but the anti-choice movement doesn't want you to learn about it because it undercuts their argument, which is why they NEVER mention it before they preface a question like the one asked above. Hydrocephalus is when a fetus has abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the cavities of the brain. The fetuses head may expand to a abnormally large radius of up to 250% of a normal skull at birth, making it impossible for it to pass through the cervix. Eventually the pregnant woman would die without this late term procedure. The life of the mother should always take precedence. Not only that but because of the abnormally large amount of fluid accumulating in the fetuses skull, compression of the brain by the accumulating fluid eventually causes irreversible brain damage, and other life threatening complications for the fetus. As the hydrocephalus progresses, torpor ( a non-physiological state ) sets in. Around 90% of fetuses with spina bifida usually end up with Hydrocephalus. So as you can see when a late term abortion like this is used, it does NOT happen on a ""normal"" fetus. The fetus usually already has irreversible brain damage or is already dead . That's a LOT different than the cartoons used by the anti-choice movement where they try to trick you into thinking that the fetus was right out of a Good Housekeeping ad. Questions like the one above, when not kept in context, are nothing more than pure propaganda used to scare non-medical people into whipping up visions of torture on perfect fetuses, and nothing could be further from the truth!

These include: risk to mother's life, significant risk to mother's health, rape, incest, mercy killing (the fetus is severely deformed, etc.). Those are the ones that come most readily to mind. Indeed, as I have heard, the majority of abortions performed late term are already among those reasons. After all, a woman who even cares nothing about the late term fetus would herself not want to go through a late term abortion because of the health risks and because of the difficulty in getting someone to perform it. Nevertheless, even though the number of abortions performed for reasons that I would consider unjustified is quite small, I would still be open to the state introducting restrictions on late term abortions (as long as the restrictions did not introduce wording that could act as a slippery slope to outlaw all abortions). Indeed, the United Kingdom does restrict late term abortions - which has caused the abortion debate to quiet down compared to its previous state and the state it is in the US. Most of Europe has second and third trimester restrictions, but allows abortions in the first trimester.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","02:27 PM","abortion-debates","281"

There is nothing wrong with you asking a question. That is what forums are for, to ask questions and to learn, but like most of your statements your question was misleading . Someone could read it and think that it is the womans choice to have a late term abortion, and that is not true. More times then not it is the DOCTOR that brings the subject up, and many times they do it to save the womans life . Imagine that","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","03:01 PM","abortion-debates","283"

The previous poster and the person to whom the question was directed too knew exactly what the question was and what was required to answer it.
