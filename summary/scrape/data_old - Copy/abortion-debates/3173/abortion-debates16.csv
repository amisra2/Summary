In the real world, the question of personhood is purely metaphysical, permitting of no answer, let alone no absolute answer, except the one formed by each individual based upon her/his values, morals, and experiences. Speaking of absolute morality, is the woman who escaped with others from Bergen-Belsen a murderer is she smothers her crying infant in order to save the rest from being discovered? How can anyone possibly say there is a single answer to that question. Second scenario: A group of children is playing on a railroad track. Unbeknownst to them, a rail car has broken loose and is hurtling toward them. You have the power to turn a switch that will divert the car onto another track. The problem is that, by so doing, the car will hit a homeless person sleeping between the rails (BTW, it is a commonly held belief among tramps that a snake will not cross a track.). Murder or not? Who decides? How? Sorry, but the absolutists provide us with no guidance whatsoever.","Archangel","327097","You truly embarrass yourself chester. Either that or you are the most dishonest person I have ever debated. You know darn well that 99% of every fertilized egg will grow into a perfectly healthy sentient human being if only allowed to grow for 9 months unhindered. To then attempt to dehumanize it for the sake of killing it is a double tragedy and twice the crime, since that child has first been dehumanized and then murdered. Only a scoundrel and a philosophical coward would claim that there is no absolute answer as to what every single pregnant woman is carrying within her womb when #1, you know very well through your own personal life experience that you were once exactly what the fetuses you so easily argue to kill is, and #2 with 6+ BILLION human beings on Earth, and that every single one of them went through the same process to get here, that what is growing in every womans womb is exactly what you are, only more so. By that I mean that they are true human beings with souls and brains, characteristics I am starting to doubt you possess. That's actually an easy question to answer as tragic as the outcome. She would be right in smothering the baby in such a circumstance if it saved the lives of other people who also deserve to live. Sacrificing one in order to save the many is no hard choice for a realist. For bleeding heart liberals who lack all rational thought processes, the simplest moral question is a mind boggler. Again, you embarrass yourself to such a degree that even I feel sorry for you. You know the switch bar that diverts the track? I would use that, or a rock to bang on the track knowing the sound would travel down the track and when the kids looked my way, I would point to the train thereby warning them off the tracks. And why am I not surprised that you would know the superstitions of hobos? My question is, how did you afford a computer?","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","04:54 PM","abortion-debates","226"
"10-09-2008","3173",16,"Archangel","327036","And the only rational and reasonable absolute choice the woman has in that situation is the control over her body not to have that unprotected sex, or sex at all if getting pregnant is going to be a problem for her. Once she gets pregnant, the choice of absolute control over her own body is long gone because NOW there is another totally innocent life in the equation, and that innocent life trumps her right to control over her body. THAT IS THE MORAL PERSPECTIVE WHICH THE CHESTERS, PENFOLDS, S&Ps AND INGUSES REFUSE TO ADMIT TO. And that is because they have no moral center beyond there own very shallow personal opinions.","chester","327101","A picture is beginning at long last to emerge here, and it's not a very pleasant one. Apparently Archie feels that pregnancy is just punishment for a woman who expresses her sexuality. Well, since the pregnancy is clearly not the result of the Immaculate Conception, one cannot help but wonder what words of wisdom Archie might have for men. It's OK if he wnts to believe that; it's also OK if he wants to impose that warped value on the women in his family. Mind this well - - I have three daughters of child bearing age and one granddaughter who soon will be. You have no right to impose that warped, reprobate value system on any of them. They are women with brains, and they are perfectly capable of choosing whatever course of action they will, some creature named Archie notwithstanding.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","05:12 PM","abortion-debates","227"
"10-09-2008","3173",16,"Archangel","327092","I mean, exactly what crime has an unborn child in the womb had the opportunity to commit","Colonel Ingus","327109","Are you really THAT ignorant on this topic? For the most part every ZEF damages a woman's body during pregnancy. For example; I know women that suffered kidney damage. In fact kidney damage is quite common, and the risk of kidney failure increases significantly during pregnancy. Intrauterine infections are also common, as is blood clots and thromboembolic disease. Oedema is common, especially in the legs. Many women get an obstruction of the intestine during a their pregnancy, which can be very serious. The obstruction can easily lead to gangrene of the intestine and peritonitis. The pregnant woman's body goes through many changes to provide whatever the ZEF needs to grow. It does all of this at the woman's expense , just the same as any other parasite would harm its host, so does the fetus. Also, the expectant mother's blood vessels widen, and the volume of water and salt increases in her body causes further health damage to the woman. And of course we're not forgetting that the simple act of being pregnant puts the woman in the highest rate for homicide . Other issues that can develop are Hyperemesis Gravidarum, Eclampsia, Rh Incompatibility, Preeclampsia, Gestational Diabetes, Peripartum Cardiomyopathy, as well as severe Liver damage. We haven't even started to talk about all of the permanent nerve damage, or all of the skeletal damages to the spinal cord and/or knee cartilage that could cripple a woman for the rest of her life because of the pregnancy. And this is all just a partial list of how a fetus damages a woman's body. Now if anyone was to walk up to you and did bodily damage of any kind to you, it would be listed under an assault . That's EXACTLY what the fetus is doing, it's harming and assaulting the woman's body. Far from being ""innocent""","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","06:10 PM","abortion-debates","228"

You see, my father was one for three years during the Depression, until FDR's New Deal rescued him and sent him to work in CCC camps planting trees in National Forests and elsewhere. Do you know the difference between a hobo, a tramp, and a bum? My father was a proud hobo, and I respect him for it to this day.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","07:19 PM","abortion-debates","229"
"10-09-2008","3173",16,"Archangel","326987","Why is it that all of you lefty's interpret the truth as a flame war? And who are you to determine what is flaming and what isn't? Are you some authority here that we should know about? Who are you suggesting is fighting the definition of a parasite? Are you unable to comprehend what I wrote? Or tell the difference between how a fetus is fed and what a true parasite is? Read my post again very carefully, and you will hopefully grasp what I said. If not, that's ok cuz my post speaks for itself. I even bolded the relevant part that most clearly summarizes it for you. Hopefully, that will help you understand the difference between a parasite and a fetus. As for the dictionary defining a ZEF as a parasite, feel free to post that definition, WITH A LINK, just to support your claim.","Shooterandproud","327116","Just giving my honest opinion. Its not what you're saying its how you're saying it. It doesn't matter what your opinion on what is a parasite and what is not. The English language classifies the ZEF as a parasite. Period. There is not much debating that. If you insist: Parasite: An organism that lives in or on and takes its nourishment from another organism. A parasite cannot live independently. The term ""parasite"" came from the Greek ""parasitos"" (para-, along side of + sitos, food) meaning ""eating at the side of, as at the same table."" The sense of the term later changed to that of a poor friend or relative who lived at the expense of another. Not until the 18th century did ""parasite"" come into English as a biologic term. http://www.medterms.com/script/main/...rticlekey=4769","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","07:24 PM","abortion-debates","230"

I didn't think so. Your tunnel vision is showing again. Sure there is. Your opinion means nothing with me so prove a so called ZEF is a parasite as defined in a dictionary! You made the claim, now back it up. Hey, shooter, you have defined a parasite, not a ZEF. No where in your definition does it classify a human embryonic offspring or a fetus as a parasite. Nor did it mention an unborn human fetus as a parasite. So let's be as clinical and accurate as you mental midgets like to claim you are. Define a ZEF and show where it is referred to as a parasite that sucks the life out of its host and will eventually kill it if left to grow to term as true parasites will do if allowed to grow unchecked. I've got some news for you though, you're wasting your time because just because you've swallowed pro abortion propaganda whole, you will find that you've been lied to and human fetuses are not parasites. What really scares me for you is that you can post a definition of a true parasite and not deduce that for yourself. It truly speaks to your level of awareness and intelligence. And here's just one clue for you. Does a human fetus live independently from his mother after a consistent and reliable 9 month gestation period? Just so you know shooter, that never happens with a true parasite. They are always parasites and don't eventually ever grow into sentient beings.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","07:58 PM","abortion-debates","232"

Your opinion means nothing with me Nor did it mention an unborn human fetus as a parasite.","Colonel Ingus","327131","Yes I do, because they are FACTUALLY CORRECT Not a problem. I don't let the intellect of any 12 year old effect me, I simply consider the source. As others here have so correctly mentioned, you are on the losing end of this debate because you do not know more than what one of the most renown obstetrics references ( Williams Obstetrics ) says about the matter in their 5000-page medical reference, nor do you know more than the multitude of dictionaries on the topic - which agree with what I said . You posts reveal that you are obviously desperate and in denial. With each message that you post on the matter you just dig your hole deeper and deeper by sticking your foot in your mouth over and over again, and making a fool of yourself in front of educated readers. Amongst all of your flippant rhetoric you didn't post one single fact that disproves what Williams Obstetrics said on the matter, what most every dictionary and encyclopedia says on the matter, or what I said on the matter. That's the most efficient way for you to lose the debate. Congratulations Facts do not equal blame. Try again. No I don't, medical references do because it's true. Pregnant women have to deal with these facts of pregnancy every day. If you can get past the nice pretty color pictures, then you should pick up a medical reference on the topic and read it sometime ... while you keep focusing on your right winged delusions. Sounds like a plan to me Dictionaries and medical references do not list ( cough ) opinion ( cough ) Archangel, if you didn't comprehend it the first time, here it is a second time; "" Fetal villious syncytiotrophoblast is remarkably efficient in extracting and sequestering essential nutrients from maternal circulation. In pregnant women with profound iron-deficiency anemia, for example, the iron stores of the fetus are normal; in pregnant women with severe folic acid deficiency causing severe anemia, the fetal hematocrit is normal. The fetus is a demanding and efficient parasite! Thus..the demands of the embryo are met at whatever cost to the maternal organism. "" ~Williams Obstetrics ( Chap. 7 ). Read it and weep ( again ). I do find it amazing that in all of the regurgitated tripe that you posted above, not once did you disprove any of the medical FACTS that we listed. Your silence is deafening. LOL. What's wrong Archangel, didn't your anti-choice propaganda web sites cover this topic?","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","08:41 PM","abortion-debates","235"

It is a totally natural and healthy relationship when balanced properly with a healthy diet. The baby grows and is fed by this process and is ultimately born and becomes an individual sentient being who not only lives apart from its mother but is a genetic reflection of its parents. Now post a link to a a true parasite that not only inherits the personality traits of its host, but also grows to become an independent sentient parasite that is self sustaining. Go on Ingus, impress me with a medical dictionary that will drum one of them up. And while you're at it, show a link that defines a ZEF and refers to it as a TRUE parasite.","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","08:50 PM","abortion-debates","236"

This theory is backed up by the definition of parasite in a dictionary( maybe they should look up 'common sense' or is that a theosaurus that you need?) The people that come up with this charming idea also seem to argue that the fetus is not a seperate entity until birth, therefore it cannot be a parasite..just a growth maybe? So lets look at another fast growing VERY dangerous growth in young men...testicles..these can cause many problems in the young male , one of which is making parasites in young girls( shame on you!) they can also cause behaviour problems in adolesents that are potentially fatal!! Its too late for most of us but maybe there are one or too precocious teenagers that would be better off by freeing themselves of these dreadful parasites. This would be beneficial to them and have an added bonus that they would not pass this nasty bit of inhuman properganda to thier own parasitical offspring. I just hope that this is a joke!","pro-life-vs-freedom-religion-there-conflict","04:14 AM","abortion-debates","240"
