We should encourage are youth to attend college, we should tell youth its ok to want to grow up and be someone important. There is nothing wrong with putting off a family for a career even if it involves the hard choice of having an abortion. As a society we should support this for the good of are children and are country. There is such a huge need for educated workers these days that telling a women she cant choose to continue her education is the most immoral thing I have ever heard. If you ever get an abortion to further your education you did the right thing.","istolebunnies","462633","Captain I am an my 3rd year of college and have been considering aborting my child because I want to get a degree do you know if the women center on campus will support me with this?

Its a great resource they wont tell you what to do they will just give you advice. You may also qualify for a scholarship its mostly just to offset the cost of the procedure.

I think my point was they, despite their convictions, viewed religion as something that had no place in in government. That it was something for the individual and not the state and the reason religion is excluded from The US Government? The faith of the founding fathers is clear by the wording of DOI and Bill of Rights, they all prayed attended church regularly, yet not so much as a token position of authority. Because they recognized throughout history including their own time religion was inflexible. It was a restrictive obstacle to progress and the type of freedom the founders had fought for. They had no intention after the war to trade one intolerant master for another. With close to 2 billion members you would think there would be at least one Christian led nation besides the Vatican, but there is not. What keeps those highly religious people who are a majority in a number of countries from following in the footsteps of Muslims who do? There was God's way and God's law and that was it. The definition of murder has changed often from the acceptance of revenge killings and sanctuary cities to 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree murder, manslaughter voluntary and involuntary, special circumstances, insanity and self defense and negligence are just some examples of the evolution of what is murder. The Church did indeed enact taxes when it held authority from prostitutes to goods and services and tithing to indulgences. They lost the ability to tax when they lost their authority to rule. From what? Sumerian to Judaism to Catholicism to Islam to Protestant or Lutheran, Baptist, Mormon? Does it matter? A branch splits and they condemn each other as not following faithfully. Someone experiences divine revelation and starts something new but the requirements to obey what God commands, to submit to God remains the same. God is always eternal and gave his rules that are not open to debate or revision a very long time ago. At best the name changes people don't vote and determine what God's law is to be. Because mandates from government are based on the needs of the people whether honestly made or not. They may be discussed and overturned, modified or challenged. It may be near impossible to have our government vote to make murder legal in all circumstances, but it could happen. Secular law permits divorce and does not require a women to marry her rapist. Instead of giving guidelines on the treatment of slaves it prohibits the practice. Religion has a place in society, but not in government. It does not accept that other Gods exist and therefore has a wedge that cannot be overcome. Religions accept other religions because they have to, not because they want to.","why-would-anyone-choose-have-child-over-there-own-education","03:31 AM","abortion-debates","54"

If you have the personality to accomplish being a parent and having a career or changing your vision for your life without missing a beat then good for you give yourself a pat on the back as you don't represent every women in the world. It is one thing as a man to make the statement it is quit another to be faced with time running out to make a decision. Only she can decide what is the best choice for her. Anybody who thinks otherwise is arrogantly presumptuous. Your opinion concerning murder, a child and an accessory is just that your opinion. To push it as if it were fact is emotional blackmail. Let her make her choice based on facts both what she will give up and what she will gain honestly and without personal beliefs determining for her. She is the one that will deal with her choice for the rest of her life, while you will have forgotten she existed within a year.","why-would-anyone-choose-have-child-over-there-own-education","03:58 AM","abortion-debates","55"

Please read the following testimony. Healing After Abortion | The Official Jennifer O'Neill Site You should also read the following: What does the Bible say about when life begins? And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she has a miscarriage, yet there is no further injury, he shall surely be fined as the womans husband may demand of him; and he shall pay as the judges decide. But if there is further injury, then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life. (Exodus 21:22-23) Straight from the Jewish Torah, God immediately affirms the value of human life in a mothers womb. Next, a divinely appointed prophet from the womb : Jeremiah 1:5 Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations. Other prophets and Biblical personalities ordained from their mothers wombs: Samson: Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God, very awesome. And I did not ask him where he came from, nor did he tell me his name. But he said to me, `Behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son, and now you shall not drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death. (Judges 13:6-7, see also Judges 16:17) John the Baptist : For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine or liquor; and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, while yet in his mothers womb. (Luke 1:15) Jesus, the Son of God: Then the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name JESUS. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David. And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end. Luke chapter 1 The Apostle Paul : But when He who had set me apart, even from my mothers womb, and called me through His grace, was pleased (Galatians 1:15) It is clear in scripture that in some way, God creates life in a mothers womb. Psalm 139:13 For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mothers womb. Of course, the question for the pro-abortion crowd, is: What divine insight does the pro-abortion crowd think they have to where they can destroy in a mothers womb that which God is somehow instrumental in creating? You don't know who's in there, or what their divine purpose is. Choose life. Your mother did.","why-would-anyone-choose-have-child-over-there-own-education","07:57 AM","abortion-debates","57"

You will see a child and wonder what yours would look like at the same age. You will see mothers caring for their babies and wish you hadn't killed your own. It will haunt you year after year after year. Mother Teresa on abortion: America needs no words from me to see how your decision in Roe v. Wade has deformed a great nation. The so-called right to abortion has pitted mothers against their children and women against men. It has sown violence and discord at the heart of the most intimate human relationships. It has aggravated the derogation of the fathers role in an increasingly fatherless society. It has portrayed the greatest of gifts a child as a competitor, an intrusion, and an inconvenience. It has nominally accorded mothers unfettered dominion over the independent lives of their physically dependent sons and daughters But I feel that the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion, because it is a war against the child a direct killing of the innocent child murder by the mother herself. And if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another?","why-would-anyone-choose-have-child-over-there-own-education","06:08 PM","abortion-debates","59"
