"01-15-2007","9391",6,"Steeeeve","247029","by the other 5 or so definitions. Either way, Sapien should be the word you look up as Homo Sapien is two words...but since we have 5 other definitions (this includes my at home websters) then I'll take the 5 over the 1. So I guess I disagree. Did you look at your own link? 5 other definitions (sources) saying the exact same thing...not one of them says anything about brain mass I feel like you aren't answering my question. I am weighing the moral value of a human verus a cast or other animal. Why would the charateristic ""human"" be more valuable than say a cat...assuming they both have consciousness?","Sigma","247270","I looked up Homo Sapien , which is the species we belong to. Do I have to repeat myself, Steve? Read it again: I don't care whether you agree with the definition or not. I asked if you agreed that this definition seems to imply a mental existence lol! Ok, lets look at those other definitions. First one: The modern species of humans . How does one determine if the fetus is of the modern species of humans? Second one: The biological classification of modern humans . How does one determine if the fetus is a modern human? Third one: the only surviving hominid; species to which modern man belongs . How do we determine this, Steve? The only definition that mentions any sort of criteria was the one I quoted. Wouldn't you agree the definition I quoted implies a mental existence, Steve? Let's look at it again, Steve. It says that humans are characterized by a brain capacity averaging 1400 cc (85 cubic in.) and by dependence upon language and the creation and utilization of complex tools. You feel this way because you aren't coming to your point. I am answering as best I can. I did not say that human animals are intrinsically more valuable than a cat. We are weighing the moral value of a human, though, which is why it is part of the criteria. Or are you trying to draw the discussion off-topic?","why-pro-life","10:41 AM","abortion-debates","76"

You determine this by taking a biology class Yeah, I'd say it implies more of a full development than ""mental existence"". No we are not weighing that...I made the question not you. We are weighing the moral value of a human over a cat. What makes the human have more value than a cat....what about a monkey that has more ""intelligence"" than some humans?

Are you trying to tell me that the dictionary definition cannot tell us what it is to be human?! You can't be serious! The dictionary definition knows all and tells all! You must be wrong. So what is the criteria, then? What makes us 'a human' as opposed to 'human'. Oh, so only fully developed... things... are human if they fit that criteria? What are they before they are fully developed? This question is off-topic, then.

"01-15-2007","9391",6,"dislexia","245432","Other reasons for pro life You do not know who you are aborting, they could be a future presidant or a nobel peace prize winner. In many states, if a mother can't or won't raise her child, she can drop them of at her local fier station (and hospital) with no questions asked. You would be destroying whole generations to come. (that baby leads to more babys....) Babys are the outcome of sex, If you don't want a baby, don't have sex!!!!!! If the case is rape, well, give the baby to adoption and insted of founding abortion, help fight rapeists with organisations like ""just yell fire"". Abortion leads to cancer","procrastinating","247330","We can abort a future president? the president has been the leading cause of 72nd to 168th ""trimester"" abortions. Drop it at a fire station? it goes to a foster home, where the chances of a child being abused or molested are exponentialy higher. You would be destroying future generations to come? The people that survive already do that, we don't need more to add to that: CIA, NAZI party, other imperialists. Don't have sex? don't eat, don't sleep, don't groom yourself. Sex is a natural human instinct, and the only true reason for human existence. Just yell fire? The amount of rapists is the result of an overcrowded and averly frustated society which has not taken advantage of abortion enough. Abortion leads to cancer? So do Mouthwashes, feminine products, the sun, color cosmetics, cellular telephones, toothpastes, bubble baths, shampoos, microwaves, lye, MSG, mineral oil, talc, whole milk, oscar meyer hot dogs, computer radiation (uh oh), nuclear power plants, some carpets, Zodiac flea collars, and hundreds of chemicals.","why-pro-life","04:19 PM","abortion-debates","79"

Are you suggesting the dictionary is meaningless? If you want to try and define every word in every definition then you could come to the conclusion that nothing is defined. You asked questions that were not related to definition as it assumes some level of knowledge (ie not questioning every word in the definition). The criteria for the word human is set up in the dictionary as that is what they are there for. I don't claim you have to put any moral significance on this. I said the definition you selectivily chose implies a fully developed body. This contradicts the other 5 definitions in the same link you gave me so I reject the definition you gave. It beats me what dictionary.com (the source of that definition) thinks 2yr olds are. It is right on topic. Why can't you answer? The discussion we were having was about consciousness and that being the deciding factor for moral value. I said that my cat has consciousness and then you said my cat was not human. My question is why should ""human"" matter?","why-pro-life","05:12 PM","abortion-debates","80"

On what basis do you disagree that dependence upon language and the creation and utilization of complex tools implies a mental existence? I see. You are then claiming the dictionary does not provide a criteria for being human, and instead assumes we know this criteria? What is the criteria then, according to Steve? Contradicts in what way? I see no contradiction. The other definitions provide no criteria, while the one I quoted did. Yet it is unacceptable to you for some reason you have not supplied. The deciding factor for moral value... in humans. Whether it applies to non-human animals or not would be the subject for another thread.","why-pro-life","06:15 PM","abortion-debates","81"

You could certainly have mental existence and not have language or utilization of complex tools. Actually I am claiming the dictionary defines human. How scientific classification works is not the purpose of the dictionary. Seems you are claiming the dictionary can't tell us anything. I don't even know what you are typing to me! Well, ignoring the fact that you chose ""homo sapiens"" as opposed to one homo sapien (a group instead of individual) the other 4 or 5 definitions provide a definition. You seem to want the dictionary to be more than it is...I can't help you there. The only point I make is that a human embryo qualifies under the definition of human or human being. Obviously those two nouns describe something and an embryo is part of what they describe. So you don't want to answer or what? I made the question...you refuse to answer eventhough I have answered all your questions. Very classy.","why-pro-life","10:00 AM","abortion-debates","82"

Scientific classification is not the purpose of the dictionary. The dictionary's sole purpose is recording how people generally use terms. It has no objective validity and no use beyond informing us how people generally use terms. The only way this has any validity in this debate is if the question is: ""What is the dictionary definition"". The dictionary has no use in this debate beyond that. That is not the question here. The question here is: ""Does the fetus qualify conceptually under the philosophical umbrella of 'human being' or 'person'?"" That is a question the dictionary can never answer. I've never considered it important to this debate. If you wish to discuss this, I'd be happy to contribute in a new thread.","why-pro-life","03:27 PM","abortion-debates","86"

That is not the question. Philosophy doesn't define terms. The questions is ""Does the fetus qualify as morally valuable"". The fact that the fetus is a human is rather irrelevant but don't go around saying ""it isn't a human therefore ok"" because 1) it in fact is a human and 2) this doesn't prove or disprove anything. I feel it is very important as I don't say which characteristics are important to give it moral value I just say being a human gives you moral value in and of its self. I'll consider starting a new thread since you feel it is irrelevant to this one (although I disagree with this)","why-pro-life","10:10 AM","abortion-debates","88"
"01-17-2007","9391",6,"ShadowPikachu","247426","Well, I had decided not to post on this thread and only read it, but I could not contain myself over the last few posts. Steeeeve, who just a few pages back acted like the dictionary definition was the be-all end-all thing, is now trying to squirm wildly when a dictionary definition is not one that he would like. ROFLMAO!! A few posts up he says this: pretty much ridiculing the definition by dictionary.com, when a few pages ago he says this: and then the next several posts acted like the definition there was a holy command or something. Can't have it both ways Steeeeve.","Steeeeve","247522","I was ridiculing dictionary.com's definition...but you fail to realize that dictionary.com gives many sources (one being its own). Dictionary.com's own definition doesn't make much sense and certainly doesn't imply a mental existense. It also contradicts the other 4 or 5 definitions provided by dictionary.com. I choose to go with the 4. With ""human being"" they all seem to be the same. Nice try though.","why-pro-life","10:14 AM","abortion-debates","89"
