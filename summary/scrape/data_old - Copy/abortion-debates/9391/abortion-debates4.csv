"01-10-2007","9391",4,"Steeeeve","246665","Every word has multiply definitions including the word ""definition"" ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/definition) . The ability to understand what a word means in context is something learned (hopefully). If I say ""the definition of the word desk is..."" I don't mean the sharpness of the word desk. Likewise when I say ""the fetus is a human"" you can gather that 1) I an using it as a noun and 2) the context of the word in order to choose the appropriate definition. It should be noted that human never has ""mental existence"" in the definition. Person goes the same way. To say ""you are a person"" you take the noun and view the context. The context rules out definitions 2 and 3 and thus we are left with 1 (the main entry) as the definition for that word. I know this conversation sounds petty but it is rather frustrating that people are manipulating words to support a cause and then claiming to not understand a basic language structure. If you want to say the fetus isn't worthy of life then so be it but don't start justifying this claim but changing the definitions of words such as ""person"" and ""human""...that is just stupid","Another opinion","246674","You are the one saying that only one definition is valid in a particular context - that is an unjustified claim. The statement ""I discriminate against certain humans"" could work just as well for either definition: ""I discriminate against certain members of the species homo sapien"" or ""I discriminate against certain people"". The context does not always specify which definition is used, as in the example I just gave. Similarly, your statement ""you are a person"" can also work with multiple definitions of ""person"". It can mean ""you are a living human "" or ""you are an individual of specified character "" - ex. 'you are an stuborn individual "". In the context of our discussions, you have been clear enough about which definition you are using that I know which definition YOU use. If the only two people who would ever see my statement ""I discriminate against certain humans"" were you and I, then I would not be concerned since we both know what is meant. However, in a forum such as this, other people (i.e. readers) also would see that statement and might misconstrue that to mean ""I discriminate against certain people"" since they would not know that it was the first definition of ""member of species homo sapien"" that was meant. THAT is what I am trying to avoid. I am trying to avoid having others jump to the wrong conclusion due to lack of clearly defined terms. ---------------- Either way, I suspect that your main goal in trying to convince pro-choice proponents of stating ""I discriminate against certain humans"" is that you equate discrimination based on mental existence with all other forms of discrimination (sex, race, etc.). So, let's address that question directly instead of dancing around the issue. I disagree that those types of discriminations are equivalent due to the main reason that I, personally, and I believe many if not most others are against discrimination based on sex and race. I am against discrimination based on sex and race because I myself would not like to be discriminated against for something that is not within my control and for something for which there is no reason to discriminate. Such a type of discrimination against me would cause me suffering and, using my general moral approach of empathy and trying to treat others as I would have myself be treated, I generally denounce discrimination against certain people based on aspects of themselves that they cannot control and for which there is no justifiable reason to discriminate. (This is as opposed to discrimination against people based on their actions - ex. crimes - being permissible, as well as discrimination against people based on their inability to control their actions - ex. limiting the rights of children - being permissible.). Discrimination against human life forms with no mental existence is irrelevant to my moral stance of empathy and ""do unto others"" since there is no ""somebody"" there with which to empathize and no ""other"" who I would be treating as myself.","why-pro-life","04:44 PM","abortion-debates","46"

A sperm is not a member of the species homo sapien. This is basic biology. Sorry but you don't get to define words how you see fit.","Shooterandproud","246694","And what? What more is there to say? Biology 101, steeeve. A sperm is a member of the homo sapien species.","why-pro-life","09:31 PM","abortion-debates","48"
"01-10-2007","9391",4,"Steeeeve","246616","And I am a clump of human cell with shoes on...what is your point? no. You seem to refuse the idea that ""human"" as a noun is used to describe a human being meaning the entity as a whole and not the individual cells that make it up. I am sorry you don't understand this but the word means what it means. I find it odd that you even care what you call a fetus anyway. Your sperm is a human now? You should invest in a biology book.","Shooterandproud","246699","My point is, an embryo has neither intelligence nor shoes. Then whats your usage? ""Human"" as an adjective mean any oraganic matter that contains human DNA. ""Human"" as a noun means any independent living being or entity, as in Human being. Where did you get that piece of information? Who told you I cared? By your standards, yes. It is just as human as an embryo, and to call it otherwise would be discrimination.","why-pro-life","10:24 PM","abortion-debates","49"
"01-10-2007","9391",4,"Another opinion","246618","Steeeeve, dislexia, Shooterandproud, and ShadowPikachu : The four of you seem to be engaged in yet another unresolveable battle of semantics - in this case about the definition of the term ""a human"". The trouble is that there are really TWO definitions of the term ""a human"" - the official definition and the common-use definition. One can legitimately argue, as Steeeeve does, that the official definition of a human as a ""member of the species homo sapien"" would only require a complete set of human DNA and the beginning of the growth process - so a zygote would then qualify under the official definition. However, nearly all uses of the term ""a human"" in common discussion are on topics other than abortion, where ""a human"" is discusses as a born human and, at the very least, the assumption is made that the being in question possesses a mental existence. At least I assume that when I hear the term ""a human"" and I know that this is a very common assumption - as demonstrated by the frequent disputes about the use of this term. Therefore, the term ""a human"" automatically generates a certain amount of sympathy because of these unofficial conotations of mental existence that are added to the definition. Steeeeve: I know you might feel justified in using the term ""a human"" and trying to force pro-choice people to admit to discriminating against humans since you stand firm on the official definition. However, you have to admit that it is somewhat disingenuous of you to ignore the fact that this term has many unofficial conotations attached to it that do not apply to a zygote or embryo - mental existence being one of them. Since words, after all, are used for COMMUNICATION, the use of the word ""a human"" in this way is a purposeful distortion of the message. Can't you try to find some term that you can all agree on? Shooterandproud and ShadowPikachu: Since the official definition of ""a human"" probably does include a zygote, Steeeeve is technically right, but I fully sympathize with you that the term ""a human"" is loaded with meanings that are attached to it due to its common use. Since there exists this difference between common use and official definition, wouldn't it be better for you as well to find some term that you and Steeeeve (and other pro-life proponents) could agree on?","Shooterandproud","246701","Thanks, but to clear some things up, I am not disputing the scientific status of the embryo. The debate is whether or not it possesses intelligence. If it does, then it deserves rights just like any other human. If it doesn't, then it doesn't deserve rights. We are trying to establish whether its a being or not, because if it is not a being or ""person"", as in possessing intelligence, then there is no reason why it should overpower a being who does.","why-pro-life","10:29 PM","abortion-debates","50"
"01-10-2007","9391",4,"Steeeeve","246658","How can you get anymore specific then ""member of the species Homo Sapien""?","Shooterandproud","246703","And give me one good reason why an embryo is part of that species? And if I'm not mistaken, the defonition of ""discriminate"" is: # To make distinctions on the basis of class or category without regard to individual merit; show preference or prejudice: was accused of discriminating against women; discriminated in favor of his cronies. So, in essance, this would not apply to embryos since they have no individual merit, or class.","why-pro-life","11:00 PM","abortion-debates","51"

Like you said, you would say ""you are a stubborn person""..not ""you are a person"" and then say ""what! that clearly means you are a stubborn person"". Seriously, context is not hard to figure out. You shouldn't worry about other people that read our back and forth conversation They will miss context no matter what as they don't read the entire conversation normally. Actually I just find it funny that people can't admit to discriminating...we all do it including me. The fact that some don't admit to it is amusing and brings up questions about whether they feel it is wrong or not deep inside. I believe we can discriminate based on sex...probably very rarely race. Men and Women are different and that requires discrimination sometimes. Take the draft for example or just simply segregation of bathrooms. Race would be a hard one but if you support affirmative action you are for discrimination. This is off topic but if you had the same approach (treat others as you wish to be treated) then if you would not want to be aborted then wouldn't it be logical to treat others the same way? Well, I still don't get the mental existence thing...it isn't unique to humans and it certainly leaves things open for picking a different point of development for obtaining rights.","why-pro-life","10:33 AM","abortion-debates","52"
"01-11-2007","9391",4,"ShadowPikachu","246685","This is my last post on this thread because I don't care to get into little debates over semantics, as it is a waste of my time and never would be resolved. I don't really care what you decide to call a human. I will call a human whatever I like whether you complain or not, and in fact I'm willing to bet most americans would say the same. Very easily. For instance, would you give somone who has died all of the same rights as a living mentally existant human being? Of course not! And yet, they are still members of the species Homo Sapien, so by not giving them the same rights, that would be discrimination by your standards. See how the definition here is too vague? (On second thought, you probably wouldn't admit it if you did because you seem rather obsessed with the ""official definition"" ). If you look at the second and third listings in the definition another_opinion was talking about, you can see it clearly implies mental existence. Just because one definition is at the top doesn't mean it is more commonly used, it just means they had to write them out in a list. A foetus cannot be worthy of life as it does not mentally (and in many other ways) live. Discrimination against a life form that is made of human cells yet is without mental existence does not provide a sense of empathy, and that is why you try to get us to give the appearance of a mental existence, which I for one will never do.","Steeeeve","246731","I get the idea that our English classes are failing on every level. For one, it is hard to be a member of something when you are dead. Secondly, the definition is what it is. Are you proposing that we just each find our own definition for every word and go with it? If the answer is yes then I must admit that I don't understand your post as I have not learned the ancient ShadowPikachu language. My cat mentally lives...she must be a human Anyway, they don't imply mental existence. There is no way to assume mental existence is a requirement out of any of those. This one fails due to fallacy. haha, I never claimed to give the appearance of mental existence. I clearly admit that it does not exist for the embryo and most of the life of the fetus. I just happen to think that mental existence doesn't matter.","why-pro-life","10:42 AM","abortion-debates","53"

I like my new shoes by the way. the noun. saying "" I am a human"" makes human the noun in that sentence. Saying ""I have a human hair on me"" makes human the adjective. I just point out that saying the embryo is not A HUMAN BEING is false and we shouldn't change the definition just to make people feel better about abortion. You are still debating it... If you didn't care then you would have simply said ""ok call it a human....a fetus is a human that has no intelligence (or whatever) and thus does not have rights"" there you go with the adjective noun switch again.","why-pro-life","10:47 AM","abortion-debates","54"
