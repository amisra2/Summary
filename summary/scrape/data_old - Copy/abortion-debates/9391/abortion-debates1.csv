Lets take a look: Reasons for Pro-life: 1)Protecting the ""innocent"" baby or embryo or whatever 2)Earining brownie points in heavan I can't think of anymore, please post and i'll add to the list. Reasons for pro-choice: 1)This is a woman's body, not yours, not mine, and certainly not the governments. 2)An embryo can not make a decision, but a mother knows her circumstances best, therefore she should choose for the both. 3)An Embryo is not a sentient life form, and does not posses self awareness or consciousness, or to quote Another Opinion: ""Mentally exist"". 4)The only thing an embryo and humans have in common is a strand of DNA. 5)Abortion has some positive effects on society, as in the book Freakonomics by um... forgot the guy, Steve something, the author cites that the legalization of abortions caused a rapid decrease in crime, which makes sense if you think about it. Unwanted children are 10X more likely to become criminals. 6)And embryo does not have a 100% possiblilty of growing into a human being. 20% of pregnancies end in a miscarrige. 7)Birth control is not 100% effective. As I have said before, my friend's mom had her sister on the pill. Even though this makes up a small percentage of abortion, it still makes up some percentage, which is reason enough. 8)Being forced to carry through and unwanted pregnancy can have devastating effects on a women, namely financially and emotionally. In conclusion, I quote Mr. Richard C. Carrier: ""First, abortion is a notable benefit to society. The harm to a society that is caused by an excess of unchecked population growth is severe and well-documented. The ability of societies to check population growth without legalizing abortion has proven nearly non-existent: there are few countries in which abortion is outlawed or stigmatized that are not suffering harshly from overcrowding, with all the attendant economic, criminal, or political troubles. In contrast, most nations that allow the procedure are maintaining stable populations with nearly zero growth, and exhibiting more or less general prosperity. From a purely pragmatic perspective aimed at the interests of the commonwealth, abortion is at best a great benefit to mankind and at worst a necessary evil. And for women who regard zero growth as a moral imperative, abortion can even be a moral necessity from their point of view--although this would be better called a matter of principle, so as to distinguish this personal belief from the morally universal. Second, abortion is a significant benefit for the individual woman. The risks of death or permanent disability certainly must be greater for a woman who carries a fetus to term and bears a child, prematurely or not, than for a woman who aborts before the third trimester of her pregnancy. And the social and economic ruin that can ensue from an untimely motherhood is a serious harm as well, and although this could be alleviated by recourse to adoption, free medical care for pregnant women, and public welfare for women unable to work as a consequence of their pregnancy, these solutions are not as simple as they sound, and are not so universally available as people might think (even the United States, among the wealthiest of nations, has no such welfare system in place, not to mention a very poor excuse for a medicare system, and there is no desirable option for orphans in nations like India or Chad). Moreover, the potential physical harm from bearing a child simply cannot be alleviated. Abortion thus supplies some benefit for many women. An act that causes no involuntary harm and produces some benefits for individuals and society in general should never be outlawed. This is based on the principle that laws should only exist to preserve and protect the liberty of individuals and, when no liberty is at stake either way, to increase the general welfare of all citizens. Whether that principle is misinformed remains to be seen. But from the above analysis, there appears no way in which outlawing abortion would even indirectly preserve or protect the liberty of any individual, or provide any general benefit to the citizen body without uneccessarily depriving individuals of their liberty.""","why-pro-life","01:06 PM","abortion-debates","1"

As you can see, this argument is fallacious and can be used for either side of the issue. So, if there was a way to know that that baby would be infertile it would be alright in your view to abort? This is a very controversial issue that you are stating here as a fact. At best, it is just a scientific hypothesis, and no conclusive scientific findings have been made on this issue. It is rather dishonest of you to state it as a fact when it is anything but.","why-pro-life","09:56 PM","abortion-debates","4"

Should everyone be forced to have sex 24/7 because the people may be someone? I would've added this, but this can have devastating emotional effects, knowing your child is out there somewhere. That is good. We need population control, as overpopulation is a problem to come. I only wish it were so simple. Abortion is always ok in rape or incest hands down. A woman should not have to pay for the crinimality of the rapist. Will post if you back this up.","why-pro-life","12:41 AM","abortion-debates","5"

Human beings, or personhood, begins at first sign of intelligence or self awareness. There is no basis for rights without that, as it is what makes humans unique. We don't give animals the same rights as humans and animals DO have intelligence. In fact, hunting is legal, and animals do posses intellgence. So, why should something that possesses NO intelligence have more rights than lives that do? I beg to differ. I still fail to see any logic or reasoning in your argument. Embryos are not human beings. They do not posses intelligence, heck, they don't even posses limbs. They are really only a clump of floating flesh living parasitically off of its host: the woman. The only think that it and a human have in common is a strand of dna, nothing more. I don't see how anyone with considerable intelligence can consider it a human.","why-pro-life","12:47 AM","abortion-debates","6"

You see, most abortions occur early, before a brain is even developed. Without the awareness that develops after a brain is formed and the onnections in the neurons begin to be made, the foetus cannot make any sort of choice as it is not mentally existant, and your question is fundamentally flawed.","why-pro-life","11:43 AM","abortion-debates","8"

What trouble's me is that, if men had to go through what women did in pregnancy, the pro-life movement would be totally non-existant. Men are really not capable of being pro-life without being a hypocryte, as they have not experienced pregnancy. Why that is not true of the pro-choice side, is that we let the women choose, and she can choose both ways if she wishes. The pro-life movement involves force and blatant disregard for rights of the women, to the point of violation, yet the men have almost no knowledge of what it is like to get pregnant or have babies. Many pro-life men do know what raising a child is like, but they do not know what raising a child is like when you are a 14 year old girl with three kids already and no money. Yes, not all abortions go this way, but some do, and thats the point. You don't know every women's circumstances, and until you do, you are in no position to force her to abide by your morals, and thus harming her.","why-pro-life","12:51 PM","abortion-debates","11"

I think I heard that men make up over 70% of anti-choicers. Just look at how many that is, and yet, not a single one of them will ever become pregnant. You are definately right that if men could become pregnant, there would be virtually no anti-choice movement in existence (maybe a few small pockets here and there, but no organized movement), and no large argument over abortion. Instead, we get stuck with a bunch of people who for the most part never have to worry about becoming pregnant, trying to make choices and decisions for women who should be able to make those decisions for themselves.","why-pro-life","10:46 PM","abortion-debates","12"

It is just as accurate to call you anti-life as it is for you to call pro-lifers anti-choice. The best way to approach it, IMO, is to use terms that don't intentionally make the other side out to look bad--it is also accurate to say that prolifers are pro-life, because they are against killing human life. Just as it is also accurate to call an anti-lifer ""pro-choice""--they are indeed for freedom of choice to destroy human life. I believe constructive dialogue is best rather than intentionally using terms you know will put people off. Don't you agree? And really, there's no need to so easily getr defensive every time someone disagrees with you on something here. There's nothing wrong with saying ""ok, I'll consider that."" No one said you had to stop calling people anti-choice. But know that if you use terms like that, you're more likely to have the same tactics used against you and someone may call you an 'anti-lifer'--they'd be completely justified in doing so. So I merely suggest not using a tactic at all and use constructive terminolgy that you know won't aggravate others.
