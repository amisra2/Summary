As for the problems with birth control, are you now saying that people perhaps just shouldn't have sex at all except at times they want to concieve?","maximus","248489","If I had to choose between being able to feed my daughter and kill my baby I would choose to sacrifice feeding my daughter. Hope stays alive in that situation. But once the new baby is destroyed and life is taken then there is no hope and love is extinguished. The problem is that you already have two children when it comes time for the decision of abortion. Why would you choose your older child over the younger one? Abortion kills a living human being. Are there not enough social service programs out there that could assist in this instance? How many people in this world have made it out of poverty to live a good life? Wouldn't you want to give them a shot? When you divorce sex from its procreative potential then problems arise. It's not that people ""shouldn't have sex at all except at times they want to conceive."" But they shouldn't have sex at all except at times when they are willing to accept conception and the baby that comes from it. I mean that married persons can have sex when they want to unite and form bonds and replenish and express their love for one another, even at times when procreation will not naturally occur. When two persons interact in this manner then they should be willing to accept that third person into their lives that may be created at any time--not as an intruder--but as a welcome visitor--because they were the ones who invited him, in a certain sense. If they cannot accept this then they should abstain.

A foetus does not experience these things, therefore it would not suffer at an early stage abortion. How could you possibly allow one child to suffer just so you can give birth to another you may not be able to provide for properly? I don't think benefits here count when you have assets, such as a house you can sell. Stability for my daughter is what matters most to me, and ending up being moved to a dodgy area [which is all that is left to rent from the Council] isn't an option for me. Not when the other option is to terminate a pregnancy without causing the foetus to suffer. After 12 weeks gestation I'd perhaps have reconsidered my options again, but so early on I had made my decision. Nice idea but it's never going to happen. Sex is part of a relationship and the small chance of conception isn't going to stop people from having sex when they don't want to concieve or be prepared to concieve. Some families never want children but they are hardly going to abstain for life. Contraception might never be 100% but it's the most people have unless they choose the permanant sterilisation option, which isn't going to be an option for a woman who wants to have a gap between having children. Perhaps in the past women were prepared to have every child they became pregnant with and ended up with 15 kids they couldn't feed, but in this day and age it isn't even worth discussing as a solution.","why-pro-life","08:00 PM","abortion-debates","157"

Fetal Pain: A Systematic Multidisciplinary Review of the Evidence. JAMA, 2005; 294(8): 947-54. ABSTRACT Context Proposed federal legislation would require physicians to inform women seeking abortions at 20 or more weeks after fertilization that the fetus feels pain and to offer anesthesia administered directly to the fetus. This article examines whether a fetus feels pain and if so, whether safe and effective techniques exist for providing direct fetal anesthesia or analgesia in the context of therapeutic procedures or abortion. Evidence Acquisition Systematic search of PubMed for English-language articles focusing on human studies related to fetal pain, anesthesia, and analgesia. Included articles studied fetuses of less than 30 weeks gestational age or specifically addressed fetal pain perception or nociception. Articles were reviewed for additional references. The search was performed without date limitations and was current as of June 6, 2005. Evidence Synthesis Pain perception requires conscious recognition or awareness of a noxious stimulus. Neither withdrawal reflexes nor hormonal stress responses to invasive procedures prove the existence of fetal pain, because they can be elicited by nonpainful stimuli and occur without conscious cortical processing. Fetal awareness of noxious stimuli requires functional thalamocortical connections. Thalamocortical fibers begin appearing between 23 to 30 weeks gestational age, while electroencephalography suggests the capacity for functional pain perception in preterm neonates probably does not exist before 29 or 30 weeks. For fetal surgery, women may receive general anesthesia and/or analgesics intended for placental transfer, and parenteral opioids may be administered to the fetus under direct or sonographic visualization. In these circumstances, administration of anesthesia and analgesia serves purposes unrelated to reduction of fetal pain, including inhibition of fetal movement, prevention of fetal hormonal stress responses, and induction of uterine atony. Conclusions Evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester. Little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques. Similarly, limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion. Anesthetic techniques currently used during fetal surgery are not directly applicable to abortion procedures.","thelmoose","248855","Looking at your own ultrasound is hardly the way to answer the question of the age at which fetal perception occurs. First, ultrasound is not a test that could answer that question, and second, what do you know about it? What follows is a sytematic review of the literature on this subject. I submit the reference and the abstract. For you and max:","why-pro-life","06:45 PM","abortion-debates","165"
