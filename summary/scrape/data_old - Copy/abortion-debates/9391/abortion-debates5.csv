Secondly, the definition is what it is. My cat mentally lives...she must be a human","Sigma","246755","The definition makes no distinction between those alive and those dead. Were a dictionary definition used, it would be difficult to deny the dead equal protection based on your reasoning. The dictionary definition also does not make a distinction based on the number of chromosomes. A sperm is human in the same way the fetus is human: they both contain human DNA. However, this is all moot. The dictionary definition has no authority over how we use words. It simply records how words are generally used. In a philosophical debate such as this, shadings of meaning are used constantly that you will not find in any dictionary. It is up to the participants to agree to use a word in a certain way to avoid confusion between them. A philosophical argument is to argue concepts , not semantics. Non-human animals are usually not considered to posess consciousness as we know it. However, we can make the distinction that your cat does not have a unique human consciousness.","why-pro-life","11:45 AM","abortion-debates","61"
"01-11-2007","9391",5,"Another opinion","246754","I would not have wanted to be aborted, but (in applying that general rule) that would mean that each pregnancy would have to be forced to term - that is a balance where I would favor freedom of body.","jyoshu","246757","Forgive me for taking one part of your post only, but this struck me. You're statement is that 'it would mean pregnancy would be forced to come to term.' Pregnancy is, by default, going to come to term. It's the natural progression of things. What is being forced is the termination of the pregnancy by the mother. That's a change from the natural progression of things to an un-natural event, caused by external intervention. I think viewing this only from the standpoint of women being forced to do something is too limited a way of viewing the situation. It should never be taken into account without also taking into account that the fetus is being forced to die, and therefore prevented from growing up and living it's life. Abortion should never be viewed in terms apart from it's moral and philosophical implications, IMO.","why-pro-life","11:49 AM","abortion-debates","62"

It is moot but at the same time aggravating that people claim the fetus is a ""human"" and thus this justifies abortion. I believe to you this doesn't even matter. yet there is the word ""human"" agian...what makes human so important? (note: I agree that human is important).","why-pro-life","11:53 AM","abortion-debates","63"

We have changed our lives in very unnatural ways all the time, with no complaint from others. When our lives are artificially sustained by external blood transfusions, or machines that otherwise keep us alive, that is ""un-natural"". Does that make it bad? If we were to say that artificial interference in the natural progression of things is bad, then a tremendous amount of people would die by being denied artificial help. Whether or not something is ""natural"" is irrelevant - the relevant thing is the ethics and morality behind it, and the reasons behind those ethical or moral views. As for the fetus, I don't see much of a difference between a fetus prior to mental existence being killed and an unfertilized egg being killed except for the state of its *potential* for becoming a person (a fetus probably will become a person, whereas an unfertilized egg might). I personally find such potential important but MUCH less important than the rights of an existing person - i.e. the mother.","why-pro-life","12:56 PM","abortion-debates","65"

"01-11-2007","9391",5,"Another opinion","246776","Yes, if you place a higher value on all human life than on the wants of the person carrying to term, then you would be against abortion. But what is the logical reason for placing that higher value on ALL human life in the first place? That is where the unsupported proclamation happens. I think that any being with a mental existence deserves rights - animals as well. I suppose that part of the reason that I don't automatically give equal rights to animals is that they are not part of the moral consensus. Morality is often a type of deal one makes with others - I will treat you well and you treat me well. Our moral stances are most challenged when we are in an environment where there is no moral consensus. Ex. Do we treat others well who treat us very badly? There is no way to make a moral consensus with animals. Many animals have shown codes of behavior toward others of the same or other species in dominant or submissive behavior, etc. but these do not seem to be based on any rational analysis.","Steeeeve","246805","It is as unsupported as any proclamation you make regarding when value begins. That was my point last time we discussed this and it is still my point. there should have been a ""not"" in the thing you quoted from me","why-pro-life","03:18 PM","abortion-debates","69"

And what makes something human in the noun sense of the word different from the adjective sense? Could it be that, ultimately, we're ""characterized by a brain capacity averaging 1400 cc (85 cubic in.) and by dependence upon language and the creation and utilization of complex tools"" like the dictionary tells us? Wouldn't that imply a mental existence to be a member? Special? In what way did I say it was ""special""? Do you mean, what is different from a human consciousness than the animal consciousness? I have not asserted animal consciousness exists; you have.","why-pro-life","05:32 PM","abortion-debates","70"

But the noun sense of the word says ""member of species homo sapien"" ...not having a brain capacity of 1400cc. ok, well if it does exist then does this change the way we deal with animals?

Besides, a new-born is classified as in the species homo sapien and yet its brain is only 386cc or so. Any biology book also states that every living organism is classified in a species. Where would the fetus go if not human? So no, I do not agree that mental existence is required. they certainly make sense. I ask why does being human matter? You seem to think that you have to be 1) human and 2) conscious in order to have moral value. I am asking why the human criteria exists.","why-pro-life","03:57 PM","abortion-debates","73"

It appears to be that humans are characterized by a brain capacity averaging 1400 cc (85 cubic in.) and by dependence upon language and the creation and utilization of complex tools. Therefore any who do not fall under this definition cannot be human. Would you agree? How else could the fetus be human if not by this dictionary definition? So, you're pulling definitions out of your XXX now? I don't care what you agree with the definition or not. I asked if you agreed that this definition seems to imply a mental existence. If we want to assess the moral weight of something that is human, then being human would be part of the criteria, yes? If we are asessing the moral weight of cats, the fact that it is a cat would be part of the criteria. If we are just asessing what has moral weight in general, then consciousness with no reference to species would be the criteria.

Either way, Sapien should be the word you look up as Homo Sapien is two words...but since we have 5 other definitions (this includes my at home websters) then I'll take the 5 over the 1. So I guess I disagree. Did you look at your own link? 5 other definitions (sources) saying the exact same thing...not one of them says anything about brain mass. I feel like you aren't answering my question. I am weighing the moral value of a human verus a cast or other animal. Why would the charateristic ""human"" be more valuable than say a cat...assuming they both have consciousness?","why-pro-life","09:47 AM","abortion-debates","75"
