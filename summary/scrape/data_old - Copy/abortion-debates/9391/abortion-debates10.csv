"01-22-2007","9391",10,"Steeeeve","247957","I refer you to the biology book for classifying. You can't jump in on a response without the context. The question was asked how do they classify things...the answer was DNA although it used to be different. I guess I can't convince you that a sperm is not a ""member of the species homo sapien"" but biology is what it is until someone changes it. Covering your ears doesn't make something so In this case someone would just randomly claim you are not human...what would be your source for saying this person is wrong? Your pseudo langauge?","Sigma","248137","That's fine. The dictionary is not the proper tool to try to classify things, however, as you were attempting to do And you were insisting that the dictionary definition proved something. That obviously is not the case :P Neither does the dictionary saying something make it so. I'm so glad you've accepted that. It matters not a whit what the dictionary says humans are or what the fetus is. Neither can a biology book tell us what being human means , in a philosophical/moral sense. For that we would have personal beliefs and personal definitions. lol. You're calling English a pseudo language now. What is your support for this, Steve? Your personal definition? My source definitely would not be the dictionary, Steve :P That would just be idiotic. Were that my opponents only argument I would dismiss them out of hand and not bother to refute them.","why-pro-life","04:48 PM","abortion-debates","136"
"01-22-2007","9391",10,"paw_x","247961","I'm pro-choice, but I would definately say that a foetus is human, and not comparable to sperm at all. For example, after having an abortion here, I had to sign a form when I left the hospital confirming that I am aware that I had left 'human remains' in the hands of the health service so that they may be dealt with by an undertaker, and I was only 7 weeks along. [which obviously wouldn't happen if you left a sperm sample]","Sigma","248138","I see. So, because the hospital had forms that read 'human remains' that conclusively proves that the fetus is human. That's almost, but not quite, as bad as Steve's argument that because it was a certain way in the dictionary it must be so.","why-pro-life","04:51 PM","abortion-debates","137"

But what else is a foetus if not human? You have a scan at 12 weeks, you can see a human being inside you kicking its legs and wiggling about. Though that's further on than the majority of abortions, a few weeks earlier than that isn't a very long time and the foetus is developing into a human being. I wouldn't call it a baby until it's much more developed than that, but isn't it always human?","why-pro-life","06:08 PM","abortion-debates","138"
"01-22-2007","9391",10,"Steeeeve","248129","I like how you just claim a person is ""sexist"" and go to petty insults just because a person doesn't support abortion. Nevermind the fact that you have no basis for these assumptions, you just want to demean the other person...Perhaps you would like it if I called you a sexist or maybe a rapist lover? I have the same backing you for your claims. Anyway, you are getting really close to just slander (forbidden by the forum admin), I suggest all three of you calm it down as we have had many banned on here for the very tactics you use. slander /slndr/ Pronunciation Key - Show Spelled Pronunciation[slan-der] Pronunciation Key - Show IPA Pronunciation noun 1. defamation; calumny: rumors full of slander. 2. a malicious, false, and defamatory statement or report: a slander against his good name. 3.

As a women, I felt that his comments were rather demeaning and sexist. I don't call anyone anything unless it has a basis in what they have said or done. And about getting banned, lol! I'm calling it as I see it and I'm not afraid of your petty threats. Oh, and by the way, since you seem so obsessed with the dictionary, here you go: There is nothing false about my statement, therefore it is not slander. Slander is what Bush's buddies did to McCain in the Republican primaries (I think it was the primaries - whatever it is where republicans choose their candidate for president out of a group of republicans).","why-pro-life","07:05 PM","abortion-debates","139"

Therefore I am trying to ask him how we can conclusively prove the fetus is human. If the criteria is human DNA then the fetus is human like dead bodies are human and like sperm are human. Steve also wants to say that the fetus is human like you and I are human, but that would stray into the philosophical and moral realm and the criteria of DNA does not cover why we have moral weight :P","why-pro-life","07:21 PM","abortion-debates","140"
"01-23-2007","9391",10,"paw_x","248115","Sometimes having an abortion is the best option for them and their family. Financial commitments like a mortgage mean that many people need their full wage to get by, and if the mother had to go on maternity leave they would be seriously struggling and unable to feed their existing family. There are millions reasons for choosing to have an abortion and if a woman doesn't want to go through with a pregnancy, that is her decision as it's her body and her life that would be changing, and if she is unwilling to change her life she would hardly be an ideal person to become a fantastic mother. I wouldn't ever say abortion is a good thing, and in an ideal world it wouldn't be necessary, but people make mistakes and birth control is not 100% effective so it's always going to be needed.","maximus","248167","How much of a wage would your life be worth? Abortion as a safety for contraception is not a good argument. And there are many problems with artificial birth control itself.","why-pro-life","12:10 AM","abortion-debates","141"

What am I guilty of? Do you dispute that everyone on the planet would know that a fetus or embryo would be human remains?","why-pro-life","12:13 AM","abortion-debates","142"

As for the problems with birth control, are you now saying that people perhaps just shouldn't have sex at all except at times they want to concieve?","why-pro-life","03:31 AM","abortion-debates","143"

I can say the fetus is not, philosophically, a human being in the sense of having someone ""in there"". I cannot say that the fetus is not biologically human, but no one is saying that. You seem comfortable valuing what the dictionary says is human, but I determine my own moral sense. Actually it's your deal when you assume the dictionary definition has any authority in this discussion. It really doesn't, unless the question is what the dictionary definition is. And that is not the question, Steve :P So English is a personal moral language? I suppose that is true, in a sense. Then how do you know what I'm typing? lol, Steve, I would not care in the slightest if someone said I was not human according to the dictionary definition. I understand what you are typing because we're using the same language. English. You're the only one claiming we're using different languages. The dictionary has no authority over what English words mean, it merely records how people use English words. I am using English even if I do not use dictionary definitions. You're a riot :P","why-pro-life","10:48 AM","abortion-debates","146"

Um, that's why I said you don't scare me with your petty litte threats, as I know you cannot ban me as you are not a moderator. I'll let the moderators tell me if I've gone to far, and then I will abide by their decision, not yours.","why-pro-life","11:16 AM","abortion-debates","147"
