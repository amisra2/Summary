"01-18-2007","9391",8,"Steeeeve","247635","Is it not obvious? No has a certian level of development as the point where other definitions of homo sapiens suggest the modern human or ""the only surviving hominid"" The procedures for classifying are not in the dictionary..thus a biology book is what you need. Why is it called cheese? Because it is ""a solid food prepared from the pressed curd of milk "". Why is a fetus a human because ""it belongs to the species homo sapiens"". You have this idea of a new language for philosophy and I simply reject that. In the cheese example you would take ""milk"" and find a definition on that and then dig down some more until it makes no sense. Whatever happened to being reasonable? Irrelevant to what we are talking about. I reject the idea that criteria is needed in a definition (atleast to what we are referring to). no...but it would be interesting to see what you new language looks like.","Sigma","247731","I don't understand this sentence. Please clarify. You insist the fetus is human and that the dictionary definition makes it so, yet now you claim that the dictionary cannot classify what species the fetus is part of? It seems that the dictionary is not the authority on this subject you previously seemed to think it was. What is the criteria then, Steve. What objective criteria can we check about the fetus to determine whether the fetus is or is not human, biologically? Ah, but you can determine whether something is or is not milk. You are unwilling to accept the dictionary criteria for whether something is or is not a member of the species homo sapiens . Reasonable? This discussion has absolutely nothing to do with reason and everything to do with semantics . That's what you wanted, Steve. Is the dictionary the authority is it not? Of course the criteria is needed in the definition, if the dictionary is the authority over whether or not the fetus is a human. If the dictionary is not the authority, then you have no basis in claiming that because the dictionary says it then it must be so . Amazingly enough, it looks exactly like English... because it is English. Living language, Steve","why-pro-life","12:23 PM","abortion-debates","108"

Living language, Steve","Steeeeve","247769","""One has a certian level of development as the point the other definitions of homo sapiens suggest the modern human or ""the only surviving hominid"". So two different ideas. The dictionary tells us proper usage of words....such as cheese. The word human can be used to describe the fetus. To say the word human could not describe a fetus is inaccurate. Words don't make something what it is...it is what it is...words just describe. I can't believe you are really debating how language works...I thought they taught this stuff. DNA...consult a biology book for how they classify species. I actually an unwilling to accept one criteria as it conflicts with many others and the basic understanding of biology. You seem unwilling to accept everything but your own personal English language. Can you explain how you classify things in a species? It has to do with proper usage of words and playing around with them to justify abortion. This started by someone calling the fetus ""not human"". If I called you ""not a human"" and you said I was wrong would you call that debate about ""semantics""? Certainaly not. Seems you are just trying be annoying about the whole thing. I never claimed it to be an authority over anything other than defining word usage. The dictionary doesn't make something what it is. When did you get this idea. [/QUOTE]Then use it correctly. The fetus is a human...of the species homo sapien....my cat is black...my desk is made out of maple. I mean really, this shouldn't have been such a long conversation. Just don't justify abortion by saying the fetus is not a human...that is inaccurate. Would you agree? or do you propose we make a new meaning human using your ""philosophy language"". Who defines words in your world?","why-pro-life","05:10 PM","abortion-debates","109"

"01-20-2007","9391",8,"Shooterandproud","245426","I've been thinking of the reasons people go pro-choice or pro-life, and to me it seems that the pro-choice stance has overwhelming proof on their side. Lets take a look: Reasons for Pro-life: 1)Protecting the ""innocent"" baby or embryo or whatever 2)Earining brownie points in heavan I can't think of anymore, please post and i'll add to the list. Reasons for pro-choice: 1)This is a woman's body, not yours, not mine, and certainly not the governments. 2)An embryo can not make a decision, but a mother knows her circumstances best, therefore she should choose for the both. 3)An Embryo is not a sentient life form, and does not posses self awareness or consciousness, or to quote Another Opinion: ""Mentally exist"". 4)The only thing an embryo and humans have in common is a strand of DNA. 5)Abortion has some positive effects on society, as in the book Freakonomics by um... forgot the guy, Steve something, the author cites that the legalization of abortions caused a rapid decrease in crime, which makes sense if you think about it. Unwanted children are 10X more likely to become criminals. 6)And embryo does not have a 100% possiblilty of growing into a human being. 20% of pregnancies end in a miscarrige. 7)Birth control is not 100% effective. As I have said before, my friend's mom had her sister on the pill. Even though this makes up a small percentage of abortion, it still makes up some percentage, which is reason enough. 8)Being forced to carry through and unwanted pregnancy can have devastating effects on a women, namely financially and emotionally. 1)This is a woman's body, not yours, not mine, and certainly not the governments. 2)An embryo can not make a decision, but a mother knows her circumstances best, therefore she should choose for the both. 3)An Embryo is not a sentient life form, and does not posses self awareness or consciousness, or to quote Another Opinion: ""Mentally exist"". 4)The only thing an embryo and humans have in common is a strand of DNA. 5)Abortion has some positive effects on society, as in the book Freakonomics by um... forgot the guy, Steve something, the author cites that the legalization of abortions caused a rapid decrease in crime, which makes sense if you think about it.

Of course, you have not put forth the pro-life words so eloquently or elaborately. Of course, you seek to reduce our reasons to some implied childish motivation to get ""brownie points"" with God. ""But unless you become like a child you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."" Matthew 18:3 , ""I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children."" Matthew 11:25 But let's address your points specifically: Freedom is not the ultimate good of this world. Your freedom revolves only about the mother. You fail to acknowledge that there is a truth existent outside of the realm of a mother's freedom of body yet intimately related to her freedom. Your freedom operates without recognition of this truth. Outside of your freedom there is an objective truth. You neglect the truth that there is another being in the womb, a being with inherent value and dignity. This truth must be considered in all acts of freedom. Abortion is not an act of freedom but an abuse of freedom. We can put it into the context of many other abuses of personal freedom. Freedom cannot exist without truth. The mother (and often the father) obviously have to choose for both herself and her child. The question remains, though, what is a right, good choice? What is a legitimate, just choice? What is a choice that considers the full well-being of mother and child? Is the violent choice of abortion a beneficial choice in a civilized society? Lack of mental awareness or self-awareness is not a justification for killing these beings. I think the comparison and contrast is more stark. Abortion has positive effects on society? Many evils may appear to have good effects. What good does gang violence bring about? It eliminates another individual who might commit crime, it decreases the population so there is less scarcity of resources, etc. We cannot commit evil to do good. Abortion has ""positive"" effects so let's eliminate these beings and not give them a chance at living the American Dream. There are a lot of others we can eliminate to decrease crime. Why not address the real problem, the treatment and rearing of children, instead of getting rid of the children. Why not address the idea that moral actions (or immoral actions--crime) are not determined by scarcity of resources. Why not discuss the breakdown of the traditional family (who has had the responsibilitiy of educating and raising these children for thousands of years) and the effect on society resulting from this. 100% of 5 year olds do not make it to be 10 years old, 100% of 20 year olds do not make it to be 30 year olds, 100% of 50 year olds do not make it to be 65 years old. Does this justify killing them? 20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage. So let's kill some more? But abortion and miscarriage are different in kind, not degree. An active action to kill a living human being in the womb is different than a spontaneous abortion due to inability to survive. I'm not sure what you're saying here. Are you saying that due to birth control's failure, abortion is needed as a safety net? Are are you acknowledging the abortive aspects of artificial contraception? I can think of no more devastating effect than the end of life prematurely, a destruction of one's being and existence. That is what the being in the womb goes through. This is not to mention the devastating effects on women who have undergone abortion. http://www.silentnomoreawareness.org/","why-pro-life","09:30 AM","abortion-debates","112"
"01-20-2007","9391",8,"Shooterandproud","245534","1. You mean like a tapeworm? Should removing tapeworms be illegal too? 2. I don't follow you here. Can you back up your little sacred ""trust"" theory? There is no trust between an embryo and a woman. An embryo cannot feel trust, it cannot even feel itself. Its really only a hunk of cells, and saying that it trusts the woman is like me saying that the flowers in my garden trust me to water them. And, at what point does a life become ""sacred"". I'm sure you've weeded your garden, is that an embarrasing disregard for sacred life? Is hunting an embarrassing disregard for sacred life? 3. By your logic, i can call almost anything a ""sacred life"".","gman","247912","1. If I'm not mistaken, this is your thread. Was the subject tapeworms? 2. I'm not surprised that you don't follow the concept of trust a child automatically, by instinct, places in it's mom. You are assuming what an embryo can or can not feel. Due to it's inability to communicate. Are you stating that any being that can not communicate is expendable? I would bet that you would go to extremes to protect a baby seal about to get it's head bashed in by an eskimo hunter to sell it's coat. Regardless of it's inability to say I want to live. By the way, I support hunting. But I do not take killing lightly. 3. The subject of my topic is children.
