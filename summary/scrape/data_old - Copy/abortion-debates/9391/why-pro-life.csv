Lets take a look: Reasons for Pro-life: 1)Protecting the ""innocent"" baby or embryo or whatever 2)Earining brownie points in heavan I can't think of anymore, please post and i'll add to the list. Reasons for pro-choice: 1)This is a woman's body, not yours, not mine, and certainly not the governments. 2)An embryo can not make a decision, but a mother knows her circumstances best, therefore she should choose for the both. 3)An Embryo is not a sentient life form, and does not posses self awareness or consciousness, or to quote Another Opinion: ""Mentally exist"". 4)The only thing an embryo and humans have in common is a strand of DNA. 5)Abortion has some positive effects on society, as in the book Freakonomics by um... forgot the guy, Steve something, the author cites that the legalization of abortions caused a rapid decrease in crime, which makes sense if you think about it. Unwanted children are 10X more likely to become criminals. 6)And embryo does not have a 100% possiblilty of growing into a human being. 20% of pregnancies end in a miscarrige. 7)Birth control is not 100% effective. As I have said before, my friend's mom had her sister on the pill. Even though this makes up a small percentage of abortion, it still makes up some percentage, which is reason enough. 8)Being forced to carry through and unwanted pregnancy can have devastating effects on a women, namely financially and emotionally. In conclusion, I quote Mr. Richard C. Carrier: ""First, abortion is a notable benefit to society. The harm to a society that is caused by an excess of unchecked population growth is severe and well-documented. The ability of societies to check population growth without legalizing abortion has proven nearly non-existent: there are few countries in which abortion is outlawed or stigmatized that are not suffering harshly from overcrowding, with all the attendant economic, criminal, or political troubles. In contrast, most nations that allow the procedure are maintaining stable populations with nearly zero growth, and exhibiting more or less general prosperity. From a purely pragmatic perspective aimed at the interests of the commonwealth, abortion is at best a great benefit to mankind and at worst a necessary evil. And for women who regard zero growth as a moral imperative, abortion can even be a moral necessity from their point of view--although this would be better called a matter of principle, so as to distinguish this personal belief from the morally universal. Second, abortion is a significant benefit for the individual woman. The risks of death or permanent disability certainly must be greater for a woman who carries a fetus to term and bears a child, prematurely or not, than for a woman who aborts before the third trimester of her pregnancy. And the social and economic ruin that can ensue from an untimely motherhood is a serious harm as well, and although this could be alleviated by recourse to adoption, free medical care for pregnant women, and public welfare for women unable to work as a consequence of their pregnancy, these solutions are not as simple as they sound, and are not so universally available as people might think (even the United States, among the wealthiest of nations, has no such welfare system in place, not to mention a very poor excuse for a medicare system, and there is no desirable option for orphans in nations like India or Chad). Moreover, the potential physical harm from bearing a child simply cannot be alleviated. Abortion thus supplies some benefit for many women. An act that causes no involuntary harm and produces some benefits for individuals and society in general should never be outlawed. This is based on the principle that laws should only exist to preserve and protect the liberty of individuals and, when no liberty is at stake either way, to increase the general welfare of all citizens. Whether that principle is misinformed remains to be seen. But from the above analysis, there appears no way in which outlawing abortion would even indirectly preserve or protect the liberty of any individual, or provide any general benefit to the citizen body without uneccessarily depriving individuals of their liberty.""","why-pro-life","01:06 PM","abortion-debates","1"

That is good. We need population control, as overpopulation is a problem to come. I only wish it were so simple. Abortion is always ok in rape or incest hands down.

Human beings, or personhood, begins at first sign of intelligence or self awareness. There is no basis for rights without that, as it is what makes humans unique. We don't give animals the same rights as humans and animals DO have intelligence. In fact, hunting is legal, and animals do posses intellgence. So, why should something that possesses NO intelligence have more rights than lives that do? I beg to differ. I still fail to see any logic or reasoning in your argument. Embryos are not human beings. They do not posses intelligence, heck, they don't even posses limbs. They are really only a clump of floating flesh living parasitically off of its host: the woman. The only think that it and a human have in common is a strand of dna, nothing more.

You have the disadvantage here. I agree, however anti-choice is a 100% accurate way to describe pro-lifers, but anti-life is an inaccurate way to describe pro-choicers. Actually, thats not always so.

Reasons for pro-choice: 1)This is a woman's body, not yours, not mine, and certainly not the governments. 2)An embryo can not make a decision, but a mother knows her circumstances best, therefore she should choose for the both. 3)An Embryo is not a sentient life form, and does not posses self awareness or consciousness, or to quote Another Opinion: ""Mentally exist"". 4)The only thing an embryo and humans have in common is a strand of DNA. 5)Abortion has some positive effects on society, as in the book Freakonomics by um... forgot the guy, Steve something, the author cites that the legalization of abortions caused a rapid decrease in crime, which makes sense if you think about it. Unwanted children are 10X more likely to become criminals. 6)And embryo does not have a 100% possiblilty of growing into a human being. 20% of pregnancies end in a miscarrige. 7)Birth control is not 100% effective. As I have said before, my friend's mom had her sister on the pill. Even though this makes up a small percentage of abortion, it still makes up some percentage, which is reason enough. 8)Being forced to carry through and unwanted pregnancy can have devastating effects on a women, namely financially and emotionally.","Bell","246402","Here is another perspective for the prolife argument, from feministsforlife.org: ""Feminists for Life of America recognizes that abortion is a reflection that our society has failed to meet the needs of women."" Also, ""[We] believe no woman should be forced to choose between pursuing her education and career plans and ...her child"". I absolutely agree with these tenants, however I find it mildly ironic that a feminist organization wants to tell me what to do with my uterus.

The trouble is that there are really TWO definitions of the term ""a human"" - the official definition and the common-use definition. One can legitimately argue, as Steeeeve does, that the official definition of a human as a ""member of the species homo sapien"" would only require a complete set of human DNA and the beginning of the growth process - so a zygote would then qualify under the official definition. However, nearly all uses of the term ""a human"" in common discussion are on topics other than abortion, where ""a human"" is discusses as a born human and, at the very least, the assumption is made that the being in question possesses a mental existence. At least I assume that when I hear the term ""a human"" and I know that this is a very common assumption - as demonstrated by the frequent disputes about the use of this term. Therefore, the term ""a human"" automatically generates a certain amount of sympathy because of these unofficial conotations of mental existence that are added to the definition. Steeeeve: I know you might feel justified in using the term ""a human"" and trying to force pro-choice people to admit to discriminating against humans since you stand firm on the official definition. However, you have to admit that it is somewhat disingenuous of you to ignore the fact that this term has many unofficial conotations attached to it that do not apply to a zygote or embryo - mental existence being one of them. Since words, after all, are used for COMMUNICATION, the use of the word ""a human"" in this way is a purposeful distortion of the message. Can't you try to find some term that you can all agree on? Shooterandproud and ShadowPikachu: Since the official definition of ""a human"" probably does include a zygote, Steeeeve is technically right, but I fully sympathize with you that the term ""a human"" is loaded with meanings that are attached to it due to its common use. Since there exists this difference between common use and official definition, wouldn't it be better for you as well to find some term that you and Steeeeve (and other pro-life proponents) could agree on?","why-pro-life","10:28 AM","abortion-debates","35"

I choose to use the dictionary as that is our English language and human is what it is and we shouldn't change the definition just to make us feel better about abortion...that's just stupid. I disagree that mental existence applies to the term human there is nothing to support that it did. I suppose it could mean ""has mental existence"" though just like the word ""baby"" can mean newborn or a fetus. As for saying that you ""discriminate"" against humans...this is just a fact pro-choice folks are going to have to admit. I don't say this is a bad thing as I too support some form of ""discrimination"" based on certain criteria. What I don't discriminate on is develop and size and pro-choice has to.

The composite of characteristics that make up an individual personality; the self. ... and a few others that are less relevant... Anyway, the second and third definitions clearly imply mental existence. The first definition is unclear but, given the examples that they give, they seem to imply a mental existence as well.

(This is as opposed to discrimination against people based on their actions - ex. crimes - being permissible, as well as discrimination against people based on their inability to control their actions - ex. limiting the rights of children - being permissible.).

"01-10-2007","9391",4,"Another opinion","246618","Steeeeve, dislexia, Shooterandproud, and ShadowPikachu : The four of you seem to be engaged in yet another unresolveable battle of semantics - in this case about the definition of the term ""a human"". The trouble is that there are really TWO definitions of the term ""a human"" - the official definition and the common-use definition. One can legitimately argue, as Steeeeve does, that the official definition of a human as a ""member of the species homo sapien"" would only require a complete set of human DNA and the beginning of the growth process - so a zygote would then qualify under the official definition. However, nearly all uses of the term ""a human"" in common discussion are on topics other than abortion, where ""a human"" is discusses as a born human and, at the very least, the assumption is made that the being in question possesses a mental existence. At least I assume that when I hear the term ""a human"" and I know that this is a very common assumption - as demonstrated by the frequent disputes about the use of this term. Therefore, the term ""a human"" automatically generates a certain amount of sympathy because of these unofficial conotations of mental existence that are added to the definition. Steeeeve: I know you might feel justified in using the term ""a human"" and trying to force pro-choice people to admit to discriminating against humans since you stand firm on the official definition. However, you have to admit that it is somewhat disingenuous of you to ignore the fact that this term has many unofficial conotations attached to it that do not apply to a zygote or embryo - mental existence being one of them. Since words, after all, are used for COMMUNICATION, the use of the word ""a human"" in this way is a purposeful distortion of the message. Can't you try to find some term that you can all agree on? Shooterandproud and ShadowPikachu: Since the official definition of ""a human"" probably does include a zygote, Steeeeve is technically right, but I fully sympathize with you that the term ""a human"" is loaded with meanings that are attached to it due to its common use. Since there exists this difference between common use and official definition, wouldn't it be better for you as well to find some term that you and Steeeeve (and other pro-life proponents) could agree on?","Shooterandproud","246701","Thanks, but to clear some things up, I am not disputing the scientific status of the embryo. The debate is whether or not it possesses intelligence. If it does, then it deserves rights just like any other human. If it doesn't, then it doesn't deserve rights. We are trying to establish whether its a being or not, because if it is not a being or ""person"", as in possessing intelligence, then there is no reason why it should overpower a being who does.","why-pro-life","10:29 PM","abortion-debates","50"

You shouldn't worry about other people that read our back and forth conversation They will miss context no matter what as they don't read the entire conversation normally. Actually I just find it funny that people can't admit to discriminating...we all do it including me. The fact that some don't admit to it is amusing and brings up questions about whether they feel it is wrong or not deep inside. I believe we can discriminate based on sex...probably very rarely race. Men and Women are different and that requires discrimination sometimes. Take the draft for example or just simply segregation of bathrooms. Race would be a hard one but if you support affirmative action you are for discrimination. This is off topic but if you had the same approach (treat others as you wish to be treated) then if you would not want to be aborted then wouldn't it be logical to treat others the same way?

I don't really care what you decide to call a human. I will call a human whatever I like whether you complain or not, and in fact I'm willing to bet most americans would say the same. Very easily. For instance, would you give somone who has died all of the same rights as a living mentally existant human being? Of course not! And yet, they are still members of the species Homo Sapien, so by not giving them the same rights, that would be discrimination by your standards. See how the definition here is too vague? (On second thought, you probably wouldn't admit it if you did because you seem rather obsessed with the ""official definition"" ). If you look at the second and third listings in the definition another_opinion was talking about, you can see it clearly implies mental existence. Just because one definition is at the top doesn't mean it is more commonly used, it just means they had to write them out in a list. A foetus cannot be worthy of life as it does not mentally (and in many other ways) live.

We use different definitions for even common words than what any dictionary might put out to satisfy shadings of meaning that may be necessary for a certain discussion.

Of course, you have not put forth the pro-life words so eloquently or elaborately. Of course, you seek to reduce our reasons to some implied childish motivation to get ""brownie points"" with God. ""But unless you become like a child you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."" Matthew 18:3 , ""I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children."" Matthew 11:25 But let's address your points specifically: Freedom is not the ultimate good of this world. Your freedom revolves only about the mother. You fail to acknowledge that there is a truth existent outside of the realm of a mother's freedom of body yet intimately related to her freedom. Your freedom operates without recognition of this truth. Outside of your freedom there is an objective truth. You neglect the truth that there is another being in the womb, a being with inherent value and dignity. This truth must be considered in all acts of freedom. Abortion is not an act of freedom but an abuse of freedom. We can put it into the context of many other abuses of personal freedom. Freedom cannot exist without truth. The mother (and often the father) obviously have to choose for both herself and her child. The question remains, though, what is a right, good choice? What is a legitimate, just choice? What is a choice that considers the full well-being of mother and child? Is the violent choice of abortion a beneficial choice in a civilized society? Lack of mental awareness or self-awareness is not a justification for killing these beings. I think the comparison and contrast is more stark. Abortion has positive effects on society? Many evils may appear to have good effects. What good does gang violence bring about? It eliminates another individual who might commit crime, it decreases the population so there is less scarcity of resources, etc. We cannot commit evil to do good. Abortion has ""positive"" effects so let's eliminate these beings and not give them a chance at living the American Dream. There are a lot of others we can eliminate to decrease crime. Why not address the real problem, the treatment and rearing of children, instead of getting rid of the children. Why not address the idea that moral actions (or immoral actions--crime) are not determined by scarcity of resources. Why not discuss the breakdown of the traditional family (who has had the responsibilitiy of educating and raising these children for thousands of years) and the effect on society resulting from this. 100% of 5 year olds do not make it to be 10 years old, 100% of 20 year olds do not make it to be 30 year olds, 100% of 50 year olds do not make it to be 65 years old. Does this justify killing them? 20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage. So let's kill some more? But abortion and miscarriage are different in kind, not degree. An active action to kill a living human being in the womb is different than a spontaneous abortion due to inability to survive. I'm not sure what you're saying here. Are you saying that due to birth control's failure, abortion is needed as a safety net? Are are you acknowledging the abortive aspects of artificial contraception? I can think of no more devastating effect than the end of life prematurely, a destruction of one's being and existence. That is what the being in the womb goes through.

Fetal Pain: A Systematic Multidisciplinary Review of the Evidence. JAMA, 2005; 294(8): 947-54. ABSTRACT Context Proposed federal legislation would require physicians to inform women seeking abortions at 20 or more weeks after fertilization that the fetus feels pain and to offer anesthesia administered directly to the fetus. This article examines whether a fetus feels pain and if so, whether safe and effective techniques exist for providing direct fetal anesthesia or analgesia in the context of therapeutic procedures or abortion. Evidence Acquisition Systematic search of PubMed for English-language articles focusing on human studies related to fetal pain, anesthesia, and analgesia. Included articles studied fetuses of less than 30 weeks gestational age or specifically addressed fetal pain perception or nociception. Articles were reviewed for additional references. The search was performed without date limitations and was current as of June 6, 2005. Evidence Synthesis Pain perception requires conscious recognition or awareness of a noxious stimulus. Neither withdrawal reflexes nor hormonal stress responses to invasive procedures prove the existence of fetal pain, because they can be elicited by nonpainful stimuli and occur without conscious cortical processing. Fetal awareness of noxious stimuli requires functional thalamocortical connections. Thalamocortical fibers begin appearing between 23 to 30 weeks gestational age, while electroencephalography suggests the capacity for functional pain perception in preterm neonates probably does not exist before 29 or 30 weeks. For fetal surgery, women may receive general anesthesia and/or analgesics intended for placental transfer, and parenteral opioids may be administered to the fetus under direct or sonographic visualization. In these circumstances, administration of anesthesia and analgesia serves purposes unrelated to reduction of fetal pain, including inhibition of fetal movement, prevention of fetal hormonal stress responses, and induction of uterine atony. Conclusions Evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester. Little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques. Similarly, limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion. Anesthetic techniques currently used during fetal surgery are not directly applicable to abortion procedures.","thelmoose","248855","Looking at your own ultrasound is hardly the way to answer the question of the age at which fetal perception occurs.

Any of the material below, if not otherwise attributed, can be attributed to NRLC Legislative Director Douglas Johnson (Legfederal@aol.com), who prepared this memorandum. See this here: http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/Fetal_P...uttalJAMA.html The following excerpt is from: http://abort73.com/HTML/I-A-2a-pain.html ""Sir Albert Lilley, widely considered the ""Father of Fetology"", and unabashedly pro-life (as anyone with his vast knowledge of fetal development should be) makes some remarkable statements about fetal pain in an interview he conducted for the book The Tiniest Humans. Question: In the case of an 8- to-10-week fetus, if you apply pressure will it tend to try to get out of the way? Answer: Normally it would be extremely difficult, apart from putting a foreign instrument or needle into the uterus to apply pressure, but with a fetus at that maturity you have a very small fetus in a larger capsule of fluid. However, as the famous work of Dr. Davenport Hooker shows, in his many thousands of feet of film, babies at this maturity are responsive to touch. The fetus also responds violently to painful stimuli-needle puncture and injection of cold or of hypertonic solutions- stimuli which you and I find painful, children will tell you are painful, and the neonate, to judge from his responses, finds painful. --- I have been told by advocates of abortion that we have no proof that the fetus actually feels pain. Strictly, they are quite correct. Pain is a peculiarly personal and subjective experience and there is no biochemical or physiological test we can do to tell that anyone is in pain - a phenomenon which makes it very easy to bear other people's pain stoically, which is an important point for obstetricians to remember. By the same token we lack any proof that animals feel pain. However, to judge from their responses, it seems charitable to assume they do. Were this not so there would be no point in having an organization like the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and I for one would be unhappy to think we would withhold from the human fetus a charitable consideration we were prepared to extend to animals. Question: The question, then, of pain felt by the fetus - it is your personal opinion, I gather from what you say in your paper, that in effect the fetus does feel pain? Answer: I can only say that the fetus responds violently to stimuli that you and I would find painful. Bertrand Russell once remarked that a fisherman had told him that fish had neither sense or sensation, but how he knew that the fisherman would not tell him."" The following excerpt is from: http://www.theinterim.com/2000/nov/21fetalpain.html ""Dr. Glover's research in the area of fetal pain is hardly groundbreaking. Sir Albert W. Liley, the pre-eminent fetologist from New Zealand, had no doubt, on the basis of objective evidence, that the fetus has a capacity to feel pain. In 1963, Dr. Liley, the founder of fetology, developed the first surgical technique for administering intrauterine blood transfusions to the fetus. According to Liley, the fetus feels pain as early as three months . In offering instructions for carrying out the surgical technique of fetal blood transfusions, he advised his colleagues to take into serious consideration this fact of fetal pain. During the actual surgical procedure, the child must be sedated and given pain-relieving medication. Dr. Margaret Liley, wife and assistant to her husband, and a distinguished fetologist and pediatrician in her own right, remarks in her well-known book, Modern Motherhood: When doctors first began invading the sanctuary of the womb, they did not know that the unborn baby would react to pain in the same fashion as a child would. But they soon learned that he would. By no means a vegetable' as he has so often been pictured, the unborn knows perfectly well when he has been hurt, and he will protest it just as violently as would a baby in a crib. In referring to aborting a 12-week-old fetus by dilatation and curettage, (in which the neck of the womb is dilated and the fetus removed in pieces after the womb has been scraped by a sharp instrument called a curette), Dr. Eugene Diamond stated in 1971: ""When this procedure is done, there is little doubt that the fetus, in fact, feels what is done to it."" In a comprehensive treatment of fetal pain, published in 1985 in the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. K. Annand, a Harvard physiologist, stated that the fetus first perceives pain as early as 12 weeks. In a May 1975 piece in Atlantic, Willard Gaylin and Marc Lappe argue for fetal experimentation, which they contend is far less traumatic for the unborn than certain forms of abortion. If society allows a child in the womb to be subjected to ""unimaginable acts of violence,"" they write, such as ""dismemberment, salt-induced osmotic shock, or surgical extirpation,"" how can it balk at fetal experimentation, most forms of which are incomparably more benign. Fetal pain, of course, is a matter of fact, not ideology. Science, of course, should be based on fact, not political correctness. We live in a Therapeutic Culture in which popping pills has become a national pastime. We are only too sensitive about pain, inconvenience, and possibly offending someone. Yet our own ultra-sensitivity to pain does not, in general, extend to the unborn. Are we inconsistent in our war against pain? Is there a blatant contradiction that runs through the very heart of our Therapeutic Culture? The answer to this apparent dilemma lies in the fact that there are different levels of pain. Pain exists on a spiritual as well as on a physical level. Of the two, as many psychologists and psychiatrists have averred, the spiritual kind is more difficult to bear. The difference between the two is akin to the difference between pain and suffering. The suffering in one's soul that can arise from humiliation, guilt, despair, and terror, are formidable. An athlete would rather risk breaking his neck driving for a fly ball than feel the humiliation of being called a wimp. A soldier would rather risk injury and even death, than suffer the shame of dishonor. A Christian would rather mortify himself than experience the disgrace that comes with mortal sin. Defeat, dishonor, disgrace, as a rule, are far more devastating than physical pain. There is a pain that goes with being egregiously wrong (shame) or being recklessly immoral (disgrace) or being purposely obtuse (humiliation) that is more acute than physical pain. Our Therapeutic Culture is not inconsistent. Those who promote abortion want to spare themselves the pain that goes with suffering shame, disgrace, and humiliation. Because of that, they are willing to deny the pain that the aborted baby feels. To acknowledge what abortion really means is too painful for them. They would rather retreat into the presumed security of their comforting ideology. Pain and birth go together in a mysterious way, like death and life, fall and redemption. The birth of a child or the rebirth of an adult requires a certain amount of pain. Birth and redemption both demand pain. Abortion was instituted in an attempt to avoid pain. But it has magnified the very thing it had sought to reduce. We are drowning in a sea of tranquilizers while we increase our suffering. We thought we could eliminate physical suffering, but brought about spiritual torment. The abortion issue, like an ellipse, has two foci: one is the birth of the child (which is accompanied by pain); the other, the rebirth of the pro-abortionist (which is accompanied by suffering). Part of the painful truth about the abortion issue is that it includes both the unborn and the unrepentant.""

Basically I mentioned 12 weeks for my own mental health, as I had seen my daughter in a scan at that age and could picture it more. Maybe that sounds stupid but I found it extremely difficult to go through with the abortion and the less real I could make it seem, the better I felt about going through with it.

It was nothing to do with the value of the foetus to me. I do want to have more children later on. But at this time, we have just taken on a 5 year fixed rate mortgage, and if we pay it off before that time [i.e by selling the house, which is too small for 2 kids] we lose a substantial amount of money, probably wouldn't be able to afford anywhere bigger, and certainly unable to pay a high mortgage while I'd be on maternity leave, so we would probably have to wait for a council property, which would almost certainly be offered only in the deprived areas of my town as that's all that is left for rent. I don't want to go too much more into the money side of things as it seems like it's putting a price on a possible second child but I've worked hard to get my daughter out of our old rented house in a bad area and into a decent side of the town in an owned property. The 'rich aspects' don't seem as appealing when I would be living, granted with two great children, but in an area of my town where vandalism, antisocial behaviour and crime is constant, living in fear of having my daughters bedroom window smashed by two 10 year old boys, having drunk teenagers cut through my garden every weekend, and finding it difficult to even get my daughter to sleep at night because of the constant shouting and screaming of my lovely neighbours [basically the fabulous neighbourhood we lived in, offered by the housing association after I had my daughter]. I'm probably being too personal but I don't feel that my life would be very rich had I continued my pregnancy at this time in my life. I chose to have my daughter, and when I made that decision I took on the obligation of raising her well, and doing all I could for her.
