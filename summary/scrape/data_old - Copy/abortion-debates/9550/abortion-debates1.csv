"02-09-2007","9550",1,"None","None","None","Phyllis","250428","In a recent thread, I think some interest was expressed in a discussion of the United States Supreme Courts decision in Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113) . If I am mistaken as to the depth of this interest, I apologize. But I do believe that a discussion of Roe is quite important to a discussion about abortion in the United States. And it is for this reason that I decided that Roe deserves its own thread. Before going further, I wish to say something to those who reside outside of the United States. It is not uncommon in this thread for a person to point out that such-and-such only applies to the United States or some similar objection. This thread will really only apply to those residing in the United States, although I certainly would like to invite our European friends to participate if they would like to. I just want to say up front that I have intended to restrict this particular thread to an issue that probably only has significance to United States citizens. I would now like to explain my proposed methodology in this thread. Though I am not a moderator and possess no ability to ensure this thread goes forward in my intended manner, I will nevertheless express my hopes for this discussion. This thread is intended to proceed much in the same manner as a debate in the formal debate thread would proceed, with a single exception: the attitude (atmosphere) in this thread will be more of a discussion as opposed to a debate. As such, many posts might be longer than the average for the general forums. I intend to post a systematic treatise (of sorts) on Roe v. Wade . This will be done in a series of posts, and I invite questions/comments/discussion at whatever juncture would seem appropriate in the series. I do not know how frequently I will be able to add to my discussion (i.e., the longer posts), but I will try to respond to questions and/or comments whenever appropriate (i.e., in shorter follow-up posts). I have at least two reasons for starting this thread, and I will end this first post with a short explanation of those reasons. First, I believe this will be beneficial to many that contribute to the Abortion forums. Many times we focus all of our attention on our personal view of abortion (which I do believe is important), but we spend very little time on whether those personal views actually matter. I will explore this in greater detail in a post to follow. Secondly, even if nobody else is interested in this discussion, I will nevertheless benefit myself by engaging in the exercise of trying to articulate some foundational principles of Constitutional law. I have a deep personal interest in Constitutional law, and discussing some of the specifics surrounding that discipline will in the very least benefit my own understanding. I have one final thought. I do hope that this discussion will be of interest to all those who feel so stronglyone way or anotherabout abortion. That may be an ambitious desire, but I hold it sincerely. Please do offer any comments/questions/disagreements you may have with this (but especially future) posts in this thread. I look forward to this important discussion. ***[Update]*** I have kindly been given moderator privileges for this thread. This will enable the discussion to move forward, and will hopefully prevent it from moving too far off topic. ***[/Update]***","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","12:04 PM","abortion-debates","1"
"02-10-2007","9550",1,"None","None","None","Phyllis","250508","In my previous post, I suggested that one reason I started this thread is that it seems we spend a great deal of time discussing our personal view of abortion (quite appropriately so), and we spend very little time discussing whether those personal views actually matter. In this post I hope to develop this point a little more fully. After reading through these forums and viewing various abortion polling data, it appears to me that a very large majority of people would support some sort of abortion regulation once a pregnancy has reached the third trimester. But in reading polling data surrounding the question of whether the public would support the reversal of Roe v. Wade , the overwhelming majority say they would oppose such a reversal. I hope to show that these two views are contradictory to such a degree that so long as Roe v. Wade remains intact, ones personal view on the issue of abortion has no significance in the area that matters most: the formulation of law. Since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, abortion policy in the United States has been set by the Supreme Court. In holding that the Constitution protects a womans right to terminate her pregnancy, the Court effectively took the issue of abortion off of the democratic stage. Because of this decision, the personal views of the American People as to what abortion policy should be implemented at any given stage of pregnancy became insignificant. I submit as an example the case of Stenberg v. Carhart (530 U.S. 914). Nebraska enacted a law which proscribed partial birth abortion except where the procedure was necessary to save the life of the mother. The law was challenged, and in 2000, the Supreme Court issued a decision overturning that law. Given the present state of affairs regarding the Supreme Courts handling of abortion, it has become apparent that ones personal views about abortion do notin one very important sensematter at all. We will, of course, examine whether this ought to be the case in future posts. Roe stands in the way of any meaningful abortion regulation at any stage of pregnancy (as I intend to show), and those who honestly believe that some sort of protection should be given to the fetus at the third trimester should honestly desire that Roe be done away with. Please note that I have not said that this desire alone would justify or compel one to believe that Roe should be reversed by the United States Supreme Court. I only suggest that those who honestly believe that a fetus in the third trimester of pregnancy deserves some protection (and that is most of us) should pay close attention to this discussion. A discussion of Roe is necessary if we want our opinions on abortion to matter significantly, and that is why I hope to receive input as this thread moves forward.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","01:38 AM","abortion-debates","2"
"02-10-2007","9550",1,"Roe vs Wade section X","None","With respect to the State's important and legitimate interest in potential life, the ""compelling"" point is at viability. This is so because the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb. State regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological justifications. If the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion [410 U.S. 113, 164] during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.","Another opinion","250528","I do not wish to go into a full debate with you since, frankly, my knowledge of legal jurisprudence is quite limited and it is of low priority for me to spend a lot of time researching it for such a debate. I would leave that to people more knowledgeable and interested in legal theory. However, it is important for me to point out that Roe vs. Wade does allow for states to limit a womans right to abortion in the third trimester.

I just doubt that many people here have heard, let alone understand, the concept of substantive due process or other legal terms like that.

"02-13-2007","9550",1,"None","None","None","Another opinion","250866","I just want to note that, if the US Constitution was clear cut and easy to interpret, then it would suffice to have had administrative clerks on the Supreme Court, not well educated and well experienced Judges. I, as nearly all others, may have little or no background in legal theory (nor particular interest for that matter) but the justices on the Supreme Court obviously do and there are at least two views held by these experts (which, I should note, none of us are in this thread) about how the Constitution should be interpreted. My knowledge of legal theory may be quite limited but I frankly place far more credence in the views of justices that are far more highly educated in this field than any of us, than I do in either of your opinions. I may personally prefer one philosophy over another in that the philosophies that justices follow partly determines their decisions. My only input, as an American citizen, is to vote my conscience in this matter in elections for the US Congress and president - who in turn either choose or approve the next justices. As for Roe vs Wade, you still have yet to prove that Roe vs Wade is being used to block all third trimester abortion bans. From the things I have read, the great majority of abortion bans post-Roe were far too general and/or full of slippery slope manipulations and that is why they were blocked.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","10:26 AM","abortion-debates","12"

Now, if you have an evolving constitution then I agree...it is insanely complicated. You never know what the constitution means. In fact, it is hard to ever make a law as the supreme law (ie the boundries) are changing all the time! MODES OF CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION 1. ORIGINAL INTENT, aka Original History, intended meanings of words - the reasoning behind this approach is that the framers carefully debated and chose their words precisely to produce neutral principles of law. Advocates claim it fosters consistency and stability in law, and keeps rights that exist today from ever disappearing tomorrow. Critics claim that it can be easily used to disguise ideological ends, that the framers were not of one mind, and historical records are lost. The doctrine of original intent was used in Hustler v. Falwell (1988) to find that cartoon parodies are a form of protected First Amendment expression. Intent of the framers is also the logic behind reasonable expectation of privacy in Katz v. U.S. (1967). Another place where the doctrine is framed is over whether capital punishment is cruel and unusual, as those words were used by the writers of the Eighth Amendment. The leading proponents of original intent are Justice Stevens and to a lesser extent, Justice Ginsburg. 2. TEXTUALISM, aka Literalism, Plain Words approach, ordinary meanings of words - this approach doesn't look any further than the words of the Constitution itself; it doesn't try to infer any intended meanings. The reasoning is that justices should take the words as written and promulgated to the people of the United States. A pure textualist, or literalist, approach looks for key phrases like ""Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech"" and finds that no law means no law. Reading the Constitution literally is also called strict construction. Other strands of textualism try to understand what the words would have meant to the people at the time they were written. Advocates claim it produces value-free jurisprudence and keeps justices in touch with the people. Critics claim it leads to inconsistent decision making, and represents a static, non-living document view of the Constitution. Textualism is often found in Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment cases involving criminal procedure when the Court decides to go off in some new expansionist or restrictionist direction. Textual analysis was present in Coy v. Iowa (1988) which struck down a system in which child witnesses could testify behind a screen. The leading proponent of textualism is Justice Scalia and to a lesser extent, Justice Rehnquist. 3. PRECEDENT, aka Stare Decisis, look at previously decided cases - this is the doctrine of stare decisis (let the decision stand) which means that the Supreme Court looks at its own past decisions. Technically, all courts are bound to follow the rule of law in all previous decisions by higher courts (the Supreme Court being no exception), in what is called the holding. The holding of a case is the opposite of dictum, what is irrelevant to decide a case. For example, if a case involves overturning a confession police obtained from a mentally retarded person, the part about the person being mentally retarded would be the dictum, and the rule that police should not obtain confessions from any mentally challenged person would be the holding. Advocates claim that precedent serves as a clear-cut guide, makes interpretation predictable, and keeps the Court from reversing itself. Critics claim that precedent is used as a weapon rather than guide, justices often pick and choose which precedents they like, and that the Supreme Court has generated so much precedent that support for any conclusion is possible. Precedent is often used as a rationale to limit the rights of criminal defendants. The leading proponents of precedent today are Justice Rehnquist and to a lesser extent, Justice O'Connor. Precedent was present in the reasoning behind the famous desegregation case of Brown v. Board of Education (1954), although that case also involved social scientific testimony that Justices who follow precedent don't always favor. 4. LOGICAL, aka Mathematical, put words into logic formulas - this is the approach that justices ought to engage in formal reasoning, usually in the form of a syllogism, a type of logic which draws a conclusion from a major and minor premise. Advocates claim that it gives legal reasoning a scientific justification. Critics claim that minor premises are often faulty and lead to invalid conclusions. Currently, there are no Supreme Court justices that use this method. The most famous case to use logical reasoning is Marbury v. Madison (1803) which created the right of judicial review. 5. PRUDENTIALISM, aka Doctrinal, if appropriate for adversary process - this is a common approach found throughout the court system. What every prosecutor knows is that you only try cases you can win with, look good in court with, and call forth established doctrines or rules of law. The Supreme Court is no exception. It avoids unfamiliar ground, but in some cases will decide on a case very carefully and thoroughly simply in order to allow important legal arguments to be heard, to enhance the prestige of the Court, and to clarify important doctrines. It's unknown how many Supreme Court justices explicitly adhere to this approach, but whenever you get lengthy opinions that cover a wide range of subjects and doctrines, you know its being used. An example is Baker v. Carr (1962) which was a judicial review over legislative redistricting case involving the political question doctrine, the Equal Protection clause, standing, and justiciability. 6. STRUCTURALISM, aka Aspirational, if maintains social order - this is a Constitution as ""living document"" approach which looks at each and every case as unique, and is more concerned with remedy-making than rule-making. More case specific than philosophical, this method usually results in a balancing test, matching the powers of government on one side and the rights of individuals on the other side. It's unknown how many Supreme court justices use this method, but it's assumed the logic behind the famous abortion case Roe v. Wade (1973) is the idea of a living constitution.","Another opinion","250941","Perhaps I was misinterpreting what the two of you were saying, but it sounded like you thought that there was only one right way to interpret the Constitution and that was the literal interpretation. That is what I was arguing against. Indeed, apparently there are several approaches which judges have used in interpreting the Constitution (which I learned recently from the following Blog that I found from Google searching: http://faculty.ncwc.edu/TOConnor/410/410lect02.htm , which appears to be a few years old but is still relevant). Quoting from that site, and sorry for the legth: I only post this to note that there is no one RIGHT way to interpret the Constitution. Since the result of Constitutional interpretation depends a lot on which of these approaches a judge chooses to take, the only input that we, as citizens, can have on the process is to vote our conscience in presidential elections and elections for Congress - which ultimately determine the choice and approval of judges.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","10:32 AM","abortion-debates","14"
"02-14-2007","9550",1,"None","None","None","Phyllis","250945","There is an opinion that appears to be pervasive. That opinion is that a regular person cannot understand the complexities of Constitutional law. It is suggested that Constitutional interpretation is so complex and so intricate that one really needs to be an expert in legal theory if he wishes to understand the Constitution itself, as well as the interpretation of that document. In this post, I will examine this position. I will argue that the Constitution can be understood by ordinary (that is, non-lawyerly) people. When the delegates of the Constitutional Convention recommended the Constitution to the several states for ratification, some members of the delegation anticipated that the new plan would be heavily opposed. One of those members, Alexander Hamilton, decided to take on a project to defend the charter that was produced at the Convention. His plan was to write a series of papers in favor of adopting the Constitution. After securing the help of John Jay and James Madison, these papers were printed in the popular press, and collectively they would become known as The Federalist . The Federalist was addressed to the People of the State of New York. It is safe to assume that in 1787just as in our daymost of the population was comprised of non-lawyers. Yet Hamilton, Madison, and Jay wrote to these ordinary citizens anyway. Why would they do this if these citizens were incapable of understanding the Constitution? The answer is quite simple I think. Constitutions are written by the people and are adopted by the people. Hamilton knew that understanding the Constitution was a pre-requisite to adopting the Constitution, and thus if a Constitution is to be adopted by the general public, the general public must necessarily understand what it is they are adopting. We see this borne out in our day as well. Take, for example, the many states that have adopted amendments to their respective Constitutions in recent years (I am thinking specifically of the various marriage amendments). To my knowledge, every one of these Amendments were submitted directly to the people in a vote. Before those amendments were ratified, they had to be approved by the people, and they had to give their consent before it was adopted. It therefore seems strange to assert that the general public would give their consent to a legal text that they did not understand. Would you vote for a Constitutional Amendment that was written in a language that you did not know? So too would we expect the general population to reject an amendment that they did not understand. I have found that it is more likely than not that the person leveling the charge that the Constitution cannot be understood by the general public has never read the Constitution through in its entirety. I think that this is very problematic, and I will now spend a moment trying to convince those who have never read the entire Constitution to read it. I would agree that it is impossibleor in the very least, difficultfor a person to understand the Constitution if he has never read it in its entirety. By not having read that document, one is setting himself up to fall prey to those abuses which the Constitution was established to prevent. Suppose you find yourself subject to an interrogation in a criminal investigation. Do you know what can and cannot be done to and by you? Do you know whether you have to provide the information solicited or not? Do you know whether you even have to remain in the interrogation or not? Now, one may say, Oh, if I find myself in that situation, I will just wait for a lawyer. But suppose you find yourself in that situation and you find that you are denied a lawyer. What then? This happens several times a year, and the result is that many individuals lives are impacted forever. And that impact is usually negative. I humbly suggest that everyone take the time to read the Constitution in its entirety at least once. I just recently did this again, and it took me about 30 minutes. That may seem like too much time to invest, but I have found the benefits of doing so to be vast, and the consequences of not doing so to be potentially devastating. The Articles of the Constitution can be found here , and the Amendments can be found here . I seriously hope you will consider reading them soon.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","11:02 AM","abortion-debates","15"
