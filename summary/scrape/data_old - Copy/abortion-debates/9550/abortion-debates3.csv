It just says you are secure in those three things against unreasonable search and seizure. You obviously do not have an absolute right to be secure in those three things.

The constitution doesn't say ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and being secure in their persons is more important than houses which is more important than effects but less important that papers "". You make the classic mistake many people do...you do not want to accept the law as it stand so you choose to try and manipulate it to say whatever you want instead of just passing another law. Would you be willing to admit that you would rather the court decide what you think is right rather than have them decide what the law actually says?","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","10:11 AM","abortion-debates","36"

"04-29-2007","9550",3,"Steeeeve","250785","I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that not many people are going to question on this thread as they know it is out of their league. Of course if the Supreme Court does overturn Roe and Casey then you will certainly see many people complain about how the court did the wrong thing...even though they knowingly don't understand the constitution (which is not always a bad thing...that is why we have lawyers). I just doubt that many people here have heard, let alone understand, the concept of substantive due process or other legal terms like that. Just look at the last thread where people did not understand that the same process to make slavery ok was the same legal process that made abortion ok...yet we reject the process for one and support it for the other .","Caprii","260854","Abortion is NOT a constitutional right, the ""male"" dominated supreme court in 1973 in essence took the constitution and try to squeeze a square into a smaller circle. Ending Slavery on the other hand IS in the constition, and is a constitutional right to be ""free"". An amendment specifically written to abolish slavery. (#13) No place in the constitution, at anytime in American history, did or does the constitution permit the termination of a human life. Just because the U.S. Supreme court in its mind determined they could use a couple of words and ""bend"" them to fit ""their needs, and allowed the gross genocide of 40 millian americans and counting. To this day, abortion is NOT a constitutional right, only judical law. Now, if the country wants to make abortion specifically a constitutional right, they can do just that, they just need 2/3 congress and 3/4 of the states to agree and there you go, a new constitutional amendment. Our judges do NOT make constitutional law. No other debate in history that I'm aware has a side that debates on the ""non-issues"". Pro-choicers say ""its all about choice"", forgetting the real issue WHY women have abortions. Imagine 1 million women dying every year to self-induced starvation to be like the ultra-thin models, or ""afraid of being fat"" and therefore starve themselves. Are we just going to stand there and say ""its all about choice"" or are we going to address the issues. No woman of ""right-mind"" would starve herself to death for an image, and no mother, or ""right-mind"" would kill her unborn child. But they do so out of ""fear"", all types of fear, that society has influenced upon them, and instead of addressing the ISSUES, certain people just say ""its a matter of choice what a woman does to her body""....its a bunch of BS! Women, I beg of you to help women become stronger women. Don't buy into the propaganda, don't buy into the #### slogans of ""pro-choice"", because who in the H E L L isn't about choice and don't buy into the #### slogan ""pro-life"" because who in the H E L L is for death. For gosh sakes strengthen women by addressing the ISSUES!","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","05:54 PM","abortion-debates","38"

Pro-choice people don't cause women to desire abortion, nor would we ever stand in the way of addressing the issues that make women desire abortion. Truth be told, disallowing abortion sweeps the problem under the rug. You cannot address the problems women have that drive them to consider abortion if the entire abortion issue is off the radar (as it would almost necessarily be if it were illegal).","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","06:36 PM","abortion-debates","39"

There are those here who purport to know something about constitutional law. For the benefit of those of us who know less, could we be more explicit in our arguments when discussing more esoteric aspects? Quoting prior cases by name only is not very helpful in educating all of us. If we refer to Casey v. Roe, for example, it would be helpful if a brief explanation about what exactly the court was saying in that decision came along as well. I have been trying repeatedly in the other thread about the recent Court decision to understand what the legal issues are, but I haven't seen that. Is this a reasonable request?","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","10:30 PM","abortion-debates","42"

One problem that I foresee, however, is that there is likely to be dispute over case summaries--especially if those summaries are limited in their nature. I for one think that it would be useful to read the decision in Roe in its entirety for various reasons. First of all, it will help even the novice understand what is perhaps the United States' most notorious and disputed court decision in history (rivaled only by Dred Scott v. Sandford , the slavery case). And secondly, it will help in the direct discussion of this thread. Now, I realize that there are various reasons why one would not be able to read it, and thus I will do my best to give a fair explanation where I think it appropriate. I pointed out in one of my posts that I think the Constitution can be understood by the average (non-lawyer) citizen, and it is my intention in this discussion to assume that most of us are average people.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","10:41 PM","abortion-debates","43"
"04-30-2007","9550",3,"None","None","None","Phyllis","260896","***[Note]*** This is the fourth installment of a lenthy discussion I began some time ago. You may find the previous installments as follows: Part 1 , Part 2 , Part 3 . ***[/Note]*** The chances are that if you are reading this thread, you have an opinion about abortion. Some view it as either morally right, or else morally wrong, according to various standards of measurement. The purpose of this post is to establish some ground work for what it is we are actually discussing in this thread. The question we are moving toward is this: was Roe v. Wade correctly decided? There is an interesting observation that can be made simply from that question. The question implicitly suggests that it is possible for the Supreme Court to have decided Roe v. Wade incorrectly. That being the case, it would behoove us to try and at least narrow what we mean when we say the Supreme Court has decided a case incorrectly. Supreme Court decisions have consequences. When Roe v. Wade was decided, one of the consequences was that the states were no longer allowed to forbid physicians from performing elective abortions (we will discuss this in more detail at a later time). Immediately after this decision was handed down, multitudes of people either applauded it or condemned it according to, basically, two principles. I wish to discuss these principles and whether they amount to appropriate (or legitimate) principles of evaluating judicial decisions. The Moral Measurement Some agree or disagree with the Courts decision in Roe based upon whether they believe abortion to be morally permissible or morally repugnant. Thus, some applaud the decision because they find the result to be moral, while others condemn the decision because they find the result to be immoral. While this might be a perfectly legitimate reason to applaud (or condemn) legislative decisions, I contend that it is a wholly illegitimate reason to applaud (or condemn) judicial decisions. Let us examine this with an example in the negative. It is easy to conceive of an instance where we would think something to be immoral while at the same time admitting that it is permitted by the Constitution. The example of slavery illustrates the point. Suppose that in 1820, person X believed that slavery was grossly immoral. Nevertheless, it is abundantly clear that slavery was in fact permitted under the US Constitution in 1820. Therefore, it is not the case that every moral blight is forbidden by the Constitution. In short, something may be at once both a gross injustice, yet an injustice that is permitted by the Constitution. The Legal Measurement Adherents to the legal measurment, while they may have a personal viewpoint with respect to abortion, nevertheless believe that their personal opinion ought not to play any role in evaluating judicial decisions. For these rascals (of which I am one) it is necessary to have an understanding of the Constitution itself, as well as a theory of how it ought to be interpreted. It is only then that a judicial opinion can be properly evaluated. An interesting thing to point out in closing this post is that it is not an infrequent thing to find adherents to the legal measurement who believe abortion should be allowed (for whatever reason), but that nevertheless believe that it is not protected by the Constitution. It is also not an infrequent thing to find adherents to the legal measurement who believe that abortion should not be allowed (for whatever reason), but nevertheless believe it to be permitted by the Constitution. In summary, it is my view that the question of whether Roe v. Wade was correctly decided is neither satisfactorily nor legitimately answered by deciding whether you personally like (or dislike) abortion. To legitimately answer that question, it is necessary to look to the language and history of the Constitution itself.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","12:08 AM","abortion-debates","44"
