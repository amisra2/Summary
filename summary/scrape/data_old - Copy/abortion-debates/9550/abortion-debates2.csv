I have gone back and added titles to my lengthier posts so that they can be easily recognized as part of my larger discussion. I simply gave them numbers corresponding to their respective order. The first post, however, does not have a number because it carries the title of the thread.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","11:05 AM","abortion-debates","16"
"02-14-2007","9550",2,"Another opinion","250941","Perhaps I was misinterpreting what the two of you were saying, but it sounded like you thought that there was only one right way to interpret the Constitution and that was the literal interpretation. That is what I was arguing against. Indeed, apparently there are several approaches which judges have used in interpreting the Constitution (which I learned recently from the following Blog that I found from Google searching: http://faculty.ncwc.edu/TOConnor/410/410lect02.htm , which appears to be a few years old but is still relevant). Quoting from that site, and sorry for the legth: I only post this to note that there is no one RIGHT way to interpret the Constitution. Since the result of Constitutional interpretation depends a lot on which of these approaches a judge chooses to take, the only input that we, as citizens, can have on the process is to vote our conscience in presidential elections and elections for Congress - which ultimately determine the choice and approval of judges.","Steeeeve","250949","Oh there is a right answer and thus a better way to approach the question. The first three are not really different and really are just minor variations on the other. Precedent, I guess, goes with the 2 but is more of a rule of consistent views as opposed to a way to look at the constitution. Anyway, the people that set up our judicial system had a method in mind...a method that was basically used for the first 100+ yrs before the ""living constitution"" came along. If you argue that the role of a judge should change over time then you argue for the idea that words have no meaning and rules have no authority. There is no question that judges use different approaches but it very clear to me that one approach is the best method to follow what our constitution was set up to do. The federalist papers talk about, the constitution speaks of it, and judges did it for over 100 yrs. I can't think of a more definite approach to things than that.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","11:16 AM","abortion-debates","17"
"02-14-2007","9550",2,"Phyllis","250945","The Federalist was addressed to the People of the State of New York. It is safe to assume that in 1787just as in our daymost of the population was comprised of non-lawyers. Yet Hamilton, Madison, and Jay wrote to these ordinary citizens anyway. Why would they do this if these citizens were incapable of understanding the Constitution? The answer is quite simple I think. Constitutions are written by the people and are adopted by the people. Hamilton knew that understanding the Constitution was a pre-requisite to adopting the Constitution, and thus if a Constitution is to be adopted by the general public, the general public must necessarily understand what it is they are adopting. I humbly suggest that everyone take the time to read the Constitution in its entirety at least once. I just recently did this again, and it took me about 30 minutes. That may seem like too much time to invest, but I have found the benefits of doing so to be vast, and the consequences of not doing so to be potentially devastating. The Articles of the Constitution can be found here , and the Amendments can be found here . I seriously hope you will consider reading them soon.","Steeeeve","250954","We also have a set of Anti-Federalists papers which were the responses to which the federalist papers were written (a debate on the forums of the day if you will). One might argue that this shows that no one knew the exact same meaning of the constitution. This is not true. They both understand the meaning but the anti-federalists were afraid that the meaning would go away and the constitution would be abused by the government. This kinda led to the 10 amendment which were much different from the constitution as written. The constitution says what the government CAN do why the 10 amendments (bill of rights that is) are things the government cannot do. The anti-federalists argued that if you don't specifically say you can't do it then the government will just assume the power. When talking about the judges they suggested that judges might assume more power as there is nothing there to stop them. My point here is that the anti-federalist papers were not an argument of interpretation but rather an argument of abuse of original meaning and what that might led to. Just this example alone should led one to believe that there is one best method for looking at the constitution. I prefer http://usconstitution.net/const.html In the end, the only way you get a complicated constitution is if you say the constitution has no static meaning.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","11:30 AM","abortion-debates","19"

I personally don't take much interest in debating which one is right since (1) we will accomplish nothing by such a debate since there is apparent justification for judges to hold the variety of stances, (2) its connection to the abortion debate is VERY indirect and (3) I simply am not personally interested in going into the details of legal theory because I personally have negligible interest in such discussions and find no motivation to research the background in any more detail than a few minute search (which would lead to a poor level of discussion on my part). Anyway, I am opting out of a detailed discussion of legal theory for the reasons mentioned above. Hopefully, someone interested in that detail of legal theory will take you up on it but I suggest that it be taken out of the Abortion forum into a more appropriate one.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","11:38 AM","abortion-debates","20"

I doubt you would say a judge the declared a constitutional amendment unconstitutional would be doing his job correctly. Likewise a cookie maker baking bread would not reasonably be called a cookie maker even if you can't shut his store down for being wrong. In the legal sense of this thread it is very direct. A nonliving constitution doesn't yield the result reached in Roe...a living constitution goes either way (and in roe went pro-abortion). That is not a big deal...but for the sake of this debate the idea of a living constitution is wrong and that needs to be established. Well, it has everything to do with Roe v. Wade and that belongs in the abortion forum. You have to establish an understanding of how the constitution works before you can declare a decision to be invalid. If you accept a living constitution then Roe v. Wade is not wrong nor is it right...it just depends on how many judges you can get up there.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","11:49 AM","abortion-debates","21"
"04-26-2007","9550",2,"Phyllis","250962","I have yet to say anything about Constitutional interpretation. I have only done three things: (1) suggested that a discussion of Roe v. Wade is important, (2) elaborated why I think it is important, and (3) suggested that the Constitution can be understood by ordinary citizens. That is all I have done thus far.","Sigma","260486","Is there anything further about Roe you feel needs discussing?","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","06:12 PM","abortion-debates","23"

The fact that they are is not even disputed. If we are going to ask questions, let's at least ask questions that have some relationship to reality. The real question, in this instance, is what does the 4th Amendment mean? More broadly it would be: what does the Constitution mean? Does it mean that women have the right to abortion? That is a question that has been asked and is worth addressing.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","12:24 PM","abortion-debates","27"

An example would be forced medications and prevention for having 'bizzarre' elective surgery like an amputation (yes there are people with this sort of fetish who'd desire such). Women will stop being meat when they STOP taking their mates last name in traditional marriages. Personally, we'd be better off with males following a Patrilinear line and females following Matrilinear except in grey areas like lack of a parent. Then they could either follow the line of the surviving parent or the missing persons grand parents.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","01:55 PM","abortion-debates","30"
