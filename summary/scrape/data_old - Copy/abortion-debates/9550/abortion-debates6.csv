"05-02-2007","9550",6,"Steeeeve","261359","yet Sigma is arguing that one apple could be called Granny Smith one day and Delicious the next. And this is one of the ""rational"" ways to interpret? But how do you go from ""vague and unambiguously"" to ""has no one meaning"". Well, Sigma thinks they mean whatever we want them to mean.","Sigma","261364","If it is vague and ambiguous as to what kind of apple it is, then opinions may differ on what kind of apple it is. One Judge may think it is one, another Judge may think it's another. It is within their power to decide this. It has no definite meaning if it is vague. Thus opinions over the meaning differ.

That is correct, just like an interpretor interprets a person and his/her meaning. So unless something changed the constitution or changed the person...how does meaning change?

Rather, I intend to go through a bit of history regarding the Constitution with appropriate citations to authoritative sources. That takes considerably more time then just saying what I think. But I did want to interject something in the course of the conversation that has been taking place. I think an interesting thing to note here is that this statement leads me to believe that you want steeeve to interpret your words to have the meaning that you intended them to have. That is to say, you have an idea that you are trying to communicate to steeeeve, and when you say that he misunderstands your view, an assumption is that your statements have objective meaning which he is supposed to discover. In other words, in order to misunderstand something, there has to be an understanding that is correct (i.e., an objective meaning). Perhaps you may not agree here, to which I would be interested in why you disagree. But if you agree, a question that might emerge is this: how is it that words have objective meaning in the course of normal conversation, but that they may not have objective meaning in Constitutional texts? Note: I have not stated my own view on this matter yet, but I wanted to raise this question.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","04:35 PM","abortion-debates","79"

"05-02-2007","9550",6,"Another opinion","261384","The way I understand Sigma, the comparison would be more similar to the following scenario. Say you are a customer in a restaurant and ask the waitress for an apple. You have in mind what most of us have in mind when we think of apple. However, the waitress brings you a crabapple. You might say to her ""of course, I didn't mean crabapple when I asked for an apple"" but she would have no way of knowing that except for her interpretation. If you had been from parts of the country where people love crabapples, then her interpretation would have been correct. If you were not specific enough, then it is your own fault if someone interprets incorrectly. You never imagined that anyone would bring you a crabapple instead of a standard apple so you never felt the need to specify further. Similarly, there are situations that the founders never imagined (how can anyone imagine certain situations that will arise 200 years from now) so they were not specific enough in explaining their intent in various phrases of the Constitution. That is why a judge needs to try to understand their intent from a combination of rational interpretation of the phrase, historical context, the limitations of that contex and how that would be revelant today. I was surprised to learn once that the guillotine was invented to be a humane form of execution - since the criminal dies nearly instantaneously. Firing squad is also quite fast. I would agree that the founders probably did not disapprove of capital punishment completely, but who knows if they would have approved of the electric chair or gasing - which often cause more suffering than the old methods. There is some controversy about the suffering caused by lethal injection as well. Even given historical context, there is room for interpretation. Also, the original phrase in the Constitution may or may not have had one meaning. If the writers were in disagreement, then the compromise text might have been interpreted slightly differently by each of the writers themselves. If the writers were in good agreement, then there probably was one meaning to the text. Even then, there could well be scenarios that they never imagined and therefore didn't make previsions for in the text. Either way, if they did not sufficiently specify, one would have to try to interpet what they meant based on rational discourse and historical context. That leaves room for a limited variation in interpetations. I don't know why you are arguing extremes here. Perhaps it is because you are frustrated with this whole discussion. Either way, I think that you would have to agree that there is a gray region between the writers of the Constitution being: 1) Incompetent fools who don't know what they were doing. and 2) Perfect humans who were in perfect agreement, imagined all scenarios that could occur in the present or future and included provisions for them in their text, and wrote language that was so brilliantly clear that the meaning would be obvious to everyone. The founders were men of impressive intellect for their time and, in many ways, for all times. They were well read (more so than most any other generation) and had a good understanding of many of the traps and difficulties that nations face in their internal and external politics. However, they were also men limited by the ignorance of their time (as in their approach to slavery and the abilities of African Americans), disagreed on many issues and, as with most men of power, subject to biases based on self-interest or the interests of their constituency. The Constitution is an excellent document but it is not perfect. Justices are needed to interpret it because of its imperfect nature. Again, they generally knew what they were doing but they were fallable humans after all - not perfect god-like creatures. As with Sigma's example of the interpretation of a rule against drugs really meaning a rule against recreational drugs, there were phrases in the Constitution that were written without the benefit of knowledge of significant future changes. It is not always easy to interpret how the founders would have reacted if they had known of the future changes. There is also the question of whether to take the attitutes of the founder's day as the ideal attitudes to emulate. After all, half of the founders believed that slavery was just. It depends on how broadly you define that method.","Steeeeve","261389","And yet this is not the question. You assume that 1) the proper meaning cannot be found (although you oddly imply that a proper meaning does exist) and 2)That since no proper meaning can be found you can make up meaning and even change it as you feel. You seem to be missing the question. New inventions is not the question...even more so in our case of abortion. And you have no proof of this even when we have reason to believe otherwise. Furthermore, you still go from despair of no meaning to allowing changing meanings (if you agree with Sigma) which makes no sense. Great, that answered nothing. All you have stated is that you think the founders might be in disagreement yet you have no evidence of this but do have evidence to the contrary. I don't argue that every question can be found in a matter of seconds but I do argue that 1) there is a correct meaning and 2) There is a best method for trying to figure that out. What Sigma is arguing is that there is no better method to figure out the true meaning and this doesn't matter because the true meaning doesn't matter. Finally, she argues that the meaning changes (ie it is a living document) You misrepresent the drug letter by the parent. The only point of that is the only information you have would be to conclude that marijuana was something you shouldn't do. I doubt you would argue that because the meaning might be hard to find that you just make up a meaning. Furthermore, how do you suggest that this makes it so the meaning can change? You say half the founders believed slavery to be ok...and the constitution supported this. Did judges go ""well, thats a bad idea so lets get rid of slavery"". No, we have a way to change the constitution. Well can you explain how the method of taking a meaning that you feel best applies to todays society (in other words not even seeking what the original meaning might be) and then that meaning can even change is better or even reasonable? Just imagine if contracts worked that way...","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","05:32 PM","abortion-debates","83"
"05-02-2007","9550",6,"Another opinion","261396","Sometimes the original meaning is clear and obvious. Sometimes it is not. If it is not, then sometimes one can figure out the meaning from historical context. Sometimes, historical context does not help because, as with the medical use marijuana example, it would be hard to know how the founders would have reacted to the new situation. You have no justification for claiming that I hold this view. If you think that you do have justification, than support that with quotes from my text. You seemed to be saying that, from historical context, one can pinpoint one exact meaning. That was what I was arguing against in this section of my post. By the way, where abortion is concerned, abortion was legal up to the point of quickening during colonial times and the early years of the US (starting to be more limited around the 1820s). So, historical interpretation of abortion issues would probably work against you here. Also, once again, just because I claim that there can be various valid interpretations of a vague text does not mean that there were various original meanings. If you DON'T KNOW the exact original meaning or intent because of vagueness of the text or because of a new significant scenario that would never have been imagined in the founder's day, then you have to use all the tools you have to make an interpretation of the original intent - including using logic, historical context, etc. You are continuing to miss our points. Neither Sigma nor I claim that there were widely ranging meanings or intents in the text of the Constitution. The original meanings that the founders had in mind were probably either quite specific or had some small variation (if they were a compromise solution). What we are claiming is that often the meaning or original intent is not clear and one has to interpret as best one can. Since we cannot go back in time and read their minds, our imperfect means of making such interpretations would naturally lead to a variety of interpretations. Also, what specifically are you claiming that I have no proof of? I think almost all historians know of the disagreements between the founders about the issue of slavery. Also, Hamilton even argued against a Bill of Rights being introduced to begin with. Also, founders differed as to the degree of power of the central government vs the power of state governments. These are all well known disagreements. I am surprised that you are not familiar with them. I am sure that I could find many, many more if I took the trouble of looking. I don't think that Sigma is arguing that the original meaning doesn't matter or that living document means that you can have any interpretation as you like. I am still hoping that Sigma will respond to this to clear up misunderstandings. You might also have some record of complaints on the part of the parent as to why they disapprove of drugs. I admit that I do not know enough about the specific treatment of African Americans by the early Constitution. If the lower status of blacks was specifically spelled out in the Constitution, then the change in their status would have to be made through legislature and ammendment. If, however, their status was not specifically spelled out but it was assumed by people, at the time of the founding, that rights ascribed to men did not apply to blacks, then later times (when blacks were recognized as men just like everyone else) could have allowed a judge to use the new interpretation to claim laws against blacks unconstitutional.","Steeeeve","261408","This doesn't speak to changing of meanings. You started off by defending Sigma. The assumption is that we were going on that. If you don't hold the view that meaning changes then you either have to hold the view that meaning comes from what the writers wrote or that meaning comes from a judges personal viewpoint. from historical context and original meaning you can figure most every meaning...more meanings than any other approach ever could. To quote Justice Scalia ""my way gives you most of the answers the other way gives you none"". The constitution doesn't speak to every situation. The point was only that abortion was not some new thing. Not part of the question here. I know...Sigma thinks they are irrelevant. You do not need to read minds as you only need to read what they wrote. Some justices even use dictionaries of that time. Seems like a good way to get answers. That the adopters of the constitution thought certain parts of the constitution meant different things (from each other). And? There was no disagreement on what the constitution said about it. Thus the 13th amendment. Yeah, he did. Probably a wise move on his part. Again this shows nothing. Yet this doesn't matter. The fact that they had disagreements doesn't mean they wrote a constitution where they disagreed on what they wrote. They compromised and made it law. living document means that provisions of the constitution change to keep up with the ""evolving standard decency that mark the progress of a maturing society"". So the death penalty might be ok today but not tomorrow. This is not up for dispute. These comments are the exact reason why you get into your idea of how the constitution works. You infer something and then make conclusions based on that. My example only had two facts. You don't get to infer facts to come up with different judgments. In any event you still went and did a historical analysis to figure out the true meaning...one that doesn't change. The 3/5th compromise is something you should know. No, and this is evidenced by the 19th amendment that gave the woman the right to vote. No judge assumed the right to vote applied to woman because it never meant that even though it didn't specifically say ""woman can't vote"".","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","07:32 PM","abortion-debates","86"
"05-02-2007","9550",6,"Sigma","261392","Yay for you, you have an opinion. Interpreters have to decide the meaning of the words in order to relay that meaning","Steeeeve","261410","You play with words again. Decide doesn't mean ""make up what you feel the meaning should be"". It means you understand the meaning of the person that said it and relay that to the other person. You didn't respond to Phyllis but it is a great point that you claim I ""misunderstood"" you which very much implies you had a specific meaning. If we were speaking in different languages perhaps you would say the interpreter misspoke about what you said? but that is impossible under your view.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","07:36 PM","abortion-debates","87"

If we were speaking in different languages perhaps you would say the interpreter misspoke about what you said? but that is impossible under your view.","Sigma","261416","I think what are irrelevant? The meanings of the passages? That's untrue. I don't believe I claimed this. The interpreter must decide what the words are trying to convey and then convey that meaning. The point is that the interpreter decides what the meaning is supposed to be. In a few ways it is similar to our case, where there are 9 interpreters to a written document who may or may not all interpret a passage in the same way. In a few ways it is similar to the ""don't do drugs"" message, as well. One interpreter may look at the context it was said in and say ""It was meant to apply to drugs used for recreational purposes"" and another may look at the person who said it and say ""It was meant to apply to drugs that were used solely for recreational purposes at the time it was said "" (I believe you fall under that, Steve) and yet another could look at it and say ""The text says no drugs. There are no exceptions given in the text"" and interpret it as a prohibition on all drugs for any reason. All are valid interpretations. The most rational is the first, and the application would change based on the changing society. If what was said was a phrase agreed upon by many people and meant to answer a different question, what rubric do we use to determine this?","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","08:28 PM","abortion-debates","88"

You then went and assumed the message was for recreational drugs, and that the reason not to do them was because they are bad. Afterwards you based a conclusion on that. Lets take this example and convert it to a law. The constitution says ""dont do drugs"" and at the time marijuana was illegal and considered a drug. Fifty years later scientists claim marijuana is actually good for you. Does this make it so marijuana can no longer be forbidden by the constitution if a judge agrees with the scientist using the rubric you find so dear? I would say the only reasonable view of that law would be to say that unless congress changes the law (or amends the constitution) then marijuana will always been considered under that law. Otherwise you have changed what it meant. You assumed things that might misrepresent what the law meant just like I can assume things and misrepresent what you say. When this happens what you said or what the law says didn't change.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","08:45 PM","abortion-debates","90"
