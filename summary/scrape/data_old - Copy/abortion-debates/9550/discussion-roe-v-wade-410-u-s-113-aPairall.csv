"04-30-2007",1,"9550","53","Steeeeve","260989","Not in the sense you mean though. You may apply it to situations now but you certainly don't change the message. For example if the message in this letter from your parent was ""do not do drugs"" and your parent happened to be a strong believer than marijuana was no good then the message is obviously at that moment in time that she/he did not want you to do drugs including marijuana. I think we agree here. Now, say, in the future, marijuana becomes legal and socially acceptable. Does this change the meaning of what your parent said? Certainly not. If you were to start doing marijuana it would clearly be going against what your parent said. This doesn't answer the question. In your opinion can judicial decision be wrong. They either can or cannot be. If you say ""maybe"" or ""sometimes"" then that would obviously have to be a yes. If you disagree then please explain.","Sigma","260992","A more correct analogy would be having the letter contain the message ""Don't do drugs"" and then advancments find clear medical benefit to marijuana use. You would have to decide, based on your situation and knowledge today, whether the message you were given was a prohibition against recreational use of drugs or if the prohibition was literally ""Don't do any drugs even for medical reasons"". Both interpretations are valid even if the intended meaning was to prohibit marijuana. To view it literally would be extremely limited and narrow-minded imo. I could not say it was wrong , however, by anything except my own opinion. It depends on the rubric. A certain decision could be wrong by one measure and not be wrong by another. Is that clear enough?","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","02:13 PM","abortion-debates","143"

The reason I added in my example that the parent said ""Don't do drugs"" and at the same time was very much anti-marijuana was because this shows a text and a history (context) behind the meaning. At that very moment at the time being written it was very clear what was meant is it not? There was no exception and there was no other meaning behind the statement. All you can logically say from that statement at the time written was marijuana was a drug that should not be done as spoken by the parent. In the future things might change but those words don't take new meaning. You have no way of knowing what the parent would think today and to imply their message means something different now is just absurd and is untrue. The way to change the statement is not to try to think for the person that wrote it but to rewrite a statement. Likewise in the law you just have the legislatures change the laws to suit the times. Your method is nothing more then merging the duties of the legislature with the duties of the judges. Would you disagree? Finally you say the approach I approve of could really not be wrong. This confuses me because it leads me to believe that you could never say a decision is wrong which is what I discuss below. This would imply that you find that a decision can never really be wrong. In fact, if Roe v. Wade were overturned you would not call that a wrong decision if they were using a ""rubric"" that found abortion not to be in the constitution...such as orginalism wouldn't find this. From what I understand it seems that you find anyway of viewing the constitution is ok. Is this a fair statement? Furthermore, could it be said that no one really could ever know what the constitution means if it is the case that it means whatever 9 people want it to mean at that given point in time? Seems like an awful lot of power for a branch that was supposed to have the least amount of it.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","04:19 PM","abortion-debates","403"

The powers of the Federal gov't was to be extremely limited. Not individual rights :-\ It could, or it could not. The meaning behind the prohibition likely was a prohibition against recreational use of drugs. Whether pot was intended to be included when that advice was written is really irrelevent. It doesn't matter what the parent would think today. Not one iota, imo. The parent was bound by their viewpoint and prejudices. Neither of those things have any relevance to the decendant. The message itself is important, and the meaning behind it. It is up to us to interpret that meaning and how it is relevant today, not to try to think ""what would they do if they were faced with this"". Yes, I would disagree. I would call it the wrong decision to overturn Roe . You would call it the right decision. It depends on the rubric.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","04:42 PM","abortion-debates","176"

It is a very limited document because the federal power, like you said, is limited. given those to facts I don't see how you could reasonable suggest otherwise. What you are saying is that words have no meaning. If what the parent thought then what does it matter what he/she wrote? You might as well just make up your own writing if that's the standard. All your view does is save paper. How is it not the merging of the two? You take a law, find it to not apply to todays world, and then create one that does. Seems that is a legislative function. Please explain differently. [/quote]I would call it the wrong decision to overturn Roe . You would call it the right decision. It depends on the rubric.[/QUOTE]And this still avoids the question. Do you call it wrong because your ""rubric"" is correct? Or are you suggesting there is no one correct way to view the constitution? If this is the case then you would never have an instance where the court could be wrong.

To view the Amendments as you suggest is very limited and narrow-minded. Individual rights were not meant to be limited and narrow-minded. I'm sorry, this section does not make sense. Please clarify. I'm sorry, this section does not make sense. Please clarify. Looking at the meaning of the passage does not change the passage, let alone create a new one. SCOTUS has not made any legislation, they merely interpret the law (or the Constitution, in this case). This is a legitimate power and in no way merges the Judicial with the Legislature.

Aside from the fact that we are indeed talking about federal power might I ask how you can tell me, as one who doesn't believe I can be wrong, that individual rights are not meant to be limited and narrow-minded. You implied that the words of the parent have no meaning to today. You go on to say that we should still honor those words but change the meaning behind them. This, to me, means that all you are doing is saving a piece of paper with those words on it but you certainly aren't honoring what the parent said. The parent had one meaning and one meaning only so who are you to say it means something different now? Even if this did apply to the law how could one ever understand the law? In theory, you believe that, say, the first amendment could mean that you could limit all speech, limit no speech, limit some speech, limit only words that end in ""y"", etc etc and none of these would be wrong toe them so long as that is what you believed. What a crazy notion where words have no meaning. I agree that looking at the meaning of a passage does not change the passage but you already stated that the meaning of a passage is of no significance. SCOTUS does get to interpret the law but you are not saying this. You are saying SCOTUS gets to decide what the law should say....ie the meaning behind the words. SCOTUS may not be changing the ink on the paper but that ink is merely a way to communicate with the meaning being the important aspect. Simply put, you have words and meaning behind those words which allow us to understand things. Changing the meaning behind those words is just as much changing the law as is changing the actual words. I do not understand how there is no right and wrong in your worldview yet you still continue to talk to me as if there is one.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","10:57 PM","abortion-debates","374"

No, Steve, we haven't been talking about Federal power. The relevant portion re:abortion has much to do with individual rights and very little to do with Federal power. The extention of individual rights will undoubtedly come up with Phyllis, so it will be discussed then. That's blatantly false since what I said was: The message itself is important, and the meaning behind it. It is up to us to interpret that meaning and how it is relevant today SCOTUS does indeed interpret passages in applying them to situations today, using what they perceive the meaning to be in order to make rulings. Right and wrong are subjective in this instance. It's a hard concept, I know Good thing for you I patiently explain these things.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","10:43 AM","abortion-debates","142"
"05-02-2007",2,"9550","72","Sigma","261312","Yes, this is the job of the interpreter. The interpreter decides what the speaker is trying to convey and conveys that meaning (that the interpreter determines) even if not the translated words themselves to the listener. In our case, Judges determine what the meaning was and applies that meaning to new and changing situations. Judges can and do indeed have their own bias, and so the meaning they determine may differ from Judge to Judge. Whether a certain interpretation is correct depends on the criteria you are using.","Steeeeve","261357","Again, who's meaning are the trying to convey? If person 1 says ""I like sailing"" and the interpretor tells person 2 that person 1 said ""I like boats"" is this not an incorrect interpretation. Point here is that the meaning is based on what the first person said no matter how much time passes and this meaning doesn't change. You want to make it so if time passes the interpreter can add meaning. In my fine example perhaps para-sailing was invented between the interpretation from person 1 to person 2 so does give the interpretor the right to decide person 1 like sailing and para-sailing? No.","discussion-roe-v-wade-410-u-s-113-a","03:44 PM","abortion-debates","117"
