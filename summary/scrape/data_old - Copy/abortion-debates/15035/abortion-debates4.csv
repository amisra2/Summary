If there is metabolic activity, for example, we can say a cell is alive... but the metabolic activity isn't life. You have to provide evidence of life because life itself cannot be measured.

"02-20-2011","15035",4,"Stonewall","424420","Nobody is going to argue that a zygote, embryo, fetus, or whatever isn't alive. It is. And abortion does kill , but it isn't a person (philosophical term or not) and doesn't have rights. A woman shouldn't be forced to grow a person inside her against her will. In my opinion, it isn't a person until the fetus is viable. I'm not in support of 'partial birth abortion' (that is unless the mother's life is in danger or other possible reasons). As someone else mentioned, the circle of life never really ends. Life doesn't 'begin' at conception. That was the point of the twin thing. When does the twin's life start? That zygote is identical to the one of a single child. It's all a process... just because egg and sperm unite doesn't mean a person is magically created at that moment. The sperm and egg are both alive well before conception. Both are indeed 'human' in nature. I know, I know... 'but the egg needs fertilized.' But the zygote/embryo/fetus also needs a lot more to become a human. It needs to feed off the mother... That's just as much a part of creating a human as conception is. Every time a contraceptive is used, sperm are being killed (as well as any other time sperm is otherwise 'wasted.')... potential humans are being killed. That's all a zygote/embryo is--a potential human. It still needs a lot more to become a human, just like an egg needs a lot more, or a sperm needs a lot more. It really is a lot like the seed/tree argument. Destroying or digging up a seed is not the same as cutting down a tree. Anyway, I know I'm just rambling, so I'll stop.","amirsdaddy","424443","Well thank you for staying on topic for the first couple of sentences. The original topic was ""When does life begin?"". So thank you for answering that. Personhood and rights are matters of philosophical and legal debate respectively and although I'd love to get into those, that would be getting off topic, now wouldn't it? Notice the words ""in my opinion"". That should clue you into realizing that what you said was opinion, not fact. Not provable and not supported by empirical evidence. In fact it is supported by your own subjective standards of morals. SUBJECTIVE. But once again, that's getting completely off topic of the original question ""When does life begin?"" not ""when does a 'person' become a 'person' and what are the woman's rights?"". The circle of life never really ends? What is this, The Lion King? Thanks for that, Elton John. However, if you follow that concept through to its full conclusion then a living human being is a person. If they procreate, they've then created a person. Since life is a perpetual ""circle"" then personhood has never been lost from the very first person until now, including every child in the womb. That is, if you follow that theory to its logical conclusion. Personhood would only be transferred without loss to a new life. Again, regarding twinning and chimerism... You're ignoring the fact that life had to exist in order for a twin or chimera to form. So whether you want to call it one and then later two (for twins) or two and then later one (for chimerism) is really a moot point. it has no relevance on when life begins, only the philosophical debate over personhood. And again, according to your theory of the ""circle of life"", it wouldn't matter anyway since life is a perpetual circle and personhood is merely transferred and not lost. Either way, the argument holds no water. Perhaps you're missing the key component about sperm and egg begin 'alive' but not human life. The sperm and egg or no more human life than any other individual cell within the human body that contains ONLY the one person's DNA. Reproduction is only possible in humans with two distinctly different sets of chromosomes...23 from the male and 23 from the female. And at that point of fertilization when those chromosomes combine, it becomes a separate and distinct individual human life that is no longer just the living cell of a human but the very unique (and measurably so through DNA analysis) human life. It is now separate from both its mother and father but shares some genotypes and phenotypes of both. Is it beyond you that a separate and distinct individual cannot come into being if the egg is not first fertilized by the sperm of a different human being? Hence, the beginning of life occurs at conception. You had it right when you said a sperm (or an egg for that matter) is a ""potential human being"". That is when there is a potential for that sperm or egg cell to unite and become an ""actual human being"". Once that happens, there's no doubt scientifically that it is now a totally new separate and distinct human life. The child in the womb does need nourishment from the mother. That is a fact. The scientific definition of life does not mean that it has to provide its own nourishment. In fact, there is no living human being that doesn't get its nourishment from somewhere else. A newborn is no less dependent on the mother for all its needs than a child in utero. The only difference is that one is out of the womb while the other is still in it. Both are completely and utterly dependent upon another human being (for some time) to continue to live. Why else would women have the capacity to lactate if not for the specific and solitary purpose of providing the child with nourishment, just like the umbilical cord's purpose. Again, complete independence from another living thing is not a requirement for the scientific definition of life. There is nothing more that a fetus/embryo/zygote/child in utero needs to become a human life, it already is a human life. It needs to continually exhibit all the defining characteristics of life to continue to be a human being (as we all do, no matter what stage in life we're in from the child in utero all the way to the elderly). Thank you.","when-life-begins","11:14 PM","abortion-debates","48"

You can look at consciousness in either the physical (scientific) sense or the metaphysical (philosophical) sense. Now if you're referring to consciousness or life in the physical/scientific sense then yes, you absolutely can measure it. If you're talking in the metaphyscial sense, then you're right, you can't measure it. You can't prove it. I'm not even sure what solid empirical evidence you could even amass for it. What you call evidence to debate philosophical concepts is the same as me ""witnessing"" or providing ""testimony"" to why I believe God exists. I still can't prove it and my evidence probably isn't going to be received by someone who doesn't believe in the existence of God. Again, all subjective. And again, taking the subjectivity out of the argument since neither side can definitively prove, disprove or even provide substantial empirical evidence that supports one position or another, we have to fall back on what CAN definitively be proven. And in the case of when life begins, it can and has been definitively proven by science to begin at conception. It's nothing the same. There was ACTUAL evidence to conclude definitively within the scientific community the definition of life. Does anyone dispute that definition? And how did they arrive at that conclusion? By observing and measuring the world around them. Apparently they were able to measure and observe certain characteristics of things around them to conclude a single, uncontested definition of what is living and what is not... or to even arrive at a conclusion for that matter. Are you saying that YOU of all people are disputing the scientific definition of life? If so, I'd love to hear your reasoning that transcends the great minds of science that came before you. I didn't quit the discussion. As you can see, I'm still here. You said you could ""prove"" to me (provided we agree on the same basic premises and precepts) that personhood doesn't begin at conception. You have yet to provide me with anything that I can even remotely agree on. The original question is an impossible scenario through an impossible hypothetical. nobody could LOGICALLY arrive at a definitive answer to that. Does the end of life actually have to do with the beginning of life? After all, they are separate and distinct stages of the cycle of life (not to be confused with Elton John and Stonewall's ""circle of life""). But for the sake of argument, life ends when all characteristics of life cease to be met. The only exception to that is the characteristic of being composed of cells and the requirement to be organized in a specific way since those will only deterioriate with decomposition and not necessarily death itself.","when-life-begins","12:20 AM","abortion-debates","49"

""evidence that human life begins at conception""). Look at life and consciousness in the physical and scientific sense I tell you with certainty that there are no direct means of measuring either. We don't know when humans possess consciousness and we don't know if animals possess consciousness. We can speculate and point to this or that evidence, test to measure response and the like. But there is no way of measuring it directly. The same with life. Certainly we don't dispute that we are alive, but at the same time there is no way to measure life besides indirect means (are we metabolising nutrients?). Now you're saying the same things as I am :P Yes, there is evidence and no, I don't dispute the definitions. I just understand the limits of definitions and evidence. They are used because there is no direct way to determine what is alive and what is not. I'm not disputing the definition, I am pointing out that they created a definition and then checked to see what conformed to it and declared that it is alive. They can't measure it, they defined it. lol... If I were abreast a beam of light, what would it look like? I believe one of the greatest thinkers of the world asked himself that question. Hypotheticals, even impossible ones, are useful for conceptual discussion.

Thank you.","Stonewall","424456","Your original question was begging for a philosophical argument. There is no debate on whether a zygote, a sperm, or any of those things are alive or not. They are. But that is completely irrelevant to your position. I think anybody who reads the OP understands that you are trying to say a person is there at conception. You see, you can't claim the term 'person' is purely philosophical and then demand empirical evidence proving something to be a person. It may not be supported by anything other than opinion, but I think it is reasonable to expect a human being to be able to survive outside the womb. There you go again, throwing around the word 'person.' You could also say that since every human who reproduces is an adult that they create an adult. (I realize young girls can get pregnant, but typing 'post pubescent' or 'sexually mature' didn't have the same ring.) You're begging the question... LIFE is the perpetual circle. Not personhood. Human life =/= human being. Also, I should have said 'cycle' not circle, but you got the point. If I was really wanting to reference Elton, I would have picked a better song. I'm not ignoring anything. Just because the zygote must be alive doesn't make it a person. Sperm certainly are human life, just not human beings. My hair, along with every other cell in my body, also has 46 chromosomes, just like the zygote. Having DNA does not a person make. I get the point that it is different than a sperm or egg, and that it is a unique organism, but again, that doesn't make it a person. And if it isn't a person yet, it isn't relevant. Also can't happen until the sperm or egg are created. Or until the parents have sex. The life of the components are already alive before conception. But yeah, when the zygote is created, it is definitely the beginning of that zygote's life. A totally new, separate, and distinct human zygote, yes. A human being, no. I never said anybody was truly independent, and I never said personal independence was a requirement for personhood. I was simply stating that it has to stay inside the mother and feed in order to develop from a cell to a human being. Although I didn't mention it there, though, I would argue that to be considered a person, the organism would have to be able to survive outside the mother's body, though. Yeah, all it needs is time, the right environment, and the right nutrients. Same as a plant seed. The part I bolded confuses me a bit as to what you mean. Are you conceding that a zygote isn't yet a human being, or are you using the terms 'human life' and 'human beings' interchangeably. If that's the case, what human being characteristics (personhood traits) does the zygote exhibit? There's no brain, limbs, organs...","when-life-begins","04:42 AM","abortion-debates","51"
