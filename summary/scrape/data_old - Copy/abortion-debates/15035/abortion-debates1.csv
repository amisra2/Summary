A sperm is a cell that contains human DNA and is specifically for reproducing. And an egg is the same. It's not until that sperm and egg meet (fertilization) in which 23 chromosomes from the mother and 23 chromosomes from the father create a unique individual with characteristics and traits all its own that previously had not existed. It is at this point when all the requirements to be considered life are met. The question wasn't when do RIGHTS begin, the question was when does LIFE begin.","when-life-begins","04:44 PM","abortion-debates","5"

There is a difference between a living cell and life. None of those living cells in your body alone could be construed as a human being.

"02-16-2011","15035",1,"amirsdaddy","424179","You try again.","Sigma","424190","It's a fair response. What is human life is different than asking what makes a human being. We could probably keep a brainless body alive for some time, but it wouldn't be what people would generally think of as a human individual, a human being, a person.","when-life-begins","07:20 PM","abortion-debates","9"

There are unicellular organisms and there are multicellular organisms. In a unicellular organism (a bacterial cell, e.g.) the living cell and the life of the bacteria are indistinguishable from one another. There is only one cell and is therefore both a 'living' cell and the life of a bacteria. Multicellular organisms are more complex, comprised of multiple cells (anywhere from a few to several trillion). Thus, the cell is considered living but is separate from the life of the organism. Because a multicellular organism is not dependant on one cell for it's life, rather the combination of all its cells, then the living cell and the life of the organism are distinguished from one another. A human sperm cell does not make a human life (even though it is a living cell) because a) it doesn't meet the scientific requirements of what is considered life and b) the sperm cell in and of itself, cannot reproduce into a living human being nor can it grow into a living human being. It's only when the sperm and the egg meet that allows this new cell to grow and develop into a human being that is capable of reproduction, hence at fertilization it has now met the requirements of the scientific/medical definition of ""life"". Because it is human (that being the only thing it possibly could be due to its unique DNA) makes it a human life. Well you're certainly entitled to your opinion... even at the blatant disregard for scientific fact. It was a reiteration of my statement/position which apparently went right by you. I presented the facts throughout the entire post. It's up to you whether you want to believe and accept it. Yes, we are in agreement at that. Just as I mentioned before, skin cells, brain cells... every cell in your body is living and contains your DNA. And only your DNA. It is only when the DNA from a male and a female combine that makes it a new separate and distinct life, person or human being... whichever you prefer. They're all the same to me. That combination of the DNA happens at fertilization (aka conception).","when-life-begins","10:54 PM","abortion-debates","15"
