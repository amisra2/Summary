That it is both an evolutionary miracle as well as a having the power of God to resurrect itself? I did understand you. My arguement was at what point does one become either in possession of rights? Remember I said it often becomes a punishment for immoral behavior. And when she is not responsible? The mother didn't choose to become pregnant. if she had she wouldn't want an abortion. Hence the importance of when does it become a person, what constitutes life? One can not enslave the other either. It is a fact a heart resting outside the body is not considered to be functional. You implied at 4 weeks its a little person. A tree sapling looks like a miniature tree. Everything it needs to survive it has. At 4 weeks an an embryo has lumps that will later be organs, but at 4 weeks they are blobs of cells. It looks nothing like a human, but more importantly it cannot survive outside of the womb. It is easier even if subconsciously to defend a human being than an embryo. I don't think abortion should be a form of birth control. I don't support late term abortions unless there is a some health concern either to mother or child. I think there is a brief period the least amount of harm, not none, is done that will permit a woman to decide what the rest of her life will be like. There are very few things that carry life long consequences. Marriage and career can but not like becoming a parent especially for a young unwed woman. Statistically she is more likely to live at or below poverty, if she was in school she likely will not complete it for a number of years if at all. She will often been looked upon with pity or as a reason someone else can be thankful they are not her. Most employers will not appreciate her needs with regards to the care of the child. She is likely to suffer from lower self esteem and depression. Many opportunities will no longer be available to her. Her male child has a good chance to have legal problems and not finish high school. Her female child is less likely to have legal problems, but more than makes up for that with a higher chance of becoming pregnant in her teens. She will likely rely on day care or a public school system to provide guidance and teaching of basic social skills as she will need to provide for both their needs. The guidance will most likely some from peers who will have more influence than the overworked, under qualified teacher at the barely adequate school they are likely to attend. This of course this is not every case and the pitfalls are not all or none. A women may face none of them or just one or two or all. But odds are that to some degree that is what her life will look like. I don't think our society is improved or or made better by this. I don't think I have the right to impose this life or anything that resembles it on another person. When you say you are for protecting a human being from being harmed by another you are assuming that human wants you to do so and the harm being prevented outweighs the harm that prevention will cause. In principal I agree with you. It just reality adds shades of grey to your black or white scenario and it is that gray that pushes me the other direction at this point. This is a choice of the lesser of two evils with not much to be happy about either way.","Steeeeve","472471","No but interestingly enough there are theories on it(googled it just now): Are Butterflies Two Different Animals in One? The Death And Resurrection Theory : Krulwich Wonders... : NPR I think my point is that the process for butterflies radically different from anything that happens to humans. It is very misleading to say this is similar to the birth of any mammal. It was also misleading of me to say ""change species""....that was merely puffery . I see, from existence is my answer. I'm not sure how it is a punishment. It is merely accepting a consequence on an action. Once you take responsibility for something you can't reverse that at the peril of another. This isn't a great example but if you are responsible for pet sitting a cat it would be wrong for you to just walk away in the middle of the cat owners vacation leaving the cat to die. In terms of a pregnancy, the unborn child had no choice in being in their current situation as the parents put them in that situation. If you assume for a minute that the unborn child is a person would you argue the mother could abort because she doesn't want to take responsibility for the remainder of the pregnancy? Maybe not, but she is responsible for the baby being in the current situation. Like I keep saying, there is no difference between person and human being so to be it is not an important question. As for enslaving, it is not for the same reasons described above. It actually is functional. There is a circulatory system working as this has to be the first thing working. The other organs are formed but not needed so they don't function. Your lungs aren't needed until after birth but it doesn't seem like you feel a baby in the third trimester is not a person. Fetal development: The first trimester - MayoClinic.com It is. What you look like doesn't make you a person or not. I know some pretty ugly looking people but I'm not about to say they aren't people. At works weeks it doesn't have lumps..it has the organs, at 4 weeks the heart is the only one really used (set aside skin for now). You could identify specific organ tissue if you really wanted to. Just curious, does what the baby look like matter to you? So if he/she looks like a human would that be the point where you say it is a person? Also, from what I understand 40% of abortions happen after 9 weeks. 26% 9-12 weeks. So we are on the same page that a human embryo is also a human being in the same sense a human child is also a human being? In terms of abortion this is all irrelevant to me. People like Simone will chime in and say I'm cold but the sad story of a women struggling doesn't negate, in my mind, that she want's to kill someone. In my mind it would be this same story and therefore she wants to toss her 1 week old baby into the trash. Naturally the sympathy for the woman goes away in that scenario. I actually know a number of people that had an abortion...I suspect we all do...there is not one instance where the persons circumstances were as you describe. Every story is ""oh sh*t, I'm pregnant! Well I'm still in college and want to finish up so I'm getting an abortion"". After you work in a hospital for awhile you also see the other side of this coin...the couple that comes in, the women is bleeding everywhere, she has lost her kid after trying for years to get pregnant. Those really are the two scenarios you see most often...at the hospital anyway. Now, if we want to talk about poverty and what we should do to help, I'm all for it. Yes. We assume life as a society and I'm comfortable with that. I don't want to have to tell the fireman that I want to be saved from the fire. It certainly isn't as easy as I make it sound on these forums, I'll grant you that. However, if you come to the realization that a person and human being are the same the answer in 99% of the cases is clear. Those 1% are a little harder to deal with just like the 1% of anything in life (99% of the time you wouldn't kill someone but what if someone breaks in....etc...those kinds of situations).","when-life-begins","12:30 PM","abortion-debates","136"

Kareema Cross, a medical assistant who worked at Gosnells Womens Medical Society clinic for four-and-a-half years, testified in a Philadelphia court today, telling of the horrors of babies who survived abortions only to have their necks snipped with scissors.

There is a theory (as in this one) which was retracted as scientifically unsupportable from another journal, but I agree it is an interesting approach to what is a strange process. The comparison was not supposed to highlight the specific stages of development, but that there are stages where the initial entity becomes something different while still under the broader definition of what it is. Which is technically where we disagree. The question of when is existence recognized as having a right superior to the mother's? When if ever can that right be not recognized? If there is a 50/50 chance the mother, child or both may die if carried to term you have a problem that your position is unable to address. If the mother is in accident where she can be kept alive through life support, but cannot be given anything for pain as it would kill the child is another problem your position is unable to deal with. My point is not to portray these as representative of the typical scenario, they are not, but to point out things are not black and white. Situations like these and ones where the dilemma raises similar issues. If your position can be shown to not be applicable in every case then you must establish under what circumstances it is applicable and when it is not? The child is a threat to the mother if she carries to term or the child carries a genetic disease that puts life expectancy at 5 years tops. Is she irresponsible in terminating the pregnancy? Is she even allowed to? Are these the consequences the child is now responsible for? It may have had no choice in being there, but you accept on its behalf the responsibility for keeping it there. Yes it would be wrong and yes it is not a very good example. You are comparing a conscience decision of accepting a responsibility that has if any only short term and insignificant consequences that you would have been aware of prior. The acceptance is made without emotional or physical influences nor is there reliance on any third party involvement. (birth control) And when the mother did so against her will? When the mother is unable to understand these consequences and/or is coerced? (Rape, incest, drug use, mental incapacity, minors) I don't have to assume if it makes it easier that is what I am saying. There is a period where that group of cells that otherwise would grow into a child most likely a copy of any one of millions currently running around were it allowed to fully develop is a group of cells that can be prevented from further development prior to its ability to understand, comprehend or feel anything. You can phrase it as she just doesn't want the responsibility discounting what may be real valid concerns to the one who would have to deal with them, but should she accept it. Keep in mind the age group with the most unwanted pregnancies is under 18. If you want to have the stats, it is a long read though and uses info from the 90's, but is the largest and most complete research on the subject go here Guttmacher Institute: Home Page Except when she is not or are you suggesting becoming pregnant is always the responsibility of the women? The heart is outside the body. Where in everyday life does one keep their heart outside of their body? You seem to suggest that the organs are ready to go just waiting to be born so they can be used in the manner they were made for. It takes time for them to grow. How can they be functional when the brain and spinal column are still forming as well as the nerves that would control them or the pathways that connect them? At 9 months all of these have developed. That is why birth occurs. That is why at 4 weeks it is not viable outside the womb even with life support systems, it has not yet developed enough to survive. If something costs 1.00 and you have .99 cents you don't have the 1.00. You have a handful of pennies, you will have a dollar when you get another penny, but at that moment you do not have a dollar. You continue to attribute the future to the present. Everybody knows what it will be, but this is about what it is. It doesn't. You started us down the path of physical appearance and this is where it ended up. I get 88% within the first 12 weeks. I have to make a distinction because allow for abortion to occur within a certain time frame or under certain circumstances. There must be some way to distinguish one from the other. Current law uses viability, which is about the same time embryo becomes fetus. Otherwise yes. Who has less compassion the one who with the thumb up who says let it live or the one with the thumb down who says let it die? It is never easy and there are always worst case scenarios. For that reason I don't think a generalized response which over rules any choice the individual may desire is the best method. That will be the next annual fee that someone will not pay and so will not be saved. Your position makes no allowance for that 1% (or higher), but once you open that door where does it get closed again?","when-life-begins","04:12 PM","abortion-debates","140"

Let me know if you really wanted a response to something. That's fine but I'd argue this is a moot point. No one cares about adult vs child in terms of ""being a person"" so why fetus vs adult? You ask about extremes that make up less than 1% of what we are talking about. While I'm ok with this you have to understand that the same kind of extremes can be used in just about everything. A general rule you might have is that you shouldn't kill a born person (I say born so you know what I'm talking about). But what about a situation where you are rock climbing and your friend is attached to you. They slip and based upon previous knowledge you know that if you cut the rope and they fall they will have a 25% chance of survival while you will be fine. If you don't cut you both fall with a 25% chance of survival each. So what do you do? That's not always an easy answer but I do know that 99.99% of the circumstances will lead to the answer ""do not kill my friend"". The same thing applies to abortion. I may not have an answer for every scenario but I do know the answer for 99.99% of the scenarios. I don't need to argue the remaining extreme scenarios to prove my ""do not kill a born person"" moral. Punish the person responsible. The baby is still not responsible for being in that situation and shouldn't be punished to death for it. I'm confused in what you are saying. I'm more or less asking what your criteria is. In other words, if it isn't simply being a human being, what is it and how is that not arbitrary? Physically, yes. It is currently impossible for any other woman or any man to assume that responsibility. In terms of any financial impact or other impact outside of the actual development it is the responsibility of the persons who created the baby. In fact, you could argue the financial responsibility rests more with the father as the woman, at some point, may not be able to perform the duties that provide her with a way to live. I think dead beat dads should face stiffer penalties than what is currently on the books. This is misleading. It is not necessarily outside the embryo, merely no rib cage as formed around it so it looks like a protrudes from the body. It's actually a medical condition if you are born like this and people have been born like this. Either way, this is at 4 weeks and by week 6 this no longer is the case. I don't see while survival has anything to do with it. A 1 day old baby can't survive without help from someone else. The organs are formed and they are growing from that point on. I am not implying they are being used, they aren't...no reason for them to be. There is, however, a functioning and used brain and heart as those are needed. The last one is always the lungs which aren't used at all until birth. To be frank, I think viability is about the dumbest concept I've heard (I realize it has been around awhile). A baby can't survive at 1 day on their own so why does location change the definition of viability? I've never really gotten a reasonable answer from anyone on that. I'm not sure what you are asking and how it relates to what I said. Please clarify But this gets back to my point of identifying the parties involved. IF we are talking about one person, I'd agree. It is my view that two persons exists each with rights and therefore one may not make a decision to kill the other...in general. It only hinges on the fact that we can't just assume it is only the woman that exists. My position is that two people exist with equal rights. It allows for 100% of situations.

At 18 we make a distinction between child and adult even though that person may or may not be capable of being one. Why 18? There is no physical change that can be said to make a person an adult and an emancipated child can be an adult at 16. No the figures are significantly higher than 1% In 2006, 49% of pregnancies were unintendeda slight increase from 48% in 2001. Among women aged 19 years and younger, more than 4 out of 5 pregnancies were unintended. The proportion of pregnancies that were unintended was highest among teens younger than age 15 years, at 98%. At 15 that would be the parents. At 15 that would be raging hormones, naivety, lack of education or a whole list of other factors that should at least shed some responsibility from the person who is still a child.

It tampered with the woman's hormones and her emotional state, it was where it was supposed to be, it improved her physically, but she used birth control.

I thought you were talking about rape, incest, and risk of mother/child life? Were you not? Fault and responsibility are two different things. Rape (mental incapacity goes with rape) is the only instance where fault goes with the criminal. Responsibility is the duty of someone to handle a situation. In all cases it is the responsibility of the mother when she is pregnant (and as otherwise noted in my previous post). What do you consider as ""finished"" to a person? How is this meaningful? It seems extremely arbitrary. If you remove a 10 week old unborn baby from the womb it will die. If you remove a 10 week old born baby away from their caregiver it will die. The only difference is location. I just don't see why location of development matters in one case but not the next. Oh, well thank you Not a human being. Simple as that for me. The second you are a unique human being you have rights. I believe distinguishing between person and human being is extremely dangerous and if history is any indication, it never ends well.","when-life-begins","11:40 AM","abortion-debates","144"

They have a right to life or more accurately others have a duty to not kill or abuse them, but either way the fact remains that children do not have the same rights as adults. Regardless of reason we have created a distinction between one type of human being and another. We justify violating the inalienable rights of minors citing their best interest. That this usually works out for the best and fits within what culturally we find morally acceptable causes nobody to complain, but that doesn't change what it is. I thought you were talking about rape, incest, and risk of mother/child life? Were you not? Mental incapacity is not necessarily rape. One may be a willing participant, but have no grasp of what they are participating in. In this context the end result for you is the same. What significance is there to say your not at fault, followed by but you still have the responsibility. Where is her inalienable right to her own life. This is the punishment concept I spoke of. Through no fault of her own she is made to become against her will an incubator and then provider for another person. What she wanted for her life, gone. Taken away by a stranger who is determined to impose their idea of morals onto the rest of the human race. As I said a caregiver can be found for 10 week old newborn overcoming its inability to feed and shelter itself. Nothing can be done for a 10 week old removed from the womb who has not developed enough. Yes its arbitrary. A point in development was needed and of all the possible factors viability seemed the most reasonable and relevant. They could have just said the 8th Friday from conception, but that doesn't allow for any variation. But why? Sperm and eggs become a commodity instead of the ingredients to make a person. When eggs and sperm are donated, combined and placed in a womb we don't give consideration to that newly engineered human being, we think it just swell someone who couldn't have children now can (unless they are gay, then it suddenly matters) Sperm and eggs pretty much only have one use, making people. Each egg and sperm will make a unique person. When the embryo's are placed in the woman they put some extra to improve the odds knowing that some will not survive. Why is this seen as a perfectly acceptable part of what is considered a wonderful advancement of technology?","when-life-begins","12:07 PM","abortion-debates","145"

You can't consent to something without knowing what you are consenting to. Really neither here or nor there though. Still present. Well over 90% of the time it is her fault but 100% of the time it is her responsibility (again, as described in another post) what you want in your life is not a right to life. A right to life is merely the right to exist. Your second sentence is silly, come on, you know that. That's not really relevant. This implies ""what you want"" is a right over someones life. I don't by that. You'd also have to conclude that if a caregiver didn't exist the killing of the newborn would be justified. I don't see that happening. Why isn't a sperm and egg a human being? This is more of a biological lesson that I really don't think is necessary. Besides, we seem to both be in agreement that a sperm and egg are not a human being so this is really not a necessary discussion.","when-life-begins","01:16 PM","abortion-debates","146"

Although the DOI says unalienable, in practice we have inalienable rights. In my view Natural Rights are an attempt to take legal and moral rights and place them in an objective position. That there is no accepted list of what rights are and are not included and the lack of any type of enforcement mechanism make them perfect for philosophy and political science majors to write about. If we assume for the debate that they exist and are unalienable the fetus using her body as life support would have a right to exist, but would not have the right to make the mother provide a means to do so. You can blame her or say she is now responsible or that consent was implied by her actions, but she has the right to her body and to make her carry to term would violate her rights. In this scenario there are no duties or moral responsibilities that can infringe on her rights. It could even be argued that the fetus can not have a right to exist because that right can only come from an act that violates the rights of the mother. You probably didn't even get this far before you started responding. I will try and make this brief If we assume the rights are inalienable then we are at where we are at. Rights are granted, they can nullified, forfeited or modified. There exists a system of coercion to compel people to respect others rights all of which is influenced and subject to the prevailing degree of morality and desire of the public. Now she still has a right to her person. The embryo is now though not necessarily in possession of the right to life simply because it exists. That is granted and where you and I are at an impasse. I notice you left out half of the paragraph that the above was in response to and was relevent I thought given the direction this went. Reproductive medicine currently will create several unique human beings place them in a womb knowing that that only one is the the most likely number to survive if any do. Research is done to advance our medical knowledge in some cases using these unique humans as lab rats. Why is this acceptable and morally tolerable? But really in a philosophical sense why does she have the responsibility if she was put into this position or even if she did so willingly. You say she has an obligation she says she does not. Your emotions based on life experience and cultural values is what you believe gives you the right to compel her to conform to your concept of right and wrong. If you came home and there was a baby on your doorstep with a note saying name is Bob doesn't like carrots raise him well. You would not think it is now your obligation to take care of it. She should not be the scape goat just because she is convenient. It can't exist without imposing undesirable obligations on her. Typically when one party infringes on the rights of another the damaged party is granted some form of relief. Legally benefiting from violating the rights of another regardless of fault or intention is not rewarded. Maybe the presentation was extreme but the concept is valid. You have a set of values that are important to you. You have decided that at least on this issue that what you believe and to the degree you believe it is the minimum that every person should be subject to. Their belief may be different, but that is just something they will need to learn to deal with. For the most part circumstances and reasons are unfortunate and may be important to them, but that should have been a consideration before she had sex because she doesn't have a choice anymore. But the pursuit of happiness is in the DOI. Now the question becomes does she have a duty to provide life support and care that is harmful to her (philosophically speaking not necessarily physical)? Using rights derived from what exists in nature there is plenty of evidence that she has no obligation at all. The existence of a caregiver is meaningless. They aren't trying to establish the need for a babysitter. A reasonable point in development was needed for legal clarification, You may disagree that there was a need but that doesn't change that it was. Since being alive is an integral part of having and needing rights the point at which a person can actually be alive seemed a good idea. That is also why it is relevant. Just like kids the dead don't have the same set of rights as living adults. Think philosophically along the lines of both being frozen until they either expire or are used for any one of a number of different possibilities.","when-life-begins","04:32 PM","abortion-debates","147"
