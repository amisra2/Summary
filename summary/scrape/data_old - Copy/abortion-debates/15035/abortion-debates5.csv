However, this single cell is alive by any biological definition of life and defines the beginning of each new human being. This single cell is unique from both the father's and mother's cells, so it cannot be defined as just part of the woman's body.","when-life-begins","11:22 AM","abortion-debates","67"

An education, a job, a mother, a shoulder to cry on....., so at what point do we determine how independent a person should be to be considered a human?

"10-21-2011","15035",5,"None","None","None","Theophilus","441204","I don't have the text on hand right now, but the characteristics that are described (and if you wish for verification, the author is Saladin) are: 1. Movement 2. Complex Organization 3. Metabolism 4. Responsiveness 5. Growth 6. Reproduction (sexual or mitotic) 7. Evolution (this not referring to macro-evolution necessarily) As soon as a sperm cel fertilizes an egg, the gamete meets all of these characteristics. Actually, so does the haploid sperm and egg. So I guess life begins before most people think it does. At least according to my textbook.","when-life-begins","06:07 AM","abortion-debates","73"
