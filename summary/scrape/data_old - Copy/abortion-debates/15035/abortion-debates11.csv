"04-29-2013","15035",11,"pappillion001","472748","If we assume for the debate that they exist and are unalienable the fetus using her body as life support would have a right to exist, but would not have the right to make the mother provide a means to do so. You probably didn't even get this far before you started responding. Reproductive medicine currently will create several unique human beings place them in a womb knowing that that only one is the the most likely number to survive if any do. Research is done to advance our medical knowledge in some cases using these unique humans as lab rats. Why is this acceptable and morally tolerable? But really in a philosophical sense why does she have the responsibility if she was put into this position or even if she did so willingly. You say she has an obligation she says she does not. Your emotions based on life experience and cultural values is what you believe gives you the right to compel her to conform to your concept of right and wrong. If you came home and there was a baby on your doorstep with a note saying name is Bob doesn't like carrots raise him well. You would not think it is now your obligation to take care of it. It can't exist without imposing undesirable obligations on her. But the pursuit of happiness is in the DOI. Now the question becomes does she have a duty to provide life support and care that is harmful to her (philosophically speaking not necessarily physical)? Using rights derived from what exists in nature there is plenty of evidence that she has no obligation at all. The existence of a caregiver is meaningless. They aren't trying to establish the need for a babysitter. A reasonable point in development was needed for legal clarification, You may disagree that there was a need but that doesn't change that it was. Since being alive is an integral part of having and needing rights the point at which a person can actually be alive seemed a good idea. That is also why it is relevant.","Steeeeve","472825","And I would come back to the same point I've made before. If you aren't required to provide for another in the womb you aren't required to provide for another outside the womb. You called that one right! Ha. I honestly don't know much about this so I'm not sure I'm the best person to comment. And this isn't something new...societies generally work that way. We dictate morals in a society and those who don't approve can either leave or suffer the consequences for breaking them. Yes I do. If I slam the door and let the baby die I failed in my moral duties. Naturally I would call the police in this kind of situation. Different from a born child how? And ""you can put it up for adoption"" is not an acceptable answer. This gets back to fault and responsibility. I think you and I can both agree that the unborn baby has absolutely no fault in being in the current situation he or she is in. The fault is almost always with the mother and father and in the case of rape with the father. Fault doesn't necessarily mean they meant for it to happen. If you accidentally slam into the back of another car you are at fault but that doesn't mean you meant it to happen. I'd argue you can remove rights for someone at fault. So 90+% of the time we are talking about a fault of the mother and father and therefore I think a right of self is easily overrode by a right to life of the unborn who is at no fault and can only survive in the womb of the mother. The remaining scenarios, mainly rape, are no fault of the mother or unborn. At this point you have to decide which right prevails. I argue life trumps in this case. It is very meaningful. I here ""viability"" all the time but the term is useless. Ability to live outside the womb with a caregiver versus inside the womb with a caregiver is a worthless distinction in the abortion debate. I say this because the argument has always been the woman has no obligation to provide care. So when the baby is outside the womb you can't pretend that argument never existed. It literally reads like this: ""A woman doesn't have the obligation to provide care while the unborn is inside the womb because the unborn cannot survive outside the womb but a woman does have an obligation to provide care for a born child who survive outside the womb but only with the care of another"". This implies that survival for a brief period of time (aka ability to breath) outside the womb is relevant to obligation to provide care but I can't for the life of me figure out how it remotely relates.","when-life-begins","10:13 AM","abortion-debates","152"

"05-02-2013","15035",11,"pappillion001","472916","I don't either, it just as I was thinking about a response popped into my head that if we say life begins at fertilization the reproductive science is got some real issues. I guess the killing of what are thought of as people is ok as long as it is done trying to make more people. Are you leaving or suffering? Granted your position leaves no room for compromise, which only makes it that much more difficult, but the current system I think is about as fair as possible. By saying raise him I meant til he is an adult, not until the police came to pick him up Her acceptence Going back to inalienable vs unalienable if the the right can not be lost once attained there must be a means to establish a means to overcome when two rights may conflict. In this case The woman had a right before the child existed. A right can not void another so the child can not have its right until by doing so it does not violate the mother's right. Not quit. She must accept responsibility when outside the womb. Her obligation is created by her acceptance and she is given two chances to decline. Once at the beginning of pregnancy and once at birth","Steeeeve","472918","Thank God you posted; I was getting worried Easyrider and Accipiter's bullsh*t would take over this thread. I'm not even saying human life begins at fertilization; honestly I'm an accountant, not a biologist, so I don't really know what happens from fertilization to implantation. Frankly I don't have to know to hold my position. I'm merely saying that a human being has a right to life same as any other human being and there is no difference between person and human being. Well, I'm not breaking any of the rules so I'm not suffering for doing so nor am I leaving. Well, the police is an option we currently have. Should no one be able to take care of the baby..say I'm on an island and the next boat comes in 18 years...then yes, I'd have a moral obligation/duty to take care of the kid. I'm glad you brought this up though. People (not necessarily you) tend to change their stance on something when more options exist. So it's kind of like saying ""I support this until it's too hard"". I don't think rights of someone should depend on the difficultly of a situation. This is why the emotional arguments related to a pregnancy are meaningless in terms of my stance on abortion. I'm not sure this answer makes sense to me. You stated ""It can't exist without imposing undesirable obligations on her."" to which I responded that this is the same with a born child so what is the difference. Are you saying there is an implied acceptance of responsibility at the time of birth? I wasn't going to bring this up but you keep referring to inalienable vs unalienable. Those are actually the same word . So I'm going to try and answer but let me know if I misunderstood your statement. Rights are tricky and a society has to always decide how and when rights can be removed. This, of course, happens after deciding what rights exist...both natural and society created. Inalienable rights is a fine term but it means ""cannot be taken away from another"". I'd argue that common ""inalienable"" rights cannot be taken away by another unless there without proper due process (as in a crime took place, you are at fault, and we have a proper way of dealing with such a crime). I'd say someone can give up a right through actions of their own. While not an inalienable right, you can give up your right to a jury trial even if this causes great harm to you in the future. So for the sake of argument lets assume an inalienable right exists for the child (right to life) and the mother (right to oneself). In all instances other than rape the mother and father engaged in an act that can result, and this isn't exactly unknown, in another human being being forced into a position of only being able to survive with the help of the mother. In this case the mother (and father as described earlier) gave up her right to self by engaging in an act where the possible consequences are known. The unborn child did not do any action that took a right away nor do any action that gave up a right. You therefore cannot take a right away via due process nor did the unborn child give up their right to life. As such, the right to life cannot be taken away even if the mother wishes to regain her right to self. In the case of rape the same thing applies on the father took away a right. Therefore the only one that can be punished by removing a right is the father. why not inside the womb? I'd argue that you don't have a choice to decline should another option not exist. If adoption is not available you still have an obligation in my opinion.","when-life-begins","12:49 PM","abortion-debates","157"

Then you are saying the fertilized egg is a person. I don't see how you can make your position work any other way. I know I was kust giving you a hard time for your statement. Usually a take or leave it statement is offered by the person with the benefit so when you said it considering laws are currently not as you would like I couldn't resist. I am not sure get this, I think from the perspective of placing a burden on someone it matters. I think that is part of the basis for labor laws as an example. Yes. Once a person accepts the responsibility they have the obligation to provide reasonable care and protection. It is ok I was a little confused myself at first, which is why when I first mentioned it I tried to explain it a little. For the most part the two words carry almost the same meaning and today have become interchangeable with a leaning towards inalienable. This is for a reason (at least I speculate it is) The Declaration of Independence uses the word unalienable to describe the self evident rights given by our creator. Which in context would make sense. These rights are incapable of alienation meaning they can not be taken or given away. Inalienable rights are not subject to alienation meaning someone can't compel you to give them up, but you may be able to voluntarily do so or forfeit them. As I described from a legal position dealing with criminals this may run into problems if they have a right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that cannot be infringed upon by the government who has a duty to protect the tights of its citizens. Going to jail would impair those rights. For the DOI it was important to establish that the people had something to compete with the Divine Right of Kings, but it creates a problem trying to enforce justice. if we look at Bouviers Law Dictionary (A.D. 1856) well see: INALIENABLE. A word denoting the condition of those things the property in which cannot be lawfully transferred from one person to another. Public highways and rivers are inalienable. There are also many rights which are inalienable, as the rights of liberty or of speech. UNALIENABLE. Incapable of being transferred. Things which are not in commerce, as, public roads, are in their nature unalienable. Some things are unalienable in consequence of particular provisions of the law forbidding their sale or transfer; as, pensions granted by the government. The natural rights of life and liberty are unalienable. Unalienable vs. Inalienable | Adask's law I did sort of explain this in my earlier posts, but I understand how with most sites one would use as a reference the distinction is not made or not emphasized so would lead you to think there is no difference. But moving on, the factor important here I believe is when does the right to life exist. Do you have a problem with the idea of taking someone off life support? It isn't considered murder, but if you can sustain your own life, meaning your body functions even if you are unable to feed yourself or move that person may not end their life even if they want to. This is really no different. If we say a fertilized egg is a human with rights how do we justify artificial reproductive science. Most women are like Octomom, but only one or two actually make it to develop and be born. In that case we are making extra people to better her odds. Legally though the child has no rights. The 14th amendment establishes rights are for citizens born or naturalized within the US. Can you imagine the immigration nightmare if if the fertilized egg is recognized as a citizen and therefore protected under the 14th?","when-life-begins","01:48 AM","abortion-debates","158"

""[A] number of specialists working in the field of human reproduction have suggested that we stop using the wordXembryoXto describe the developing entity that exists for the first two weeks after fertilization. In its place, they proposed the termXpre-embryo.... ""I'll let you in on a secret. The term pre-embryo has been embraced wholeheartedly by IVF practitioners for reasons that are political, not scientific. The new term is used to provide the illusion that there is something profoundly different between what we nonmedical biologists still call a six-day-old embryo and what we and everyone else call a sixteen-day-old embryo. ""The term pre-embryo is useful in the political arena -- where decisions are made about whether to allow early embryo (now called pre-embryo) experimentation -- as well as in the confines of a doctor's office, where it can be used to allay moral concerns that might be expressed by IVF patients. 'Don't worry,' a doctor might say, 'it's only pre-embryos that we're manipulating or freezing. They won't turn into real human embryos until after we've put them back into your body.'""

You are wrong, life begins before conception all the way back to when the first self replicating molecule made a copy of it self, I do not believe that a fetus is a person however. Before a baby is born (and for sometime after that) it does not have the complex thought processes that are required to make it a person, in fact that hamburger you ate for lunch had a more developed consciousness then a baby has. Do you remember your own birth?","when-life-begins","06:08 AM","abortion-debates","162"
