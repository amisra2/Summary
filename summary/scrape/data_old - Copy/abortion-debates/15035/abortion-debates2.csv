"02-16-2011","15035",2,"Stonewall","424197","So an acorn becomes a tree the moment I stick it in the ground?","amirsdaddy","424209","No. By definition a tree is ""a woody perennial plant having a single usually elongate main stem generally with few or no branches on its lower part."" -Merriam-Webster The botanical definition varies slightly and is a bit more complicated but in practice is basically the same as the dictionary definition. An acorn certainly doesn't fit into that definition, covered in dirt or not.","when-life-begins","11:01 PM","abortion-debates","16"
"02-16-2011","15035",2,"Sigma","424190","It's a fair response. What is human life is different than asking what makes a human being.","amirsdaddy","424210","Is it? Scientifically it's not. What you're talking about is a philosophical and religious debate. And although I won't discredit philosophy, it's not a science, nor can it be proven. I can give you proof that a fertilized egg is a human life by the standards of science (we can argue semantics all day but you can't refute that it is by definition ""life""). But you can't provide a single shred of proof that a fetus, unborn child or whatever you prefer to call it, isn't a person, a human being or a human life... not from a philosophical standpoint or any other.","when-life-begins","11:04 PM","abortion-debates","17"
"02-16-2011","15035",2,"smiley","424201","It is still 'life' even when only a bud on its parent tree!!! But is it an 'oaken life'?","amirsdaddy","424211","This is what we call the apples to oranges logical fallacy. You're comparing a human to an acorn. Not the same thing. But to answer, it is by nature oak. It is by definition an acorn and not a tree.","when-life-begins","11:08 PM","abortion-debates","18"

Q.E.D Of course, that ignores the crux of the question: namely, is the fetus a person in the philosophical sense.","when-life-begins","11:24 PM","abortion-debates","19"

Can you deny that a fetus is a human life? I suppose YOU could, but that would be disregarding science as it's already been shown conclusively that it is, in fact, a human life. Technically the crux of THIS question on this post was ""When does life begin?"" There was nothing about the philosophical discussion of person or personhood. So, can you prove that a fetus is NOT a ""person"" in the philosophical sense?","when-life-begins","11:39 PM","abortion-debates","22"
"02-16-2011","15035",2,"Sigma","424214","Is there no such thing as a tree that does not meet that dictionary definition?","amirsdaddy","424218","You tell me... Even if there was a tree that didn't fully meet that definition, an acorn still comes nowhere close to that definition.","when-life-begins","11:43 PM","abortion-debates","23"

"02-16-2011","15035",2,"Sigma","424215","Change the dictionary, change the thing?","amirsdaddy","424220","I didn't know it was that easy to just change the dictionary. There's a reason why we've written things down and defined them... So we don't call a boat a car, a dog a cat or an acorn a tree. It tends to cut down on the already confusing language.","when-life-begins","11:45 PM","abortion-debates","25"

Even if there was a tree that didn't fully meet that definition, an acorn still comes nowhere close to that definition.","Sigma","424221","Well, let's examine the definition: a woody perennial plant having a single usually elongate main stem generally with few or no branches on its lower part. If we eliminate the portions with the qualifiers ""usually"" and ""generally"", then we are left with: a woody perennial . How early would an oak tree be considered made of wood?","when-life-begins","11:45 PM","abortion-debates","26"

A dictionary doesn't determine how we use language, it records how we use language. If we all woke up tomorrow and agreed to say ""cat"" to refer to dogs, dictionaries would change to reflect this. I don't really know how quickly it would happen, but it surely would.","when-life-begins","11:46 PM","abortion-debates","27"

If we remove the brain of an adult and put it in a jar while keeping both the brain and body alive and separate, would you agree that it is rational to say the 'person' is in the jar? Meaning that if you killed the brain it is rational to say the individual would die, while if you killed the body the individual would continue to live. This hypothetical is to determine, loosely, what the definition of a person would be.","when-life-begins","11:54 PM","abortion-debates","29"

I don't know how many times I can say the same thing a different way for you to understand. I tell you what, go enroll in a biology class at your local college. Ok, so let me get this straight... your argument to ""prove"" to me philosophically that a fetus is not a person hinges on a basis of a hypothetical? One that isn't even possible? Sorry but to PROVE to me that a fetus isn't a person, you should probably start with facts, evidence or at least a common shared belief (not based off a hypothetical situation that can't actually happen).","when-life-begins","12:18 AM","abortion-debates","30"
