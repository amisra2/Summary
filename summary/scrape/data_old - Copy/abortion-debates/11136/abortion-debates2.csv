Exactly so, because that is now a born person. 61 minutes prior, it was neither a person nor did it have rights.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","06:09 PM","abortion-debates","16"

I will not be engaging you further in this thread. But, as I said, I sure would like to see a discussion between yourself and Another opinion.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","06:42 PM","abortion-debates","17"
"04-12-2008","11136",2,"Archangel","308420","I know that the soul exists, which is why I made my claim . Just as sin isn't a man made concept What's a ZEF?","Colonel Ingus","308427","LOL If you knew it was a fact ( which is impossible ) then you wouldn't have called it a 'claim' Ooh... that's gotta hurt If that's true then you should be able to prove it. Knock your socks off. You'll excuse everyone else if we don't hold our breath. OH MY GOD! You're in an abortion debate and you don't even know what a ZEF is? What a joke! You have just lost all credibility. Please wait for the ride to come to a complete stop before attempting to exit.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","06:46 PM","abortion-debates","18"

But, as I said, I sure would like to see a discussion between yourself and Another opinion. Nice try at the old ""divide and conquer"" trick. All it proves is that the pro-choice folks here, unlike you profetallifers, do not march in lockstep. That's the reason why, when it comes to the topic of abortion, it must needs be left to each individual's values and morals, not the law. Don't let the swinging door bump you on your butt as you make your exit.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","06:52 PM","abortion-debates","19"

"04-12-2008","11136",2,"Phyllis","308418","Rights do not necessarily imply responsibilities.","Colonel Ingus","308432","What do responsibilities have to do with it?

Many people claim that the Easter Bunny and Santa Clause are real, but most adults know it isn't true. They used to claim that the moon was made out of cheese, but most adults know that isn't true. They used to claim that the world was flat, but most adults know that isn't true either. You can claim anything that you want, but claims and facts are not the same thing","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","07:18 PM","abortion-debates","22"
"04-12-2008","11136",2,"electrolyte","308437","You said that there can't be overlap.","Colonel Ingus","308440","No, I was saying that overlap doesn't mean squat. A claim is just that, a claim. It is neither true or false. The fact that some claims may be true is a moot point. That is pure argumentum ad ignorantiam","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","07:47 PM","abortion-debates","24"

Is there some grammatical rule that states that using the word claim in conjunction with a fact is improper or fallacious? Be clear son, you're not making any sense. So no, it doesn't gotta hurt at all, for me anyway. Duh... me so dumb. And evidently google is too because nothing came up in reference to the unborn or abortion when I googled it either. I must assume that I hit the nail right on the head when I said this: What's a ZEF? Is that another secular humanist term that's intended to marginalize the unborn babies that pro-abortionists endorse killing to the tune of 1.4 million a year? Which explains why you edited everything after my question in order to attempt to ridicule me with just the question. Kind of lame and a very weak style of debating, not to mention dishonest. Now if ZEF means anything different than how I defined it, then own up and define it unless you just made it up.","how-important-soul-pro-life-views","07:47 PM","abortion-debates","25"

Now you say that claims can be true, but you're avoiding my point, which is that something that is a known truth can be stated as a ""claim.""

We're still waiting for that hard core proof That doesn't say much for google now does it Try a medical dictionary or a dictionary with acronyms.
