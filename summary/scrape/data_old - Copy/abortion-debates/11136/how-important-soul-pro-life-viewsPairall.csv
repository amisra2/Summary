They also believe somehow that until a child breathes its first breathe, it can't be called or considered a PERSON.","Colonel Ingus","308408","I agree with you, that's just plain silly. First of all we don't know if a soul even exist, and secondly, even if we had proof that it did, we have no way of knowing when it becomes reality for that person.

So no, it doesn't gotta hurt at all, for me anyway. Duh... me so dumb. And evidently google is too because nothing came up in reference to the unborn or abortion when I googled it either. I must assume that I hit the nail right on the head when I said this: What's a ZEF? Is that another secular humanist term that's intended to marginalize the unborn babies that pro-abortionists endorse killing to the tune of 1.4 million a year? Which explains why you edited everything after my question in order to attempt to ridicule me with just the question. Kind of lame and a very weak style of debating, not to mention dishonest.

I could look ZEF up in every medical dictionary on Earth and it will never give the definition for a slang of 3 different words put together as an abbreviation. So what you did was lie and make up a medical term that doesn't exist in any dictionary; then you proceeded to call me stupid for not knowing.

I challenge you to produce a link to the word ZEF in any medical dictionary. That's where you told me to find it, so prove it's there and it's me who's too ignorant to find it. For once stop turning your ignorance around on others and just support your lies. PROVE TO ME THAT ZEF IS A BASIC MEDICAL TERM. I CHALLENGE YOU TO SUPPORT THAT ClAIM. SO GIVE ME A LINK WHERE IT IS USED AS A GENERAL TERM IN THE INDUSTRY. AND TELL ME THIS GENIUS, WHY WOULD THEY USE THE TERM ZYGOTE EMBRIO AND FETUS AS ONE WORD IN THE SAME SENTENCE? FETUSES GET ABORTED, BUT THAT PROCESS TAKES PLACE LONG AFTER THE ZYGOTE AND EMBRIO STAGE; SO USE SUCH AN ABBREVIATED WORD IN A SENTENCE THAT MAKES SENSE IF YOU CAN. I WANT TO SEE IT.

I can overlook someone like archie for putting words in my mouth because... well because he's 'archie', but I respect you as an educated person so hopefully you won't try that same tactic. Perhaps.

I'm sure it's to be found in other places too but I've wasted far too much time already on this pettiness showing that it does exist.
