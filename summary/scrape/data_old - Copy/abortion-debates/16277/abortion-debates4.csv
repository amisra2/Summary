Abortion isnt a one day affair. In Europe at least it requires medical evaluation, psychiatric intervention and it is always the last resort. Many clinics advocate the alternatives strongly before even discussing it. The church has suppressed women for its entire existence. From work, education, equal rights... The last bastion of the christian faith on women is Abortion and the issue of female bishops. Thankfully in Europe at least i would say we have moved on... In a situation where we have no proof for god, or the spirit, or any aspect of a divine creator in the judeo-christian sense i'll go with equality and respect the women which have to make one of the hardest decisions of the lives.","gift-god","10:40 PM","abortion-debates","57"
