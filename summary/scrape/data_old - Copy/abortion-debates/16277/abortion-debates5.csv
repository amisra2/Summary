I am a little concerned at the prospect of all the other illusory women who walk about though. Perhaps the price they pay for being an ex. What your argument boils down to is ""real women know their place"". The church and the bible have said this to be an abomination, an entirely male dominated organisation and literature. Hence women should follow the rules. I don't think it even needs saying but this is a viewpoint of the totalitarian edict of the feudal ages. I I find it rather ironic that under your name you should have the words ""One nation under god"", as you clearly have less than equal standing for slightly more than half of your nations citizens. Perhaps we could amend this to ""One penis under god"". And then all rejoice of the great fallace in the sky. I As for the idea of abortion killing 20/30 million. It has already been said that a number of those children would have had debilitating diseases and illness. I If the woman feels that she could not love a child from this who are we to judge. I It is a shame that your passion for embryo rights ends at birth and not at the actions of the church against young boys and also the millions that have died, and will continue to die through religious action in Africa against Aid's. I I find it amazing that you can extend equality of freedom and right to live to a ball of protocells no larger than a dice, and yet in the same breath condemn half the population of your nation who have the choice to use those rights. IPregnancy is not a gift from god, it is an effect. It has a known cause. I And furthermore i would much more inclined to listen to the moral guidance of religious individuals about the gravity of this effect if they spent more time helping to teach young children, teenagers and the vast majority of Africa about the use of contraception in the prevention of this effect and its related diseases.","Easyrider","473579","A Savior, not a lothario. Need I remind you that female leaders delivered the people in the Book of Judges and elsewhere? That husbands and wives are commanded to submit themselves to each other? See above. But you'd prefer them lying on their backs having their innocent babies butchered! Where's the champions of the innocent unborn in your godless cesspool of a nation? So kill them instead and make sure they aren't healed. Marvelous. You've got to be kidding. Understanding that killing the innocent unborn is an abomination is a no-brainer, except for the spiritually-challenged, that is. More nonsense. Still waiting for a cogent argument. That one is nonsense also. You can find the cause in Psalm 139:13 and Jeremiah 1:5. Here's what one Christian President did. George W. Bushs Legacy on Africa Wins Praise, Even From Foes - ABC News Of course, the amount of aid given to Africa by Christian organizations is incredibly impressive. But your aborted babies won't be able to help them, because of people like you who aid and abet their demise. Choose life. Your mother did.","gift-god","02:31 PM","abortion-debates","61"
"05-23-2013","16277",5,"Hdreams","473591","Let me just get this right, as i don't want to put words in your mouth. You would prefer to live without equal rights for all, as long as abortion was illegal? i think you were just born in the wrong century EZ! Without upsetting your tentative grasp on medical science, until 20-22 weeks the embryo/fetus is not a living separate organism. I really don't know what your point is here? That President Bush helped increase the number of people receiving retro-viral treatment is fantastic. This has nothing to do with combating the cause of HIV/Aid's for which the church has condemned millions to die of over the coming years. If a mugger stabs you and then drives you to the hospital i don't think all would be forgotten. Also this article says nothing of the inaction to promote contraception, the liberation of women through education and basic sexual education which has been shown to work time and time again in the prevention of sexually transmitted disease.","Easyrider","473592","There is no freedom in murder (abortion). You are slaves to sin in pushing that abomination. You kill the baby. Where's his freedom? Sure it is. It has its own individualistic DNA and its cells are multiplying. 100% of the time (unless it is terminated) it results in a human being. Bush is a Christian and increased aid to Africa to combat AIDS. And tell me how the church has condemned millions to die over the coming years? The liberation of women has, as a side product and with the help of their sexual partners, created a culture of fornicators and baby murderers. If they don't repent they'll wind up in hell. How liberating will that be?","gift-god","05:55 PM","abortion-debates","63"
"05-23-2013","16277",5,"Hdreams","473594","So the answer is yes then, you would prefer to live in a society where women do not have equal rights but abortion is illegal. are you sure? yep, your sure","Easyrider","473608","First tell me where the equal rights are for the innocent unborn?","gift-god","11:56 PM","abortion-debates","65"

"05-25-2013","16277",5,"Hdreams","473627","I don't get a vote, its not my choice. And it isn't yours either. In many cases such as Trisomy 13, anencephaly and Potter's Syndrome, the baby would die either during or immediately after birth, having no chance of survival. The child would suffer tremendously and so would the mother, yet even now you say abortion would be sinful in such a case. It is a shame that your passion for embryo rights ends at birth... and not at the actions of the church against young boys... and also the millions that have died, and will continue to die through religious action in Africa against Aid's. And also does the placenta belong to the church? Is the placenta capable of original sin, and if so can it be absolved?","Easyrider","473673","The polls are still open. In your world there's no hope. In mine there is a God and if it's his will such a baby lives a full life God will make it happen. I'm not in favor of any embryos being terminated. Who says I condone pedophilia? Get real. What religious action? The placenta isn't a baby. Although I think that's possibly where some liberals get their brains.","gift-god","08:05 AM","abortion-debates","71"
"05-26-2013","16277",5,"Hdreams","473684","No, they are most definitely closed. Equal rights is here to stay, whether you like it or not. If the U.S even took the unconscionable step of banning all abortion, this would merely drive women and couples to go to Canada or even Mexico for them. Wrong again, i have the same level of hope as you do. In fact probably more. Since i put my faith in humanity... turning itself around through science and discovery rather than the action of prayer and belief. Belief doesn't cure children in the 3rd world of a clef palette, prayer doesn't cure malaria or provide anti-retrovirals for HIV/Aids. Modern science and medicine do, and as for hope. ""... you realize that you don't need a mythical deity to have hope."" ... my statement referred to your lack of passion for their rights after birth. The action of advocating that contraception doesn't work and condemning millions to die from HIV/Aids in Africa.","Easyrider","473695","The day is coming when your whole liberal wasteland will be brought to a screeching end. Christ will return and all the unrepentant baby killers will be cast into Hell. Humanity is mortal. The universe itself is dying (entropy). Your fate, sooner or later, is doomed. Don't be naive. You haven't been to the healing services I've been to and seen people healed and cured of all kinds of issues. And as for science, it wouldn't be here it is today without great men and women of God who founded or contributed to many of the scientific disciplines. Creation scientists and other biographies of interest I'd love to see your compelling evidence to back up your myth claim that Jesus Christ is a myth. Nonsense. More nonsense. If that bothers you so much, why aren't you over there helping out?","gift-god","11:07 AM","abortion-debates","73"
"06-15-2013","16277",5,"Hdreams","474267","Its off topic, but this is something iv never quite understood. How some religious believers seem to revel in the idea of apocalypse and mass death. Seems to me to be contradictory to the idea of compassion and forgiveness on which the church was founded. Humans are mortal, Humanity will probably become extinct or evolve. In the long run your right that the universe will will expand towards heat death through entropy but that doesn't mean its dying. New stars are born all the time and will continue to do so for the next 10 trillion years. If you revel so much in your own personal doom no wonder you dream of a magical sky kingdom after death. Perhaps make more of today and you wont long for what you dont have tomorrow. But like a teenager shrugging off the beliefs and fictions of childhood, so must humanity. I said mythical deity, Not jesus christ. Jesus may have existed in one form or another. It matters little to me, the bible was put together by man, probably Ezra many years later. You have no proof that Jesus THE christ (I.e God on Earth) existed other than circular argument and eye witness reports of iron age peasants who would view a lighter as magic. The irony is EZ that you are an Aethiest almost as much as me, in that im sure you dont believe the miracles of mohammed, flying to heaven on a winged horse etc. Which is more probable than resurrection. I just went one religion further.","Easyrider","474273","You've never read of the final judgments in Revelation and elsewhere? Even Jesus talked about them. The universe will end. If you think otherwise you haven't studied total entropy. Where's your evidence the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus are fiction? Nonsense. Scholars note some 40 different authors of books of the Bible. The historical Gospels and epistles provide independent confirmation of Christ and the early New Testament church. People can claim it's bs but for the last 2,000 years have not been able to falsify it. Jesus is Lord!","gift-god","06:23 PM","abortion-debates","75"
