Maybe God is a psychopath then. There are indications that psychopathy may be genetic, so when a psychopath rapes he is passing along his psychopathic genes. Are these genes a gift of God? Should a woman be forced to bear a psychopathic child who will go out and rape and murder? Is that the will of God? Men who commit incest are psychopaths. Priests who take advantage of children and molest them are psychopaths. Pope Benedict XVI who claims to speak for God has protected psychopathic priests who rape.

Late term abortions need to have a really good reason to occur, not because the mother couldn't make up her mind or is having a bad day. I do believe that given the reality of what having a child means to both the young or unwed or both or even old and married or any combination that it isn't the place of some unknown idealists who feel their views are proper for everyone else in every set of circumstances. If you don't believe in abortion then don't have one. Be happy that we are far more compassionate that God when determining what a grounds for abortion and the methods used in its implementation. The fact of the matter is of those 50 million roughly half would be unable to pay taxes due to physical or economic reasons, examples causing this range from physical disabilities and incarceration to poverty and lack of education. 3 of the 4 mentioned are prevalent among young unwed mothers, followed closely by unwed or single mothers. Many conservatives yell that a women cannot have an abortion, while at the same time yelling that social programs that are in place to help mothers deal with the problems having a child creates are unfair and the recipients undeserving. It seems only fair that if you are going to make her have the baby that you should help pay for it. Otherwise make it your business when it involves you. You can also think in terms of self survival, how many of those 50 million do you think would have become Christian and how many atheist or something non-christian? Just a reminder the Bible has rules about when an abortion can occur and God has no problem with it being done up until the day the child is born.","gift-god","11:15 AM","abortion-debates","7"

Perhaps we could amend this to ""One penis under god"". And then all rejoice of the great fallace in the sky. I As for the idea of abortion killing 20/30 million. It has already been said that a number of those children would have had debilitating diseases and illness. I If the woman feels that she could not love a child from this who are we to judge. I It is a shame that your passion for embryo rights ends at birth and not at the actions of the church against young boys and also the millions that have died, and will continue to die through religious action in Africa against Aid's.
