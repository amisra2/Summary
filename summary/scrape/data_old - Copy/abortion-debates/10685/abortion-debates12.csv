This rather sounds as though you would give men a veto power over the ability of a woman to control the future of her pregnancy. Is that what you really meant to say?","Archangel","298404","Duh!!!!!!!!! If a woman goes to a sperm bank and acquires donated sperm that men give up all rights to, then that is her business only. But when the pregnancy was caused by the consensual act of both adults resulting in a pregnancy, then by what standard do you just erase the mans value and rights as one of the parents responsible for this child's existence? If I tell a woman she can drive my car, have I then given up all rights of ownership once she is in possession of it? Can the then dispose of my car because she is in possession of it? I think not. That would be called theft. So on what grounds do you justify her right to take the unborn child they created together and then discarding it without the fathers approval? And before you say because it's her body, she took that risk knowingly and willfully placed her body in that position, so why is she not held responsible for any of her actions, but everyone around her IS? And why does she get everything she wanted out of the relationship, but when it comes to giving equal rights to the man, then he has no say in the matter. And yet, on the obverse, if the man doesn't want to baby to be born but the woman does, again she has total control and can force the man to support that unwanted baby for 18 years. How is any of this scenario equitable for the man under any of these circumstances?","abortion-self-defense","11:09 AM","abortion-debates","166"

Its, frankly, not your health, ability to work, body, and potentially even life that is on the line. I would hope that women in a healthy relationship review options with their partner so they can make a decision together - and I suspect most in that situation do. You see, I keep waiting to see this huge wave of fathers whose evil sex partners are out having abortions against their wishes (snicker). More often than not, that woman is on her own, and that very fact is likely impacting her decision. In any case - when are you gonna quite acting like you actually care? Like you actually want to work on resolutions? All you do is pass judgement. I actually do not support this. I don't believe anyone should be forced into parenting. Babies should be able to be adopted and either parent should be able to sign away their parental rights (to the other parent). (Decision to be made by the time said child is born.) In any case - I actually support measures to reduce unwanted pregnancy and abortion. (Education, access to birth control and health care, assisting pregnant woman (with more than their pregnancies), changing the way we women regard men, and getting rid of unhealthy, puritanical hang-ups about sex).

"01-23-2008","10685",12,"Another opinion","298402","We both agree that the zygote or early fetus will very likely grow into a full person if not prevented from growing. The main difference in our outlook is how we look at what the zygote or early fetus is AT THAT MOMENT, not counting potential for what it will become in the future. I suspect that your belief in a soul residing in the zygote or early fetus makes you automatically attach certain aspects to it without even realising that it is because of the belief in that soul that you attach those aspects. The main aspect is the idea that there is ""somebody home"" in that zygote or early embryo - that it is not just a body, but an early version of a person in there. I think that that is the reason that you use words such as ""innocent"" and ""justice"". Again, you must remember that, for those of us who do not share your belief in a soul residing in the early fetus, it is really just a body at that stage so that the ONLY thing it has going for it is what it will become in the future, not what it is at that point in time. That is a very big difference in outlook. Presumably, you might think that there is some sense of suffering, fear or loss that the fetus itself might feel if it is aborted and I would think that any such thoughts would have to stem from religious belief in a soul. If the early fetus would have no soul, then you might also agree that, at that early point in time, the biology is not yet ready for it to have any mental existence - no suffering, no fear, no pain, no emotions or thoughts of any kind whatsoever, conscious or subconscious. Without that mental existence, concepts such as ""innocence"" or ""justice"" just cannot apply. In many of our views, the first trimester fetus may have the same potential for becoming a born walking talking person as the third trimester fetus, but the critical difference for me at least is that the thid trimester fetus is already similar enough to us to be called us - a person in the most critical sense. The key ingredient is the beginnings of the mind. Since you view some sense of mind as entering with the soul, you might not think that much happens at the beginning of that third trimester. However, not believing in a soul entering at conception, most of us DO INDEED believe that a very critical thing happens around the beginning of the third trimester - a mental existence begins in the fetus. That is a very important difference in our outlook.","Archangel","298409","Hi Ao, ok, let's look at this from a purely natural perspective, shall we? Let's take the secular view of life and forget the soul for a moment. Now look in the mirror at who you are, at your intelligence, your sensitivity and the love you feel. All of the attributes that make you special, unique and very valuable as a human being. Now consider that every healthy zygote/fetus in its early stages of development has every bit the same potential as you do, and your evidence of that is the absolute knowledge within your own mind that you, at one time in your own development, you were exactly where they are now. We don't have to even consider this from a religious perspective or from the vantage point of a soul existing in order to perfectly relate to each and every one of these aborted infants being cut off from life at a stage of development that is precisely where we once were ourselves. And that is whether we believe in the soul or not. I disagree that my belief that fetuses feel pain is based on religious beliefs, but rather, I submit to you that it is based on common sense as a natural progression in my insistence that the unborn are miniatures of you and me. Here is some evidence that science has confirmed what I believe to be true. http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu88fa5...m/nat2191.html What is interesting Ao, is that your beliefs are unique to this time in history because you are enlightened enough through technology to know with absolute certainty what the differences between a first and third trimester fetus looks like, even though you are a layman with no medical background, (an assumption on my part). What is relevant about that though is that you are determining, or allowing others to determine for you the value of an unborn child based totally on its perceived development without knowing for certain, because you have admitted you don't know for certain, what the spiritual ramifications are for our assumptions upon which we are basing our justifications for abortions on. My belief is that we should err on the side of caution if we truly can't answer all of these very valid questions that you have admitted exist, and raised in this debate.","abortion-self-defense","11:45 AM","abortion-debates","169"

It is not much different than trying to relate to an unfertilized egg. Your contention is that fetuses are just miniature versions of ourselves. I might agree with you in the essentials for late term fetuses - since they have the brain development that allows for that essential criteria of mental existence - but would disagree with you when it comes to early fetuses. The brain in just not developed enough to allow for that mental existence. A religious world view may support it but science just does not support it. There is some uncertainty in that line of when the higher order mental processes could start in the brain - where some studies suggest that it can happen a few weeks prior to the beginning of the third trimester. That is why I mostly try to refer to that point as ""around"" the beginning of the third trimester. I would agree with a point that Steeeeve once brought up that trimesters are too large a unit of measurement to use and that weeks would be better. Once discussions and investigations finalize some consensus among neurologists in their understanding of brain development and when such higher order processes can start, then one could set a dividing line in weeks, after which there is too much of a chance of mental existence to allow unrestricted abortion. Either way, there is no scientific support fot the idea that any such mental existence, pain, etc. can happen in the first trimester - where the great majority of abortions occur. Are you claiming that a first trimester embryo/fetus can suffer, feel pain, emotions, etc. - for reasons other than a belief in a spiritual soul? These are relatively late term fetuses. Even so, neurological studies that I have read summaries of say that early fetuses can experience reflex actions that may look to us like pain but are really just the body's automatic reaction to a stimulus (as disected frogs still might show that stimulus response) but do not reflect that the brain itself is registering that pain. I suspect that the earliest of those fetuses in the study you posted (ex. the 20 week-old fetuses as opposed to the 30 week fetuses) are showing just such reflex response. Unfortunately, you article did not mention whether or not this question was addressed and answered. Yes, I cannot say with absolute certainty that there is no soul in a zygote, but I can be equally uncertain that there is no soul in an unfertilized egg, etc. If one takes a belief in a soul into account, which shows no evidence of its existence, then the point at which one can claim that it enters the body can be completely arbitrary. Even the traditional views of Christiantiy, as to when that soul entered the body, varied widely through history - where for much of history, it was viewed to enter the body at ""quickening"" (relatively late in the pregnancy). The idea that the soul enters the body at conception is a relatively recent belief within the Christian tradition. So, even the Church was not clear about this point. Given that uncertainty and the lack of evidence either way of whether or not a soul even exists, I follow the evidence presented by science - evidence that is repeatable and which can be explored in more and more detail.","abortion-self-defense","01:40 PM","abortion-debates","170"

If we were discussing the intellectual potential of early and late term fetuses for the sake of an experiment or some other harmless exercise, then this would be a moot point. But we are discussing life and death here. We are discussing snuffing out the life of the early stage fetus based on its current brain output, or sense of self when we have agreed that if allowed to proceed to the next trimester then it will have the sense of mind. My struggle with all of this is our (Mans) arrogant belief that we can determine that any among us don't meet the criteria for protection from being killed when we were all at precisely the same exact stage of human development in our own existence and personal experience at one time in our own lives. And I mean every single one of us, excluding none. So consider that no one alive today avoided that early stage of no sense of mind, yet here we are discussing the complexities of that state of lacking any sense of self awareness. Doesn't that tell you something very important about the value of the 4000+ early stage human beings who are being aborted today in America, as we speak? Something about their inherent value? Do you not see that in a perfect World it makes no sense that our Society is able to rationalize the stage when the unborn are thinking, self aware beings leading us to agree to killing them, while at the same time forgiving the person doing the killing when we know they can think and should be held responsible for their actions as adults. Abortion insists women need to have control over their bodies while forgiving their irresponsible use of their bodies at the same exact time.

Just because something will become a being we can sympathize with doesn't mean that it is that being AT THIS MOMENT. I just don't understand what it is about the fertilized egg/zygote that you sympathize with. You have no sympathy with the unfertilized egg even though we all also started from unfertilized eggs, yet you have sympathy for the fertilized egg. So, something happened during that process of fertilization that suddenly adds sympathy in your eyes. That is what I don't understand. I can understand that, if you believe in the soul, then you would believe that the fertilized egg has some mental sense of ""us"" in it, but you claim that you would hold this sympathy whether or not a soul would enter the zygote at conception. I guess I just don't see how one can sympathize with something that has no mental existence unless one is artificially attaching a mental existence where there is none. Yes, it will, in the future, gain a mental existence with which one can sympathize but, up to that point, it is just a mindless body - not a being I can sympathize with. I make a clear distinction between what it currently IS and what it WILL BE, perhaps you don't. Also, I will again mention the point that, for me, it would not have mattered if I had been aborted in the first trimester or whether I had never been conceived - the consequences would have been identical. Since I view mental existence as the core of our existence as people, ""I"" would never have existed either way. I owe my existence not only to the fact that my mother's pregnancy was carried to term, but also to the fact that I was conceived, that my parents even met, etc. I am certainly happy that nothing happened to stop that process but it really wouldn't have mattered at which stage of pregnancy or conception that process was stopped. I would not have experienced any difference since ther was no ""I"" to suffer any consequences before around the beginning of the third trimester. What difference would it have made to you if you had never been conceived vs. if you had been aborted in the first trimester?","abortion-self-defense","03:47 PM","abortion-debates","172"

Your half of the DNA does not hold weight next to her entire body for the next nine months. Damn straight they aren't. It is not their partner's body and women, even pregnant ones, are not children or property. For you to be able to trump the rights of a woman to make major medical is nothing more than a violation. It gives me the same warm, fuzzy feeling I got when I was raped. Have I ever told you the stories of my grandma and my mom? My mom grew up in a one room shack with 11 siblings and an abusive father. My grandma could not get birth control without her husband's permission, which he would not grant. So my grandma kept having babies. Babies that he would do little to support. Now this was during the glorious culture of the 40s and 50s that you are glamorizing so on top of not being allowed to make birth control decisions for herself - it was damned hard for a woman to divorce or get the kind of work that would support a family. Telling your husband ""no"" wasn't an option. Spousal rape is still legal in many states. My mother has three children. Her last was my brother born in 1974. She decided at that time she no longer wanted children. She could not legally get her tubes tied without her husband's permission - which my father only granted after the doctor lied to him about the risks of my mother becoming pregnant again. My father would walk out ten years later. I am sorry that you think its unjust that men don't get to make decisions like this for the women in their life. But that is just too damned bad. My grandma and mother both taught me that this body is mine . Period. Its as simple as this - - I don't want to make major life and medical decisions for anyone but myself and my son until he is old enough to make them himself. Bull. One can babble away about all matter of things they don't care about. (Wanna hear what I think about Heath Ledger's death?) I don't believe you care because you don't offer solutions. You simply insult women in a hard place - you wish to disempower them, you trivialize their lives and their bodies. Nothing in your preaching will help. I am not responsible for the actions of ""woman's groups"". I am not a member of one and do not feel compelled to speak for them or offer apologies for them. NO THANK YOU . (See story about my grandma above.) In the 50s I would be stuck with an abusive husband, and unable to support my son when I wasn't worried about discrimination against him for not being white. Today's problems are not going to be solved by retreating into confabulated ideas of what the past was like. To quote Billy Joel ""the good old days weren't always good and tomorrow isn't as bad as it seems."" More than you realize I'd bet. It was just a dirty little secret then. (can anyone say unhealthy, puritanical attitude towards sex/pregnancy?). Why? This is the unhealthy hang-up I am talking about. They are BOOBS. There is nothing wrong with them and its completely natural to like them. There was all kind of sexy going on in the 50s - the styles were just different. Marilyn Monroe is still the most revered pin-up girl of all time. How about Bettie Page? Pedal pushers? Tight sweaters? WHOAH! Now I KNOW you are a misogynist. This really doesn't warrant any more repsect than when Siggy gets on the board and talks about the inferiority of blacks or how the Holocaust didn't happen. Straight up pathetic. Do your daughters know that you find women to be predatory and unable to make a decent living for themselves? As long as people have sex there will be unwanted pregnancy. It happens to single people, coupled people, and married people. And its not new. In previous posts to you I told what things I believe will work and backed those things up with stats and evidence. You have not done this - you have just spun a wildly innacurate fairy tale about the 50s. This will not make a difference. I wear low-cut tops and glitter out to the bar all the time. I never take trash home (or go home with it). The girl next to me could wear a ankle-length skirt and turtle neck and be nailing everything that moves. Change ""sexual openess"" to ""sexuality"" and this is an excellent statment. (I don't believe responsible adults need to be ashsamed of or hide the fact that they are sexual beings.) This all ties to how I feel we raise women and how I feel that needs to be changed. They are told all their lives - by popular culture and often by religion that having a man is the end-all, be-all of the universe. A good relationship with a good man is a wonderful thing. But there are women who will stick to a loser like glue over dealing with the stigma of being single. I choose to be single and I get jeers about it all the time. ""Can't catch a man??"" (like its that hard). We need to stop making a relationship with a man the measure of success for a woman. It is my belief that this idea is responsible for more unwanted pregancies than anything else. They can't stand the thought of being alone so they will do anything to hold on to that man - including sex, getting pregnanct, etc. I wish girls today understood that their sisters, eons ago, had little to no rights over their own lives and were given away in marriage by their fathers. A lot of these women became nuns. In part because they found freedom and power in celibacy that they would not have had married.","abortion-self-defense","04:57 PM","abortion-debates","174"

I could scrape my finger in my neighbor's sink, leaving them some of my DNA. But I don't have a right take their sink with me on the way out the door. Very moving family stories, Jitobear. Makes it clear why choice is so important to so many American women who've been there when *choice* hasn't been. No thanks to America becoming another country ruled by the Roman Catholic Church. Where women are thrown into prisons leaving their real children motherless, shackled to hospital beds as they bleed from illegal procedures, or the poor dump their newborns on some hillside, in a ditch, or a garbage pail.","abortion-self-defense","07:54 PM","abortion-debates","176"

Only in this generation have men become so utterly castrated so as to willfully abandon their rights as an equal contributor to the life they not only created together, but that wouldn't even exist if not for the mans contribution. So how do you say that this guy just left his DNA lying around like it just fell out of his pocket Axolotl?

Do you really mean to say that a man should control the future of a woman's pregnancy? On what grounds? Do you really mean to say that women who are impregnated through an anonymous sperm donor or through a rape should have access to abortions?

"01-23-2008","10685",12,"Archangel","298409","Now consider that every healthy zygote/fetus in its early stages of development has every bit the same potential as you do and your evidence of that is the absolute knowledge within your own mind that you, at one time in your own development, you were exactly where they are now. We don't have to even consider this from a religious perspective or from the vantage point of a soul existing in order to perfectly relate to each and every one of these aborted infants being cut off from life at a stage of development that is precisely where we once were ourselves. Here is some evidence that science has confirmed what I believe to be true.","electrolyte","298474","Wrong. Ao has no ""potential"" to become a human being because Ao is already a human being. But this can also be said about unfertilized ova in ovaries. But, as I've shown above, such ""relation"" doesn't show what you think it does. If we use your reasoning, unfertilized ova -- which you think do not qualify as ""potential"" humans -- are enveloped into this realm that you desire be protected. Yes, here is some evidence that says that fetuses are likely capable of feeling pain by the third trimester, or possibly the late second trimester. How about you rail against third-trimester abortions instead of all abortions if this is your actual reason? Now, because you rail against all abortions instead, this is clearly not the true reason you rail against abortion. But, it's not really about pain at all. Death row inmates feel pain, too, and yet we still kill them...","abortion-self-defense","11:49 PM","abortion-debates","179"
