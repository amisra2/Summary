"12-22-2007","10685",6,"thecap0","294264","Archie, When abortion was first legalized it was supposed to only be allowed for the health of the mother. But look at what it has become, another form of defacto birth control. LIES!! If someone will take the time to read ROE to you, you will find nothing of the sort in the decision. In fact, Justice Blackmun made it clear that in the first trimester, neither the state nor anyone else had an interest in the choice a pregnant woman made. Further, so what if it is another method of birth control to you? Don't you get that it is none of your business what any woman does regarding the future of her pregnancy?","Archangel","294773","And I suppose you've read Roe v Wade huh? Then how do you explain this passage from the 1972 Abortion Act: 1972 American Bar Associations Uniform Abortion Act. This model law permitted abortions performed within [20] weeks after the commencement of the pregnancy [or after [20] weeks only if the physician has reasonable cause to believe (i) there is a substantial risk that continuance of the pregnancy would endanger the life of the mother or would gravely impair the physical or mental health of the mother, (ii) that the child would be born with grave physical or mental defect, or (iii) that the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest, or illicit intercourse with a girl under the age of 16 years]. From Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), note 40. These were the clear and justifiable reasons for abortion originally. It was not abortion for the sake of birth control originally. And how thick must one be not to realize that I have as much right as you do to voice my beliefs regarding abortion. What type of elitist are you to believe that women are the only members of our society who have the unconditional right to murder innocent members of that society without their motives or actions even being questioned?","abortion-self-defense","08:20 AM","abortion-debates","78"

"12-22-2007","10685",6,"None","None","None","thecap0","294802","ARCHIE, This model law... Do you even know what a MODEL LAW is? Do you even know that is nothing more than a proposal placed out as food for thought and consideration? Do you know that it did not then and does not today have the force of law anywhere, as it was never adopted in any jurisdiction? In my, and apparently your, opinion, however, it did not go far enough. I seem to remember that you quoted approvingly that Ole' Adam did not become human until ""God"" breathed the Breath of Life"" into him. Thanks for the ""Biblical"" support of what I have been saying all along, that personhood begins with the first breath.","abortion-self-defense","12:33 PM","abortion-debates","84"
"12-24-2007","10685",6,"Archangel","294059","I never argued about the worlds abortion numbers at all so don't expand the debate. And your army analogy is irrelevant because we're not talking about people getting shot which everyone in life works hard to avoid, but we're talking about having sex which everyone try's to make happen in their lives as regularly and as much as possible. So you couldn't come up with a more lousy analogy if you tried to. Who's having abortions (age)? 52% of women obtaining abortions in the U.S. are younger than 25: Women aged 20-24 obtain 32% of all abortions; Teenagers obtain 20%, girls under 15 account for 1.2%. Why women have abortions 1% of all abortions occur because of rape or incest; 6% of abortions occur because of potential health problems regarding either the mother or child, and 93% of all abortions occur for social reasons (i.e. the child is unwanted or inconvenient).","Shooterandproud","295013","The analogy was to unwanted pregnancies. You think people try to have as many unwanted pregnancies as possible? You couldn't come up with a worse interpretation if you tried to. Uhh, these two statistics are posted above by both jito and me and answer that question perfectly. Don't you read the posts before asking for more evidence? You can thank jito for the link as she posted it above. Why would I be inclined to believe that a pro-life anti-choice website is telling the truth? Why am I not surprised that they lump problems like no money to care for the child or that the mother will be beaten and abused if she has the child as ""social reasons""?","abortion-self-defense","04:03 PM","abortion-debates","86"
"12-24-2007","10685",6,"electrolyte","294114","Who is denigrating this ability? Only you, by regarding them merely as walking baby factories instead of people. We're pro- choice , not pro- abortion for everybody no matter what . Quit being such a dipstick and pretending that anybody is trying to make abortions mandatory... Keep ignoring me, Archie. I'm enjoying these free shots.","Shooterandproud","295014","I agree with electrolyte. The Pro-Choice crowd is not forcing anything. The pro-lifers are still free to not have abortions, while women who need them are. Therefore, both sides can do what they believe is right. However, the Anti choice crowd wants to force what they believe on everyone else, making it so that their and only their view is practiced, suppressing a womans right to her womb.","abortion-self-defense","04:24 PM","abortion-debates","87"

Oh really? Where, when, on what forum did I say this? Could you post a link to the precise post for me? Because I don't remember ever even debating the issue here or anywhere else. And just as a point of interest since you raised the issue, Adam didn't have a 9 month gestation period being the first person created and all, so I don't see how his circumstances have anything to do with when life begins in the womb. So I guess your back to being in a state of total confusion again as the bible doesn't support that life begins with the first breathe at all. Luk 1:41 When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. Luk 1:42 And she cried out with a loud voice and said, ""Blessed {are} you among women, and blessed {is} the fruit of your womb! Luk 1:44 ""For behold, when the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy.","abortion-self-defense","05:17 PM","abortion-debates","88"

So where was ""God"" funnin' us, with this verse, or with the ones you posted above? Seems like they can't both be true now, can they?","abortion-self-defense","06:27 PM","abortion-debates","89"
