"12-10-2007","10685",1,"None","None","None","Iuris","293270","Well, not quite self defense, but a similar institute, I'm not sure what it's called in english, but approximately ""dire need"" would be a possible translation. Self defense means that an otherwise illegal action made legar when used in defense against an unlawful attack. ""Dire need"" is similar, except a bit more limited. In our legal system, the distinction is that with dire need, the prevented harm must be greater than the inflicted harm. As example, a starving man could not be punished for stealing food to prevent his own death, if he has not caused the starvation. Applying this to abortion is, of course a more complex issue. By the rule, no doctor could be prosecuted for aborting in case the pregnancy threatens the woman's life, for example.","abortion-self-defense","03:12 AM","abortion-debates","2"

You can still be held accountable to manslaughter even if you accidently kill someone (i.e., hunting accidents). Intent of harm does not have to exist for there to be an action that you may need to defend yourself against.","abortion-self-defense","10:53 AM","abortion-debates","4"
"12-11-2007","10685",1,"None","None","None","Iuris","293401","Accidental abortions are rather rare, don't you think, Jito? It's true that abortion cannot be covered by self defense - because self defense is a specific instrument requiring an attack, something the foetus is not likely to be able to pull off. However, there are analogous legal instruments that are applicable. So, Steve's answer is not complete, either.","abortion-self-defense","02:48 AM","abortion-debates","5"

That is especially true in pregnancy. Of course a fetus does not intend to harm. (Frankly one lacks the ability to intend anything until well after their first birthday.) But that does not mean a pregnancy can't be a threat and that ending it isn't a way to defend oneself against that threat.","abortion-self-defense","09:56 AM","abortion-debates","6"

From web searching, I have seen some definitions of self-defense that include a requirement of intent, and others that don't. So, I am not sure of the legal structure. There are occasional examples in real life of people who can cause harm without intending to. An example I saw from a internet forum was of a man who was being shot at by a hunter who thought, from that far distance, that he was an aniimal. In those cases, one usually can resort to other methods to stop the harm being done. The case of self defense in abortion in unique for many reasons. First, one cannot exactly warn the fetus to tell it to stop harming you. There are very few options for stopping the threat to the woman's life or health other than abortion. Presumably, in threats that happen at a very late stage of pregnancy, premature birth or ceasarean section would be an option, but often times it is not (loss of blood would be much too risky). So, abortion is the only self-defense choice in many of these situations. Also, in barely any other situation I can think of (except for conjoined twins) is the other being imposing itself in on the life of another in so inextricable a way. Yes, the late-term potentially-mentally-existing fetus is innocent in that it intends no harm, but that does not mean that it will not cause harm. I think it should be the choice of the woman whether or not to sacrifice her life or major health for the fetus that she is already making the sacrifice in carrying. I can admire those who make major sacrifices of themselves for others, but I don't think that it should be made into law for them to do so.","abortion-self-defense","10:53 AM","abortion-debates","7"

But if the mothers life is threatened by the pregnancy, I as a pro-life advocate would never condemn that ""early term abortion"" from taking place. A pregnancy should not equate to a death penalty. It's the wholesale destruction of life which makes up the majority of the abortions that take place each year so women either wont be inconvenienced by the pregnancy, or because they don't want to change their partying lifestyle yet, or because they don't want their bodies to go through the permanent changes women's bodies go through due to child birth such as wider hips, a stomach ponch and sagging breasts. Vanity is one of the main motivators of abortions by todays American women, whether they admit it or not. They know in their hearts that is true in more than 90% of all abortions. Statistically, under 3% of all abortions are due to the health of the woman being threatened, and many of those are more for justification rather than true threats to her health.","abortion-self-defense","11:08 AM","abortion-debates","8"

However, the claim that all other abortions are carried out because women are partying or vain is vile, insulting, false and one of the worst examples of misogyny I have seen in a long, long while. (Pity whatever fool of a woman ends up or ended up with you.) Granted - this is typical of a lifer who really cares not a whit about women or children - only in maintaining their supposed moral superiority. There are lots of reasons women abort - you can help by trying to address them or you can generalize, trivialize and insult. One will actually help the women and potentially her baby - the other allows you to pat yourself on the back.","abortion-self-defense","12:10 PM","abortion-debates","9"
"12-11-2007","10685",1,"Archangel","293521","My point stands, as does the truth of what motivates women to get so many unneeded abortions. If that truth is ugly, it's your truth, because the minute you agree that less than 3% of all abortions are health related then you must admit that the reasons I gave are valid in over 90% of the remaining abortions each year.","jitobear","293525","I don't HAVE to do anything but stay white and die.

But since when are they the real reason that motivates the woman. Last night I got a call from a Political Surveyor who asked me multiple questions regarding this election cycle. One set of questions were about what issues were most important to me regarding the Presidential election. I said that all of them were valid and important issues that I cared about, about 8 in total. She responded that I was allowed to pick as many as 3 issues that I cared about but the program didn't allow for me to pick all of them. So it is with the questionnaires every woman who gets an abortion must fill out. They have questions about why they are seeking it but not one option is to prevent wide hips, sagging boobs, a ponch stomach or not ready to stop partying, drinking or drugging. Those options aren't even made available to choose as the real reasons why women abort their babies so in your World, they don't even exist. Talk about being told what you must think and buying it hook line and sinker. Get out of that box jito, it has to be awfully tight in there.","abortion-self-defense","05:42 PM","abortion-debates","14"
