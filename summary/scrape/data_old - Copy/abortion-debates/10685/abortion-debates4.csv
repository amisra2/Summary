They are full of men and women looking to get first get loaded and then get laid. It has become an integral part of our American Culture. So who are you trying to kid here anyway? Because surely you don't live in either a convent or a cave. So please don't treat me like I do either. Now you can lie to yourself and to each other all you like but if the VAST MAJORITY of women 21-39 weren't filling our bars and nightclubs 5 nights a week, then these businesses wouldn't be so busy with not only steady clienteles but growing clienteles.","Shooterandproud","293951","Um, have you ever thought that maybe a lot of them are just there just to go out and have a drink with some friends? Even if someone went there looking for a guy or a girl, how are you so sure that they want to get drunk and have sex as fast as possible? *Patiently waits for proof*","abortion-self-defense","11:46 PM","abortion-debates","46"

So you have statistics to back up your points? Even if I weren't automatically disinclined to believe you because you've proven yourself to have as much credibility as a flea has mass, I unfortunately know a fair handful of women who accidentally became pregnant, and every single one had a steady boyfriend and didn't end up in that position by being sluts or due to drunken clubbing.","abortion-self-defense","12:15 AM","abortion-debates","47"

People with no common sense nor the ability or desire to recognize the obvious need someone else to tell them what to think. You people can remain in denial of reality but we have hundreds of thousands of Bars and clubs, both straight and gay throughout this Country, and they are all packed to overflowing 5 out of 7 nights a week, every week of the year. If you actually think that the vast majority are there just for a drink with friends then you explain why we have millions of abortions each year by mostly single unattached women?

The only thing more disgusting to me than your posts would be any attempt to ban them. By all means, let the world see just how absurd your POV really is; let the world see that your POV stems from a desire to control others, women especially; let the world see that your POV stems from a Pauline hatred of sex.

And my all time favorite, if I hate abortions so much, how many children have i personally adopted? Why is defending the voiceless innocent who can't defend themselves against murderers who will gladly promote their infanticide while these same abortionists will protest en-masse to prevent the execution of a mass murderer wanting to control all women or all people in your opinion? Why isn't it exactly what it is in that we want to save perfectly healthy, innocent children who who are being carried by perfectly healthy women? And regarding adoptions, my own sister adopted 2 children, one Amerasian, and that was 21 years ago. But more recently than that young acquaintances have investigated adopting a white baby, because they are white and were told that if one came available at all, it would be at least 5 years before their name worked its way up on the list if they applied right then. And to allow 2 years for a minority child due to the length of the list. So I'll tell you what is a fact. If your pro-infanticide side would agree to support the banning of all abortions except for the real and true health of the mother, I could get 5 million names of people who would agree to adopt babies if there was an overflow of children after all of those who want to adopt get first dibs.

And supports precisely what I have been saying all along. UNITED STATES Number of abortions per year: 1.37 Million (1996) Number of abortions per day: Approximately 3,700 Who's having abortions (age)? ]52% of women obtaining abortions in the U.S. are younger than 25: Women aged 20-24 obtain 32% of all abortions; Teenagers obtain 20% girls under 15 account for 1.2%. Why women have abortions 1% of all abortions occur because of rape or incest; 6% of abortions occur because of potential health problems regarding either the mother or child, and 93% of all abortions occur for social reasons (i.e. the child is unwanted or inconvenient). having abortions (income)? Women with family incomes less than $15,000 obtain 28.7% of all abortions; Women with family incomes between $15,000 and $29,999 obtain 19.5%; Women with family incomes between $30,000 and $59,999 obtain 38.0%; Women with family incomes over $60,000 obtain 13.8%. Likelihood of abortion: estimated 43% of all women will have at least 1 abortion by the time they are 45 years old. 47% of all abortions are performed on women who have had at least one previous abortion. None of these statistics support your contentions for why so many abortions occur and repeatedly by the same women. And if you'll notice the income level of those getting them, it is the higher income women who are getting the most abortions, so poverty isn't the reason for the majority of them. And besides, if you look at the number of teens getting abortions, that number correlates fine with the under 15,000 annual income level because most teenagers (20% statistic) don't even have jobs so of course they statistically would appear to be in poverty. But they aren't at all as they still live at home. You have accidently defeated yourself jito by actually posting an objective web site. One I didn't think even existed. But your own numbers show that the assumptions you make above are false and a corruption of reality according to your own link. Which I have re-posted for your convenience. Thanks for making my case for me. http://www.abortionno.org/Resources/fastfacts.html","abortion-self-defense","01:30 PM","abortion-debates","55"

What a crock. The domain name is abortion no . It repeatedly refers to the fetus as the ""child."" One of the tabs at the top of the site is a Bible verse. Here's one of my favorite parts: So everything that isn't rape/incest or physical health problems qualifies as ""social reasons""? Being mentally and/or emotionally unprepared is a ""social reason""? Being too poor to properly raise a child is a ""social reason""? Out of curiosity, how many of those that actually are bona fide ""social reasons"" are only issues because of hatemongers and religious nutjobs who rail against abortion and lambaste those who simply want to have the best living situations for their families? I am also not surprised that even your ""objective"" site doesn't support your blustering about bars. In fact, you've still completely failed to support your Bos excrement.

And your army analogy is irrelevant because we're not talking about people getting shot which everyone in life works hard to avoid, but we're talking about having sex which everyone try's to make happen in their lives as regularly and as much as possible. So you couldn't come up with a more lousy analogy if you tried to. Uhh, these two statistics are posted above by both jito and me and answer that question perfectly.
