"01-26-2008","10685",14,"Archangel","298634","Not at all lesz, and just because you reject it doesn't make it so at all. And everything you have said here is nothing more than your opinion lesz. What makes you believe your opinion is any more valid than mine? What typical cr*p to infer that I am arguing for the right to rape. What I am doing here is showing that men have absolutely no reproductive rights at all. That under every and all circumstances, the woman can be as sexually irresponsible as the man and still either profit from the pregnancy or end it if that is what suits her, with no regard or concern at all given to either the unborn child itself, or the father who is fully half responsible for the existence of the unborn child existing in the womb. So you can minimize the value of the child and the man lesz, and you have done it quite well, but that doesn't validate or justify your bigoted opinion which relegates children and men to nothing more than objects to be abused and/or discarded by the women who are in no way victims here but equal participants in the problem existing. So why is the man left with no power at all to determine the fate of the pregnancy? A special case that 1) she caused by her own actions. And 2) that affects two other people also as in the Father and the Child. And in the child's situation, his very life is on the line. Since when doesn't a human life trump the convenience of another person? And the above paragraphs is what I get for a response. If you were even trying to be honest and objective, you would just admit that there is no scenario where men are treated fairly in the area of reproductive rights.","lesz","298739","Well, I pointed out all the holes in your assertions, and you filled none of them in. I gave you good reasons, not one of which you bothered yourself to address. I think about and justify it. Nope. You are asserting the ""right"" of a man to force a woman he has made pregnant to go through with pregnancy. That is the right to rape. Congratulations! They don't have any reproductive rights. You are not guaranteed a right to reproduce. That's a privilege you earn by persuading some woman to have children with you. Get over it. If she withdraws her permission, you know what? You are SOL. Life is SO UNFAIR!!! Get over it already. Anyone who can claim a woman ""profits"" from a pregnancy is not firing on all cylinders, nor does he understand what pregnancy entails. Well, no surprise there. Yes, the man is responsible for any baby he fathered; no, he doesn't have the right to force a woman to bear his child. What's your problem with that? Sweetie, I don't minimise anything. I merely point out that the rights of the foetus and the man are not equal to those of the woman, and I provided many arguments to support that, none of which you have bothered to answer. Because it's not his body! Duh! Didn't they teach you the difference between ""mine"" and ""yours"" in school? First of all, rape and conception are not caused by a woman's voluntary actions. Women never consent to rape by definition, and they do not always consent to pregnancy. Second, we are not talking about a child; we are talking about a foetus. It can't even think or feel at the time abortion is legal. It isn't a person with the same rights as a person. Sweetums, I've been perfectly honest and direct. I've told you what i believe, and I've explained why I believe it. You haven't even come close to understanding what I've been saying, let alone making an argument against it. And no, men and women are not equal in terms of reproductive rights. That's just a fact of life you have to live with, just as you have to learn to live without a vagina or womb. They aren't yours to steal whenever the hell you feel like it. So bug off.","abortion-self-defense","08:45 AM","abortion-debates","197"

I personally have adopted three children (ages 5, 8, and 10 at the times of each adoption). How much have you done? How many of these children have you adopted or provided for? As you answer is likely ""none"", you are a hypocrite.","Shooterandproud","302194","Well, the embryo has not mental existance, neither does the plant. I guess they're not so similar, because the embryo is more parasitic, the plant can live on its own. Just because they're DNA is different, doesn't make the analogy ""disgusting"". Well, considering I'm a teenager, I can't really adopt children. Again, see above. I don't think you can legally adopt children at 14. How about learning a little more about me before you start calling me a hypocrite.","abortion-self-defense","01:34 PM","abortion-debates","199"

Point One: Hyperbole and emotional histrionics. You are now trying for emotional histrionics, which obviously mean that you do not have a honest argument to present instead. Two outright lies in your paragraph. One is that embryos and fetuses are NOT Children. You are blatantly misrepresenting developmental stages here. Secondly, nobody here have defended murder, nobody have defended the illegal killing of persons. Or is it that you are not a dishonest lying anti-choicer but rather are incredibly ignorant and didn't know the meanings of the words you used? You must then mean 7 weeks after birth, right? After all, ""baby"" is a biological/medical descriptor of a newborn. You can not possibly refer to the embryo, as it is not a baby. mttu is not exactly a reliable, honest site to use as a reference. Or didn't you know that you have to be a little bit careful about your sources to retain credibility? Now, I know this doesn't matter to you, because we already know that anti-choicers go for emotional histrionics rather than reality and honesty, so of course you don't care about your sources. After all, why would you get so excited about fetal porn otherwise? But it doesn't answer the question about sentience which was the question you were answering. How does fetal porn evidence anything about sentience? Yup, all about fetal porn shock value. You forgot to put verification on these pictures, to show how these are not Chinese term abortions, miscarriages or plastic models and whatever the anti-choice pack of liars usually go for. Once again, regardless of your emotional histrionics and dishonesty/ignorance, these are not babies, neither are they murdered. Any other stupid fallacies you want to present here? And since you would never have an abortion, why are YOU arguing about this? Butt out and stop your attempt at enslaving and controlling women. Drop your infliction of your misogynistic theocracy on women.","abortion-self-defense","10:13 PM","abortion-debates","201"

The best we can work towards are services easily available in every state, coupled with widespread realistic family planning and sex education, services that make child rearing easier and more affordable (for example, affordable childcare, universal pre-k, universal health care, employment options for working mothers), and of course, RTLers are free to try to convince others to go their route instead. But women must have the right to choose and the conditions that make choice a real thing. Whether one opts for children or not.","abortion-self-defense","10:38 PM","abortion-debates","207"
"03-27-2008","10685",14,"jitobear","293499","True - most abortions are not due serious health/life risks - and there is much room for debate as to what other situations are valid enough to warrant abortion or could be addressed in other ways (my favorite method of decreasing abortion). However, the claim that all other abortions are carried out because women are partying or vain is vile, insulting, false and one of the worst examples of misogyny I have seen in a long, long while. (Pity whatever fool of a woman ends up or ended up with you.) Granted - this is typical of a lifer who really cares not a whit about women or children - only in maintaining their supposed moral superiority. There are lots of reasons women abort - you can help by trying to address them or you can generalize, trivialize and insult. One will actually help the women and potentially her baby - the other allows you to pat yourself on the back.","Existantia","306880","Well said Jitobear.

A baby is something natural to the body, the only time the body is threatened is when a foreign object has invaded the body, and is causing damage. A baby is not causing damage to the body, as a matter of fact it is something that the body itself made with the help of a sexual partner(and I'm not talking about those who have health issues. A lot of you would love to take the easy way out and jump on that well used, and overrated train.). So claiming self-defence in this instance would be walking along the lines of paranoia, and insanity all in one. Anyone sticking to this line of thinking may need a few good psychic pills.","abortion-self-defense","01:36 AM","abortion-debates","209"
