I have every right to them and to voice them here without proving that anyone else agrees with me at all in order to voice them. So there is nothing to concede as my beliefs are self evident. It would be nice though if you could prove that the results of surveys the abortion industry does to support their own predetermined outcomes weren't fixed and loaded to confirm precisely the results they want to come up with. Of course you will ignore that aspect of this as ignorance is bliss to your side of the issue.","jitobear","293772","Any man who believes that the most worrisome thing on a woman's mind when facing pregnancy is her breasts is not a man with whom I would wish to bond. The men I associate with regard women far higher. Yes - your beliefs are self-evident. You believe abortion is wrong and you believe women are empty-headed twits who spend their time worrying about their rack (who knows - maybe that is true for the women in your life.) But I am not talking about beliefs . I are talking about why women choose abortion. You made an accusation you have yet to back up with anything at all . One that I have completely discredited. It is that particular argument that you need to concede since you have proven NOTHING. And I would like to point out to you AGAIN - that they most thorough stats I provided came from a PRO-LIFE website.","abortion-self-defense","01:50 PM","abortion-debates","32"

Not all women, only those women who will kill their own offspring so as not to inconvenience themselves after it is they who acted irresponsibly, not the babies they so easily murder in the name of controlling their own bodies.

Surely not me. Neither of my daughters is married nor have they had children. You seem to read alot into my posts Capo, stop interpreting and start reading my posts if you can. It will help you appear more lucid, which at this point you don't appear to be. And where have I once attempted to impose my beliefs on anyone? Are you on drugs Capo? I have expressed my opinion on a debate forum and I will continue to. If you don't like that then refute them but don't you dare tell me not to share my beliefs and opinions because you just don't carry that kind of power here, at least not with me.

I will be happy to publicize the fact that there is a wacko on this forum who has theabsurd belief that some nameless, faceless governmenrt bureaucrat is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is.

Just because because you say it, think it, or believe it does not mean that it is clearly anything outside of your ramblings, thoughts and beliefs. I'd like to see how you'd handle the government interfering with your dick. In any case. This simply confirms for me what I accused you of earlier. That your stance on abortion is complete self-gratification. You really don't give a damn about women facing unwanted pregnancies or their babies at all. You simply continue to trivialize what they are going through, generalize about as to their character with absolutely no evidence to back up these character assisinations and you offer zero solutions - just condemnation. I have a long list of ideas for addressing unwanted pregnancy and abortion - and not one them involves trivializing or insulting anybody. When I see evidence that this is an issue that you actually care about for a reason other than serving your own ego, I will share them with you. You did no such thing. You kept making the claim. You have not backed up your claim at all. Another accusation. Back it up. Now I did just a tich of poking around. Looked at two pro-life websites to see who they reference as their source for their stats. They site the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health organization that is pro-choice. I glanced through several of their reports to see how they obtained data. It was through independent studies - not clinic questionaires. http://www.guttmacher.org/sections/a...hp?pub=reports","abortion-self-defense","04:22 PM","abortion-debates","36"

"12-14-2007","10685",3,"Archangel","293543","Jito, of course all of the reasons you mention are the staple excuses that are normally given. But since when are they the real reason that motivates the woman. Last night I got a call from a Political Surveyor who asked me multiple questions regarding this election cycle. One set of questions were about what issues were most important to me regarding the Presidential election. I said that all of them were valid and important issues that I cared about, about 8 in total. She responded that I was allowed to pick as many as 3 issues that I cared about but the program didn't allow for me to pick all of them. So it is with the questionnaires every woman who gets an abortion must fill out. They have questions about why they are seeking it but not one option is to prevent wide hips, sagging boobs, a ponch stomach or not ready to stop partying, drinking or drugging. Those options aren't even made available to choose as the real reasons why women abort their babies so in your World, they don't even exist. Talk about being told what you must think and buying it hook line and sinker. Get out of that box jito, it has to be awfully tight in there.","Shooterandproud","293930","Saying women get unwanted pregnancies from partying and drugging is like saying black people steal. Even though a large percentage of the prison population is black, it doesn't mean black people in general steal. That would be a malicious stereotype. Saying that women get unwanted pregnancies from partying and drugging, especially with absolutely no evidence, is stereotypical and sexist.","abortion-self-defense","09:23 PM","abortion-debates","39"
"12-14-2007","10685",3,"Archangel","293557","Have you ever seen an abortion questionnaire sinjin? What I'm trying to show you is common sense, something the left is sorely lacking. It's like when lyte argued that statistically atheists make up less that 1% of our Prison population, and produced ""ACTUAL SO CALLED STATISTICS"", But ask yourself this just for the sake of common sense. How many benefits do atheists get in prison compared to men who want out of their cells for bible studies, church services and worship services. The Christians also have access to special programs that lead to early release and community service points that lead to early release. And as the coup de graux, how many convicts want to go before the parole board labeled as godless heathens who don't even believe in God? NONE OF THEM, THAT'S HOW MANY. So like typical atheists and the smart criminals they are, they lie like hell and call themselves christians who just made a mistake. Well, you can be sure that if we could get a thousand of these so called christians here for a Poll, they would relate a lot better with you atheists than they would with me. And so it is with the questionnaires of abortion clinics. The questions on it are designed to manipulate the outcome to appear as innocent and morally right as possible. But we all know that is a blatant lie. It's just that some prefer the lie to the truth which is why such distorted statistics exist in the first place.","Shooterandproud","293932","Again, assumptions, assumptions, assumptions. Just because you DON'T KNOW if most women get pregnant by partying etc., doesn't mean they do. Same with atheists in prison. Just because you don't know if that statistic is true, doesn't mean that there are much more prison atheists.","abortion-self-defense","09:28 PM","abortion-debates","40"
"12-14-2007","10685",3,"Archangel","293644","I assure you jito my wife is a real woman. And my 2 daughters are fine independent women who love me very much. They have good healthy self images with good healthy relationships with me so they never had to go out and prove they can be loved by having physical relationships with men and having random sex in order to feel like complete women who can be loved by a man. If you had an ounce of understanding why so many American women are promiscuous, with no self respect at all, you wouldn't be defending and justifying abortion, but would be talking about how to rebuild within women a morality based value system in order to stop the all out human carnage taking place in our abortion clinics due to the out of control and irresponsible sex that is taking place in this Country, and around the World. Just because I'm only speaking about the USA, it doesn't mean Europe and Asia is innocent in any way.","Shooterandproud","293933","Archie, I think its time to go see Doc Brown so you can hang out with all the people you can agree with you a couple of centuries back.","abortion-self-defense","09:38 PM","abortion-debates","41"

And who is filling them 5 out of 7 nights a week? NUNS and VIRGINS? I think not. They are full of men and women looking to get first get loaded and then get laid. It has become an integral part of our American Culture. So who are you trying to kid here anyway? Because surely you don't live in either a convent or a cave. So please don't treat me like I do either. Why do you think they call those places meat markets ? Because guys go there for intellectual stimulation? NOW DID I SAY WOMEN GO OUT TO PURPOSELY GET PREGNANT JUST TO EXPERIENCE ABORTIONS? OF COURSE NOT. But they do go out to party and get laid, and lo and behold when they end up getting pregnant they just figure it's easier to abort than to mess with their lives as they can easily rationalize why they don't want an unplanned baby. But we all know the reality is that they aren't ready to change their partying lifestyle and take responsibility for their actions. Now you can lie to yourself and to each other all you like but if the VAST MAJORITY of women 21-39 weren't filling our bars and nightclubs 5 nights a week, then these businesses wouldn't be so busy with not only steady clienteles but growing clienteles.","abortion-self-defense","09:49 PM","abortion-debates","43"
