I've seen ads for a number of religious organizations (that are presumably pro-life) asking to support a fund for such unfortunate children. However, as we've seen in the past, how much of that money actually goes toward helping those children is substantially less impressive. What I find reprehensible is that we have these people thumping their Bibles and squealing of righteousness but who would rather donate large sums of money to have a ridiculously swanky and over-the-top place that's empty for all but three hours of the week where they can get together and pat themselves on the back for their righteousness... instead of doing something productive with their money. I've said it for years, and I'll say it again here: Imagine if all of the money that goes into obligatory Christmas gifts, cards, and decorations, into donations to the already disgustingly and wastefully wealthy faux-charity organizations, and into contributions to unneeded, egotistical projects went toward things like helping the hungry or the homeless, or promoting education. A scenario I like to use in my class is: if people would just educate themselves about things like basic physics and general biology, then the frauds and quacks that make their livings by hackery (like the ""free energy"" proponents and Kevin Trudeau) wouldn't be getting enough money to continue their bullspitting campaigns that work to get even more of your money.","abortion-self-defense","07:15 PM","abortion-debates","123"

Can you prove or show how a life form no more complex than a fungus miraculously becomes a sentient being as all of the people on this forum are now in the last trimester of pregnancy? I mean, since your earliest memories haven't you watched yourself grow from one stage of development to another? Didn't you go from being a toddler to an adolescent? And from an adolescent to a teen? And on and on? Did you just go to sleep one night and wake up the next morning in a different stage of life? I think not. You grew and developed and went from stage to stage. So how can you treat the development an unborn child goes from conception to birth is any different a growth and development process than any other stage of growth we experience in life? It makes no sense at all shooter. Now regarding this charitable giving; talk about a sweeping generalization designed to condemn a whole segment of Society! How unfair and inaccurate you are to boot. Here is some evidence that proves that conservatives out give liberals on all counts with pretty conclusive and sweeping evidence. http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=2682730 Sioux Falls vs. San Francisco We assume the rich give more than the middle class, the middle class more than the poor. I've heard liberals care more about the less fortunate, so we assume they give more than conservatives do. Are these assumptions truth, or myth? To test what types of people give more, ""20/20"" went to two very different parts of the country, with contrasting populations: Sioux Falls, S.D. and San Francisco, Calif. The Salvation Army set up buckets at the busiest locations in each city -- Macy's in San Francisco and Wal-Mart in Sioux Falls. Which bucket collected more money? Sioux Falls is rural and religious; half of the population goes to church every week. People in San Francisco make much more money, are predominantly liberal, and just 14 percent of people in San Francisco attend church every week. Liberals are said to care more about helping the poor; so did people in San Francisco give more? It turns out that this idea that liberals give moreis a myth. Of the top 25 states where people give an above average percent of their income, 24 were red states in the last presidential election. And here are some other links, this one below by a liberal who hated to reveal his findings about who gives more in reality. http://www.beliefnet.com/story/204/story_20419_1.html http://www.blogsofwar.com/2006/11/17...re-to-charity/","abortion-self-defense","07:37 PM","abortion-debates","124"

A ""liberal"" who was more recently registered as a Republican than he was as a Democrat (but says that he is not comfortable describing himself as either)? And he didn't say he hated to reveal it, he said that his former views would have made him hate to present it. So after all this hubbub about stepping up your debating integrity, you can't even present a nondescript review from a religious source in a way that doesn't twist and skew the facts, and it took you all of one sentence to do it. What ""charities""? Did he count giving to church organizations? If you donate $1000 to your church to build a new waste of space, does that count for as much as my donation of $1000 to a charity that helps people who are down and out?","abortion-self-defense","09:50 PM","abortion-debates","125"

I mean, if I aggravate you so much and am so dishonest and ignorant, then why haven't you just put me on ignore?

"01-21-2008","10685",9,"Shooterandproud","293196","In situations where carrying out a pregnancy can cause health problems or death to a pregnant woman, does abortion count as self-defense? In a real life situation, if you have are carrying a weapon, and someone tries to kidnap/mug/assault/kill you, you are justified in killing them. Why should this not apply to abortion. If someone or something is trying or going to harm you, do you not have a right to protect yourself?","ServantOfChrist","298149","No. It is murder in all cases. It can be somewat justifiable in a very few cases, but they are so negligible that they should not be taken into account when considering whether or not to allow abortion.","abortion-self-defense","01:58 AM","abortion-debates","129"

Here is evidence that brain activity in fetuses is measurable and testable. http://www.uams.edu/today/2002/090602/fetal.htm And this value distinction plays out in life also as coma victims that show measurable brain activity are kept alive long enough for the body to heal and repair itself. They aren't just disconnected as if they are no longer alive. We have learned so much about basic human biology today that it is completely hypocritical for the pro abortionist to then deny that a fetus is alive and anything less than a developing full and complete human being from conception. The moment the egg is fertilized, life is then present and the child is then growing into a unique individual with all of the potential of everyone who will ever read this post. After all, at one time in each of our very lives, we were all in exactly the same place as that fetus we are now discussing. Talk about irrational hubris and arrogance that it takes to deny that fetus the same respect that we demand for ourselves as sentient beings when we know beyond any doubt at all that we started out exactly as they are now. I do deny that the brain has anything to do with our sentience as human beings. The brain is necessary to determine the quality of the lives we live in this body, but not that we are alive. For example, children are born with partial brains, or even no brains at all. The family might decide that no extraordinary efforts be made to keep such a baby alive, but if the baby survives once disconnected from life support, Neither the parents nor the hospital have the right to just kill it. That is evidence that according to our moral and ethical laws, life is not determined by ones ability to think.","abortion-self-defense","11:21 AM","abortion-debates","134"

YOU have learned squat about biology, and you refuse to hear it when I try to teach you. No, what is hypocritical is to call something ""developing"" and then -- without interspersing even a single word -- call it ""full and complete."" ""We"" all started out with the atoms that compose our bodies spread amongst miscellaneous locations on the earth. Carbon dioxide in the air was changed into carbohydrates via photosynthesis, then, the carbohydrates were ingested and converted by your father into a spermatozoon that fertilized an egg. How dare you disrespect the carbon? Is God a murderer when a miscarriage occurs? So people born with only brain stems are sentient? Really?
