My only reason for originally posting info on children born without brains was to show how they were treated by the medical professionals who had to care for them based on the legal and social norms we live by in this Society. I showed that we don't just dispose of brain dead people as we dispose of tumors. That we treat them with respect and don't kill them but allow them to die a natural death. Remember that the link I posted in making the point I did regarding the soul and sentience of the child was the link that showed normally developing fetuses that show brain functions and activity that directly refutes the pro-abortionists claims that the unborn children who face abortion are not like us in that they have no brain functions nor can they feel pain. My problem here is that for every point i make that proves the unborn are miniatures of us, someone changes the boundaries of the debate and attempts to redefine the arguments being made.","electrolyte","298343","Looks to me like he was responding to you, not responding to what I said. 10) Claiming to be an victim when you are losing 11) Claiming everyone is lying or distorting what you say (especially when you fail to provide evidence or meet challenges to prove this) And I simply pointed out that I do the same with my property, showing that this treatment is not sufficient for proving life, let alone sentience. 7) Stop pretending that refutations of your posts don't exist I also note that you haven't addressed the difference between sentience and life as Ao explained. You haven't shown that brain function is synonymous with sentience. 7) Stop pretending that refutations of your posts don't exist 11) Claiming everyone is lying or distorting what you say (especially when you fail to provide evidence or meet challenges to prove this) But the link said nothing about the soul and sentience. 8) Stop relying on lies, frauds and hoaxes (Freaky Links anyone?) Where do pro-choicers say that all fetuses at any stage of development have no brain function? This is the second time I've asked you this question, Archie. Put up or shut up. 7) Stop pretending that refutations of your posts don't exist 8) Stop relying on lies, frauds and hoaxes (Freaky Links anyone?) Other than that fetuses are potential humans, you haven't proven anything. 8) Stop relying on lies, frauds and hoaxes (Freaky Links anyone?) Every time I've questioned your assumed necessary correlation between the presence of brain tissue, the presence of brain activity, and sentience, you've failed to address it. 10) Claiming to be an victim when you are losing 11) Claiming everyone is lying or distorting what you say (especially when you fail to provide evidence or meet challenges to prove this)","abortion-self-defense","04:00 PM","abortion-debates","151"
"01-22-2008","10685",11,"Another opinion","None","The fetuses whose brain patterns were measured in that article had gestational ages of 28-36 weeks. That is the end of second trimester / beginning of third trimester. Indeed, I have posted links myself in the past the show that the brain starts getting sufficiently capable of potential mind / sentience at roughly the beginning of the third trimester. As I have mentioned in numerous posts within this forum, I personally would start valuing the fetus's rights over the rights of the woman to her body once the fetus gains the capabilities of having some level of mind - roughly around the beginning of that third trimester - and would therefore place restrictions on third trimester abortions.","Archangel","298347","Hi Ao, let me try to explain the inconsistency in what I see as the prochoicers attitude regarding this third trimester acceptance of a fetus value while continuing to deny the inherent value of first and second trimester babies, especially today. I'm sure that you are as aware as I am of the blood tests and fetal monitoring tests that Dr's perform on pregnant women that allow them to determine very early on that the baby being carried is healthy or not. They are able to determine abnormalities, birth defects and diseases that aren't physically evident at all. So when a baby gets a clean bill of health at as young as 8 to 12 weeks into the pregnancy it is well known at that time that this woman is carrying a healthy viable child. So how is it that we can treat the young fetus as if it is nothing more than a tumor to be removed and discarded prior to the 3rd trimester when as intelligent people who have seen billions of birthing experiences in reality, we know all too well that the outcome of this childs gestation period will end in a beautiful new born child if left to grow to term. Yet somehow some are able to rationalize that only once the brain waves can be measured does that qualify the child as being worthy of being afforded rights. For me personally, I know that from the very first discovery that my wife was pregnant did I worry about the welfare and health of my unborn daughters. The thought never entered my mind that they weren't worth worrying about until a test could be performed that proved they had testable brain activity.","abortion-self-defense","05:50 PM","abortion-debates","152"

Namely, it is not as much what the zygote is AT THAT MOMENT that matters as much as what it will become - a person like you and me. As I mentioned before, I and many other pro-choice propents do value that potential (and I wish that more pro-choice proponents here would admit to it), but not as much as we value the right of the mother to her own body. It is a value judgement that I know you disagree with. Potential can be a beautiful thing but it is also a matter of degree. After all, unfertilized eggs also have the potential to become full people. The only extra step they require that the zygote already went through is that fertilization step (unless one believes in a soul, where the entrance of a soul is a critical step). Even once the egg is fertilized, there is apparently a fairly large percentage of zygotes that simply do not progress through full pregnancy due to biological reasons. Since it is potential that you value and since you presumably also believe that there is a soul that enters at conception that gives it sentience, then let me ask you a hypothetical question. If a zygote was conceived without a spiritual soul and the mother's body for whatever reason somehow biologically kept the zygote from growing - so it would remain forever a zygote (or even first trimester fetus for that matter) with no potential of becoming more - would you still value its life over the rights of the mother to her body? If so, then what in that non-developing soul-less zygote or early fetus is it that you would be valuing so much? I ask this question to see if there is anything you value beyond the early fetus's potential (shared by many on the pro-choice side but not nearly as strongly) and beyond its soul (a belief not shared by most pro-choice proponents for early fetuses).","abortion-self-defense","06:21 PM","abortion-debates","153"

This is a proven reality so to place more emphasis on the woman's right to kill her own offspring when it was her irresponsible action that caused the problem. It defies logic that the innocent party can be killed by the party that created the problem in the first place. Where is your sense of justice? This unfertilized egg argument is a red herring Ao, I personally have never even thought about eggs that aren't fertilized being potential people, and don't consider them anything more than what a woman washes out with her menstrual cycle. Life is life, and that occurs when the egg becomes fertilized. At that point it starts to grow into what we are now. It is at a stage that we can both relate to as we ourselves were there once. Every single sentient human being was once precisely what you are arguing deserves no rights because of its current stage of development. That is both denial of reality and hypocrisy at the highest levels. Not to mention hubris and arrogance when we ourselves would deny the same rights to life that we are currently very thankful were afforded to us. Again, so what. Who cares? They are a non issue as they never took. They were never able to grab life and start to grow so no harm, no foul as they say. Regarding the bolded: I think you have just described a form of cancer. It has no soul, it will never mature into a baby but will remain within her as a non developing soulless zygote? I don't care what you call it, if it was my wife carrying it, I would want it removed as you define it. Either way it isn't a child which possesses the characteristics of its parents. So to summarize, let's not complicate it. A healthy first trimester fetus has the same exact potential as a healthy third trimester fetus which has the same potential as a healthy infant which has the same potential as a toddler, and so on and so forth. The only thing they all need is the opportunity to reach independent life.

It defies logic that the ""potential human being"" should have rights because it is a developing human being but we should deny the rights of the actual human being for it. Denying the rights of a full-fledged human being in favor of a potential human being is both denial of reality and hypocrisy of the highest level. I'm serious. Absolute hypocrisy. You mean the rights you're wanting to take away? What about when a fertilized egg doesn't implant? What about miscarriages? If you truly believe that life and humanity begin at conception, then those zygotes should get all of these rights according to your position. When zygotes don't develop through no fault of the mother, is God murdering these ""potential humans""? Will you please, please tell us about how well-versed in biology you are again? Pretty please? If you don't want to complicate things, then stop saying things that are statistically untrue. The chances of abortive complications arising in the first trimester is greater than in the third trimester.

But the law has entered in this area, and in pretty much every other area of our Society, so what are you talking about? Do you think that abortions should be allowed at any stage of the gestation period? And who decides which limitations or exceptions are right? THE LAW DOES. That's what makes us a civilized Society. Without laws, we are left with chaos. Are you not familiar with the Supreme Court decision referred to as the Roe V Wade decision of 1/22/73? Here's a link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade Abortion was legalized at that time and was illegal prior to that decision.

The main difference in our outlook is how we look at what the zygote or early fetus is AT THAT MOMENT, not counting potential for what it will become in the future. I suspect that your belief in a soul residing in the zygote or early fetus makes you automatically attach certain aspects to it without even realising that it is because of the belief in that soul that you attach those aspects. The main aspect is the idea that there is ""somebody home"" in that zygote or early embryo - that it is not just a body, but an early version of a person in there. I think that that is the reason that you use words such as ""innocent"" and ""justice"". Again, you must remember that, for those of us who do not share your belief in a soul residing in the early fetus, it is really just a body at that stage so that the ONLY thing it has going for it is what it will become in the future, not what it is at that point in time. That is a very big difference in outlook. Presumably, you might think that there is some sense of suffering, fear or loss that the fetus itself might feel if it is aborted and I would think that any such thoughts would have to stem from religious belief in a soul. If the early fetus would have no soul, then you might also agree that, at that early point in time, the biology is not yet ready for it to have any mental existence - no suffering, no fear, no pain, no emotions or thoughts of any kind whatsoever, conscious or subconscious. Without that mental existence, concepts such as ""innocence"" or ""justice"" just cannot apply. I was trying to think up an analogy for you so that you can understand the point of view but I suspect that, if I presented an analogy of a zygote conceived without a soul, then you might think that it never will achieve sentience - that a soul is necessary for sentience. However, imagine a soul that itself spiritually develops - starting off as only a spark of energy that accompanies life, and only later on gaining some sense of sentience or mind of any kind, conscious or subconscious. In that scenario, you might also agree that the early fetus without any sentience or mind cannot suffer, fear, have any emotions or thoughts or mind of any kind so it can neither be guilty nor innocent, or have any sense of injustice until it gains that sentience. That is equivalent to where we stand in our view. I personally don't view myself as having existed as a person - as ""me"" - until I did so mentally. Before that, there was just a living body with ""nobody home"". It is those first sparks of mentality that determined my beginnings as a person. If, for whatever reason, the progress of my developing body would have been halted at the first trimester, then nothing would have been lost since ""I"" as a person would never have existed. Then, it wouldn't have mattered much to me if I had been aborted at the first trimester or if I had never been conceived - either way ""I"" would never have come into existence. It comes down to the basic idea that I believe that our mental selves are the very core of what makes us exist as people. Every step (from development of the egg, to fertilization of the egg, to carrying to term of the fetus) that comes before the development of mental existence is an important step for my existence to happen - I cannot have discounted any of the steps as necessary for that potential ""me"". So, this establishes that it is indeed a combination of soul and potential that you most value. I think the thing that is most blocking our mutual understanding are the beliefs that automatically get attached to a belief in the soul. I think that your belief in a soul is the equivalent to my stress of a mental existence. How would you view the situation, I would ask, if you were assured that the soul did not enter until the beginning of the third trimester? In many of our views, the first trimester fetus may have the same potential for becoming a born walking talking person as the third trimester fetus, but the critical difference for me at least is that the thid trimester fetus is already similar enough to us to be called us - a person in the most critical sense. The key ingredient is the beginnings of the mind. Since you view some sense of mind as entering with the soul, you might not think that much happens at the beginning of that third trimester. However, not believing in a soul entering at conception, most of us DO INDEED believe that a very critical thing happens around the beginning of the third trimester - a mental existence begins in the fetus. That is a very important difference in our outlook.","abortion-self-defense","10:32 AM","abortion-debates","165"
