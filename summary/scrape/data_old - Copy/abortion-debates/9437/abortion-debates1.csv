"01-11-2007","9437",1,"None","None","None","Another opinion","246725","In discussions in this forum, I have found that a key differentiator between pro-life and pro-choice proponents is their approach to morality. Pro-life proponents tend to ultimately have a morality based on moral proclamations - religious or otherwise - that cannot be questioned and need no supporting arguement. The proclamation ""All human life is sacred"" is the main one which leads to their pro-life stance. Pro-choice supporters tend not to think in terms of moral proclamations, so proclamations such as ""All human life is sacred"" mean little to them if not more fully supported by rational arguement. What is your general approach to morality and how has that affected your view of abortion rights? --------------- Starting with myself, my general approach to morality is one that tries to ""treat others as I would have myself be treated"" and involves empathizing with others to try to understand where they are coming from. I follow no fixed moral proclamations. I simply think it would be illogical for me to treat others with one set of moral rules but expect myself to be treated with another set of moral rules - moral rules should be universally applied for them to be self-consistent. Where abortion is concerned, ""I' did not start to exist before I did so mentally (which would have been sometime in the third trimester). For me, it would therefore have made no difference if I had been aborted in the first or second trimester or if I had never been conceived - either way, I never would have existed. So, I have no problem in general with abortions in the first and second trimester. However, I would strictly limit third trimester abortions since I can empathize with mentally existing beings and would not want them to be killed without very good reason, as I would not want to be killed without good reason. ----- So, what are your views on this issue or your own moral approaches?","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","10:10 AM","abortion-debates","1"

I really do try to treat others the way I want to be treated. I'm not sure what religion you follow (if any at all), but I am personally Christian, so I try to follow Jesus' teaching. My moral view is sort of expressed in these passages: Matthew 7 Do Not Judge Others Do not judge others, and you will not be judged. 2 For you will be treated as you treat others. The standard you use in judging is the standard by which you will be judged. 3 And why worry about a speck in your friends eye when you have a log in your own? 4 How can you think of saying to your friend, Let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye, when you cant see past the log in your own eye? 5 Hypocrite! First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friends eye. 6 Dont waste what is holy on people who are unholy. Dont throw your pearls to pigs! They will trample the pearls, then turn and attack you. and The Golden Rule 12 Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you. This is the essence of all that is taught in the law and the prophets. These are both from the Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, and that is pretty much what I follow. I also agree with you on abortion: before I existed mentally (around third trimester), I did not exist at all. I also agree that after mental existence comes into play (around third trimester), there must be a really good reason for abortion, such as the woman's life is at risk, or her health is severely threatened.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","10:48 AM","abortion-debates","2"

This is wrong. You yourself find ""mental existence"" to be ""sacred' in a way. There is no rational argument for mental existence being the point of obtaining rights...no matter how hard any of us try You just stated a moral proclamation...(underlined) This, in a way, is another moral proclamation. You feel mental existence is of importance for existing (or being of value). I'm not saying that is wrong or bad (well...I do say that but just not right now ) but it is a moral stance. It logically follows from the moral foundation set up but you made to important claims or ""proclamations"" as you called it. 1) Treat others as you wish to be treated (golden rule) and 2) Mental existence is required to have value My morality was already nicely summed up by you (atleast part of it)","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","11:21 AM","abortion-debates","3"

There is no rational argument for mental existence being the point of obtaining rights...no matter how hard any of us try","Another opinion","246761","I don't find mental existence ""sacred"" - after all, I accept the fact that military action is sometimes necessary where people get killed, I accept people killing when necessary for self-defence, etc. My moral approach comes from the OBSERVATION that when I think of myself, I don't think of my body alone, I think mainly of my mind where I view my body as being, in a sense, owned by my mind. It is my understanding of myself that comes from self-observation, not from a proclamation. The ""treat others as I would have myself be treated"" is a statement but one which has rational reasons behind it and is, therefore, not merely a proclamation. I want to be treated in certain ways because being treated otherwise leads me to suffering, and I don't like to suffer (that is also not a proclamation, just an observation). It is illogical for me to propose a moral code that states that I should be treated one way and all others another way. Sure, I can propose that but it would be ludicrous - why would anyone accept that as a code? I would also laugh at someone who would present to me a moral code where I would treat them better than myself. Moral codes are codes which societies try to follow. Chaos would erupt if there were no moral codes. I choose a code that makes some logical sense by being at least self-consistent so that it has the least chance of being accepted by others as a universal code. The option is chaos, and I personally prefer to avoid chaos.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","12:04 PM","abortion-debates","5"

You have to realize that there is something behind the proclamations of that sort of morality; human life is sacred isn't just a proclamation, it's a philosophy. The case could just as easily be made that pro-choicers are basing their morality on a proclamation as well , that ""reason is the basis for morality"".

If morality is based only on arbitrary proclamations, then there is little chance of consensus because other groups or religions come up with other arbitrary set of rules and we are back to the situation of, in the worst case, chaos and, in the best case, a majority imposing arbitrary rules on an unwilling suffering minority. I suspect that a lot of people, if not most people, at least partially follow some version of ""treat others as you would have yourself be treated"". When, as children, we were scolded ""How would you like it if ..."" that is a tactic of teaching this rule. For those who are religious (which I only marginally, occasionally and hesitatingly am), even Jesus stated ""Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you."" in the Sermon on the Mount talk (as quoted by ShadowPikachu). Many world religions and philosophies seem to incorporate that general rule, which is partly why I think it has a reasonable chance at being incorporated as a global base of morality.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","12:44 PM","abortion-debates","8"

Whether you believe in a god or make yourself god you still are making arbitrary rules for which you develop a morality. The idea that you don't want to suffer and therefore came up with this morality is abritrary as everything we have stated. Why wasn't the conclusion ""I dont' want to suffer so be stronger than everyone else"" or ""I don't want to suffer so don't associate with anyone else"". Or maybe the conslusion could be to believe in a religion. Either way, you are going to have to believe in something and that forms the basis for a morality.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","01:15 PM","abortion-debates","9"

People sometimes to take a disposable view of things that they consider unimportant. To view humanity as sacred helps protect humanity. But I didn't say it was based on proclamations (arbitrary or otherwise); you did--at least one side's. I said it was based on what's behind the proclamation. I think you are getting hung up on the proclamation and not realizing that all the ""proclamation"" does is reflect the moral view behind it. It's no different than your proclamation that morality be based on reason. But pro-lifers often base the pro-life stance on preventing harm. Not just religion. (And in this case they are one-in-the-same anyway.) This isn't a case of harm-preventative-morality versus religious-morality ; it's a case of two harm-preventative moralities in conflict, due to each only focusing mostly on one aspect (either the mother or the unborn baby).","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","01:49 PM","abortion-debates","10"
