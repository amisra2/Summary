"01-12-2007","9437",4,"Another opinion","246910","The unfertilized egg WILL grow into a baby, adolescent, and adult unless something goes wrong and unless it does not also get fertilized. That is also reality. The unfertilized egg needs the following to become a person: 1. fertilization 2. the support of the mother's body to feed it nutrients, etc. for it to grow to the level of having mental existence. 3. Avoidance of potential dangers that stop its growth - natural (that cause many miscarriages or birth defects) or artificial (abortion). The embryo or early fetus needs the same things as the unfertilized egg, except that it has already gone through the fertilization step. It is part way into the process whereas the unfertilized egg may or may not go through that first necessary step. I simply fail to see that step making such a profound difference.","ShadowPikachu","246912","Exactly, it is just a matter of degree, and the degree is not all that large, but I don't think they get that.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","01:30 PM","abortion-debates","47"

But you are sticking to a definition of the golden rule that requires us to be generous. If someone doesn't want to be generous, then the rule of treating others as they would have themselves be treated means that they cannot expect others to be generous to them. Anyway, do you have no empathy toward the employer in that case who would be forced to hire an incompetent because of his need?","jyoshu","246929","But what you don't seem to get is that this will probably happen by default. It's not a matter of 'potential', it WILL happen in most cases unless outside intervention ( killing it ) takes place. That's beyond potential; that's the rule . An unfertilized egg cannot become a person; an embryo more than likely WILL unless something external kills it. You are inaccurately minimizing the difference there, IMO. One will likely ""become a person"", the other will absolutely not. How many people have you ever known that took the philosophy ""I don't want people to be nice to me""? I think you're being unrealistic and grasping at straws here. MOST people want to be treated well. I don't know of anyone who wouldn't prefer people to nice to them or treat them benevolently. Now they may not treat others benevolently, but even among people who don't, I would say most of them would still prefer to be treated benevolently themselves. But maybe I just see society differently than you. Of course! I'm not saying the golden rule SHOULD be followed in every situation; I'm taking issue with you that most people live that way. I think more times than not, the golden rule is not followed, in society (in everyday life) if we are honest with ourselves.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","02:34 PM","abortion-debates","48"
"01-12-2007","9437",4,"Another opinion","246934","I think we simply have a differing understanding of the golden rule. To ""treat others as I would have myself be treated"" requires less of me than ""to treat others as I would WANT to be treated"" since it only requires a moral rule that I would be willing to mutually live with. In other words: I would have myself be treated in the way that I am willing to treat others.","jyoshu","246942","So are you saying there are people out there who would prefer not to treat others well, and therefore expect to not be treated well since they abide by the golden rule? I think the golden rule is meant to presuppose benevolent action. In other words, to 'treat them as you'd have them treat you' is pretty much the same as saying ' how you'd WANT them to treat you' in my opinion. I say this because I've never heard of anyone that would take the ""negative"" version of the golden rule as you seem to be saying. Feel free to correct me if I'm misunderstanding you.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","03:21 PM","abortion-debates","50"

And since I'm sure Steeeeve (the dictionary worshipper) will step in, here is the definition: I also notice you say again here that the unfertlilized egg will absolutely not become a person. May I ask what species would happen to be as you must not be human (who, in the end, do come from these eggs) ? Some extra-terrestrial species that does not use eggs?

"01-12-2007","9437",4,"ShadowPikachu","246903","I didn't say I didn't want to read others opinions, I said I didn't want to argue over my own personal point of view (maybe you should read). Semantics debates get you nowhere, so that is why I said that. Um, I spelled it wrong TWICE. I didn't have time to bother with a spellchecker, I was just typing what formed in my mind. My apoligies to have upset you oh high and mighty one. I've noticed that when you don't have an argument you begin to quibble over some minor misspellings, or some dictionary definition (which you seem to hold as your Bible). Hm, well, sorry, you're stabbing rather wildly, in fact, you ended up stabbing yourself. I happen to be a twenty-year-old in my sophomore year of college at Colorado School of Mines (engineering and science school in case you haven't heard of it). I won't bother to hazard a guess at your age, as guesses base on internet discussion are notoriously inaccurate (as you just proved).","Steeeeve","246946","Yet it wasn't semantics...it was a very good and important point. The point was to show that your idea of when death ends really isn't just ""brain dead"" but rather ""brain dead with no recovery"". The key difference is that if you could recover from no brain then perhaps you wouldn't call this person ""dead"". You failed to address this. I normally could care less how you spell something but if you claim my post is ""retarted"" then it certainly presents irony that has to be pointed out. College student doesn't surprise me much either actually. I wasn't trying to insult as I don't find anything wrong with our younger crowd other than their limited view of the world (Zachvac is pretty good about this though). But since you are in college I suggest taking a logic course (philosophy department normally) as you will understand why the conclusion you come up with does not follow from the premise. Furthermore, as I stated above (and as Phyllis stated), you make a key assumption that is false. Your logic tries to say brain dead therefore dead and then not brain dead therefore not dead. While fine this doesn't exactly say when ""life"" begins is in fact false anyway. The fetus is certainly not dead..wouldn't you agree?","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","03:28 PM","abortion-debates","52"

This means that any moral law you make would have to be applied to everyone - including yourself. I suspect that, when you are thinking of the ""golden rule"", you think more of the one stated by Jesus which is assumed to have a benevolent goal given who it was that stated it. However, as with Kant, there are versions of this law that do not automatically assume that benevolence is necessary. Some degree of benevolence just seems to be automatic, on average, in most societies since most people do seem to be willing to do some giving to others in order to make a society which is nicer to live in.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","03:38 PM","abortion-debates","53"

"01-12-2007","9437",4,"Another opinion","246904","Since you propose no method which can convince anyone else that you are right and they are wrong then your approach to morality leads to nearly arbitrary distributions of morality in the world. There is no reason why someone else of another completely random belief system could not also sit back an claim without proof that ""My morality is right and yours is wrong"". One of my goals in discussing morality is that, if we don't have SOME common moral goals to work off of, then there is no chance whatsoever of reaching some moral consensus, morality is arbitrary, and we risk the moarl chaos that I would think we are trying to avoid. I am not completely following you here, but you seem to claim that my three observations are really proclamations: 1. ""I"" for me means my mental self, with my physical self just tagging along. 2. I do not wish to suffer or to have those I care about suffer. 3. I feel empathy toward others and often feel sorry for the suffering of others. These are observations I made about myself that haven't been taught or randomly reached. Other people might observe other things about themselves (ex. some people seem to get a certain satisfaction out of suffering) so, from that point of view, there is some arbitrariness to my observations of myself since others may not have the same observations about themselves. However, just because others may have other observations about themselves doesn't make my observation a proclamation. As a side note, to be completely accurate about observations 2 and 3, I have to admit that there are rare occasions when I am angry at a loved one and do want them to slightly suffer and there are various people with whom I would find it very difficult to empathize. Moral proclamations tend to run along the line that something ""should"" be a particular way in an absolute way. I am not claiming that there are no valid alternatives to my moral system - there are. I think people should have a right to follow whatever moral system they wish as long as their moral system does not impinge on the rights of others. I am not trying to force my moral system on others. I only try to convince others through force of reason and arguement. Similarly, pro-life proponents do not have the right to force their moral system on me but they are welcome to try to convince me through force of reason and arguement. That reason and arguement leads nowhere if it comes down to a proclamation (such as ""all human life is sacred"") that we don't agree on. Then it is a battle of numbers - i.e. majority wins - and nothing else. That would force the minority to suffer under the repellent system of the majority. That is what I am hoping to avoid in these discussions - I am trying to find a common moral language that we can use to find a compromise.","Steeeeve","246951","So you do not believe in a moral absolute then. This is fine but you must understand that this means you can't criticize other moral belief systems as being wrong. You can't find a compromise when you have a different basis for morality. This ""proclamation"" of all human life being sacred is not one that just came out of thin air but rather the morality system set into place. Your morality system, which is no provable than mine, says that the proclamation that came out of mine is just not true to your own morals. There really can't be a common language when you come from two directions and get two different answers. The only way to convince the other would be to show the others moral system is wrong. With a relative approach to morals you really can't say my system is wrong....so that's out.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","03:41 PM","abortion-debates","55"

If you want to hold onto your belief system, that is fine with me. The only problem arises when one group tries to impose their belief system on another group. I will fight hard against the religious right imposing its morality on me as I am sure you would fight hard against any moral system you are against being imposed on you. If faced with the option of your moral system vs my moral system, I will certainly vote for my moral system since I consider the state's forced imposition of my moral system on you and others as less of an evil than the state's imposition of your moral system on me and others. However, my hope is that there might be more peaceful means of at least partly resolving this conflict through discussion and compromise. In discussion, we need to try to convince the other side by presenting reason and arguement while listening to and aknowledging the reason and arguements of the other side. Perhaps there is ultimately no room for compromise and our mutual assumptions are so diametrically opposed that any movement is impossible. However, where the abortion debate is concerned, I don't think that our two sides have tried hard enough. Anyway, even if a compromise is never reached, I think such discussions are useful if only to expose the fact that neither side is composed of monsters but of people with approaches that just happen to be quite different.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","04:05 PM","abortion-debates","59"
