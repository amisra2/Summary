"01-11-2007","9437",3,"Phyllis","246810","There is not a 100% guarantee. But a large percentage do. Enough of a percentage to make a moral difference. For example, a fetus has developed into a baby over 6 billion times in the last one-hundred years or so. I don't think that my overall point can be pooh-poohed by simply saying there is no guarantee that a fetus will develop into a baby. And I am suggesting that the definition of ""death"" would be different in Brainiac's case. Essentially, I am stating an assumed (but necessary) premise in your conclusion. You say that the end of mental activity is the definition of death. But it really should be more like the following: the end of mental activity with a low probability of recovery. This was what I was trying to point out. Intuitively, we would think very differently about someone being removed from life support who we knew had a good chance of recovering from brain-death than we would someone in the same scenario who we knew had no chance of recovering. Thus, my suggestion that your conclusion has a hidden, but very necessary premise: the premise that the patient will not recover. This is a very different justification for abortion. In the first scenario, I think it was being suggested that the embryo could ethically be killed simply because it did not have a mental existence. I.e., the embryo has no ethical value whatsoever. In this scenario, however, it is being suggested that whatever value the embryo has, a woman possesses the right to her own body. That is a very different claim, and does not erase the ethical concerns with respect to the embryo. It is akin to a caretaker that says, ""though Braniac has an outstanding chance to recover, it would cost way to much to see him through his recovery. Therefore, we shall pull the plug."" And besides that, the idea of ""potentiality"" applies also to third trimester pregnancies. The fetus, though now in possession of mental existence, is still only potentially a born baby. But you, as I understand it, do want the woman's choice taken away at the third trimester (with some rare exceptions, I believe).","ShadowPikachu","246831","I'm really not in the mood to argue with you on this. I stated my position, and what I beleive to be the most logical point of view, if you don't like it, I don't really care. You are correct in that a woman posesses the right to her own body. I did not say that the foetus had NO moral value, just that its value is so miniscule - the value that it has is it might maybe be a potential human some day, that a woman should not be denied the right to abort based on that. The potentiality applies to around after the beginning of hte third trimester when the foetus has mental consciousness. Yes, I do beleive abortion should not be allowed after that as the foetus has become an unborn baby with human consciousness, and therefore has equal moral value as the woman. I do, however, support late term abortions in cases where a woman's life is at risk, or her health will be severely affected, as in those cases, I beleive that the woman should not be forced to go through with it if it will harm her.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","05:36 PM","abortion-debates","31"
"01-12-2007","9437",3,"Another opinion","246825","Many of us view humanity with mental existence as important. The only ones you are protecting that our view does not are those human living entities with no mental existence. How can you even talk about ""harm"" to a living entity with no mental existence? The golden rule is not just one sided. It does not expect us to do all giving and no taking. I have expectations of how others should treat me (the taking part) but, to be consistent, I should realize that they have expectations of me (the giving part). Though people may want to win out in a job interview over someone more qualified, most don't morally expect that that should happen since they realize that that expectation would not be fair. They may make a buck off of a person but, unless they are con artists who lie to get that buck, most will do it in a way they consider fair, under laws they themselves would be willing to live under. What you are talking about here is the *potential* to exist being important. I would personally also thinking that potential existence is important, but not nearly as important as an existing person. After all, unfertilized eggs and sperm also have the *potential* to become full people but no one is concerned about their loss. For many of us it is the actual mentally-existing person that is most important. However, if there is a contest between the rights of a living, existing person and the rights of either *potential* person, then I think the rights of the living person win out.","jyoshu","246869","Well, to say it has no mental existence doesn't really tell the whole story. The fetus WILL have (more than likely) full mental existence in a very short time. It seems to me that if you ""view humanity with mental existance as important"" you'd also view as important that the unborn baby WILL indeed reach that point, in all likelihood. Upon reviewing the golden rule ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you"" I see nothing of any other 'side.' It's very clear--treat others the way you'd want to be treated. No one wants to be treated badly, so if you follow the golden rule, you'll be benevolent. That's a nice silver-lining take on the situation, but you and I both know that there are times someone who has a greater and more pressing need for the job (even to feed his family) gets put aside for someone who doesn't need it as badly. The issue here isn't ""fairness."" This issue is doing unto others as you'd have them do unto you. If you're going to hold the golden rule up as a rule, you have to be consistent. Why not? Why shouldn't they be given at least closer to equal weight? The baby is going to be as real and genuine of a person as the mother; the only difference is that the baby is a few years behind. You're talking about a difference of time. An unfertilized egg or sperm alone will not grow up into a person. So it does NOT have that potential at all. That's fair enough, but I just think it's important to at least acknowledge and realize that the unborn baby does have worth and importance, and not just a piece of tissue as it's so often callously viewed.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","09:18 AM","abortion-debates","32"
"01-12-2007","9437",3,"Another opinion","246826","But you are missing the point. It is morality based on arbitrary proclamations such as that one which is what I am arguing against. I strongly believe that we have to try our hardest to incorporate reason in our sense of morality for it to not be arbitrary and to reduce human suffering. Though there are many religious proclamations that have reduced human suffering, others have made it worse (as in the proclamation against gays or Islam's proclamations of the inferiority of all women).","jyoshu","246871","It is not based on a ""proclamation."" It is based on a view and philosophy. The proclamation simply reflects the view. Again, I think you are getting hung up on the statement rather than what's behind it. Well of course, but religion often does this. When religious people act out of compassion, do you not realize they often view it as the rational thing to do as well? The thing I think is critical is that we incorporate compassion into our reason . One thing I find fascinating is how there are some people here that seem to think reason alone is the path to reduce human suffering. I see no reason to think that. 'Reason' itself is arbitrary to some extent--a lot of people in history have done some very nasty things in following 'reason'. Compassion is a much better guide, IMO, and those two do NOT necessarily go hand-in-hand. It CAN go hand-in-hand, but it's not a given, IMO. Because of that, the idea of morality based solely on reason is a pretty scary prospect, to me anyway. Given how many times humanity has failed in trying to apply 'reason' as the standard for morality, and given how arbitrary reason is from person to person, it amazes me that anyone would still hold reason alone up as some ideal standard. I don't know about Islam, but in the case of Christianity, those were cases where there was a departure from real Christianity.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","09:31 AM","abortion-debates","33"

Religious moral teaching in many cases does follow goals of compassion but too often, they are not followed rationally or they are ignored. Homosexuals are treated badly by religion and showed little if no compassion. Many religious groups think and revel in the thought that those who do not believe their religion will go to hell - not a compassionate stance at all. You may claim that this does not show the TRUE religion but what do you call the TRUE religion if this is how it is practiced. Religions are judged by the beliefs of their adherents, not by how they hypothetically could be.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","11:11 AM","abortion-debates","36"

"01-12-2007","9437",3,"Another opinion","246820","My stance on morality is based on the following observations: 1. ""I"" for me means my mental self, with my physical self just tagging along. 2. I do not wish to suffer or to have those I care about suffer. 3. I feel empathy toward others and often feel sorry for the suffering of others. Those are observations, not proclamations. The way I choose a moral code to avoid the problem of suffering is to essentially make a theoretical deal with others to have a mutual moral code that we will all treat each other as we ourselves would be treated - in this way, all of us can win out and I solve my problem of points 2 and 3. Perhaps there are other better ways of finding a solution for societies to avoid suffering, but I haven't heard of one. I did not choose this solution arbitrarily. I chose it since it makes sense and should theoretically work and since many, if not most people, at least make some effort at using that moral code anyway so this moral code is at least partially universally adopted. It is the best moral option I have ever heard to address my concern about suffering. What is arbitrary about the reasoning I presented above? What unsupported proclamations do you claim that I have made? Either way, are you proposing that all moral systems are equally arbitrary and therefore equally valid? In your scenario, someone could come up with an arbitrary proclamation ""black people should be slaves to white people"" and build a morality based on that. My moral approach questions that proclamation as well and thus avoids un-necessary human suffering.","Steeeeve","246894","First off, all equally arbitrary doesn't mean they are all valid. If I made a mistake let me clear that up now Secondly, you still have an arbitrary system going there. The idea that many people believe something doesn't make it true. Furthermore, your observations still make several assumptions that in fact are proclamations. Obviously people have come to observe different things from you...all of which can't be proven (in the sense we mean it) and all of which are abitrary.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","12:19 PM","abortion-debates","38"
"01-12-2007","9437",3,"ShadowPikachu","246828","That's the most retarted thing I've ever heard. But then again, you aren't one for logic, especially when you bring this ridiculous ""quasianalogy"" into the discussion. What I am saying makes a hell of a lot more logical sense than your ""analogy. Mine actually has logic in it: If a person's mental existence ends (brain death - defined my the medical field) they are considered dead. It is logical that if mental existence begins (start of brain activity and consciousness) they are now alive. And again, I wouldn't expect you to understand logic if it hit you in the face.","Steeeeve","246895","Other than you spelling ""retarded"" wrong for the third or fourth time in a row... like the logic of the ending point having to be the opposite of the beginning point? I'm going to take a stab here and say you are probably in the 8 or 9th grade (not that this is a bad thing) because anyone who has taken a day of a logic class would understand how your statement makes no sense. If you finish at the finish line does that mean you start at the same line? In your world it always does...","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","12:28 PM","abortion-debates","39"
"01-12-2007","9437",3,"Another opinion","246881","I personally do place some importance in the embryo's POTENTIAL to become a person. However, I place the rights of a REAL person far above the hypothetical rights of a POTENTIAL person since what IS is more important than what MIGHT BE. Who ever said that the need for a job is what determines the best candidate?","jyoshu","246901","Well, it's more than 'potential'; it WILL grow into a baby, adolescent, and adult by default unless something goes wrong such as a miscarriage or abortion. That's not just potential, it's reality. Well that's just it .... it doesn't. But that only further exemplifies that we don't use the golden rule in such cases. There are many such cases in life and I think we probably use it a lot less than a lot of people think.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","12:41 PM","abortion-debates","42"
