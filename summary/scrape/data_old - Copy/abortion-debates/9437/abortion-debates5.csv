Once again you have not stated your actual opinion, just attacked others.","Steeeeve","246976","Well I disagree with that. You also keep changing the subject. The question was regarding the logic behind the point of death and whether or not that can determine the point of life. Can you present some form of logic that suggests this is true or not? As for my opinion on morality...there is an absolute right and wrong. Happy?","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","05:01 PM","abortion-debates","63"
"01-12-2007","9437",5,"Another opinion","246956","I am not criticizing other belief systems for being wrong. If you want to hold onto your belief system, that is fine with me. The only problem arises when one group tries to impose their belief system on another group. I will fight hard against the religious right imposing its morality on me as I am sure you would fight hard against any moral system you are against being imposed on you. If faced with the option of your moral system vs my moral system, I will certainly vote for my moral system since I consider the state's forced imposition of my moral system on you and others as less of an evil than the state's imposition of your moral system on me and others. However, my hope is that there might be more peaceful means of at least partly resolving this conflict through discussion and compromise. In discussion, we need to try to convince the other side by presenting reason and arguement while listening to and aknowledging the reason and arguements of the other side. Perhaps there is ultimately no room for compromise and our mutual assumptions are so diametrically opposed that any movement is impossible. However, where the abortion debate is concerned, I don't think that our two sides have tried hard enough.","Steeeeve","246978","This is why we have a democracy. Someones morals has to win I don't question that you want yours to be the victor haha. The only way this is happening is a realization of morals among pro-life or pro-choice side. I feel that many people don't understand their own moral system and how they actually feel. I also think someones moral code is often different from a natural tendency. For example, I feel most people are probably naturally selfish but we enact a moral code to try and reduce this. [quotw]Anyway, even if a compromise is never reached, I think such discussions are useful if only to expose the fact that neither side is composed of monsters but of people with approaches that just happen to be quite different.[/QUOTE]haha, yet both sides have their monsters.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","05:07 PM","abortion-debates","64"
"01-12-2007","9437",5,"jyoshu","246963","Yes, I do view the golden rule in the sense that Christ meant it. Let me say then that my view is that an assumed benevolent goal is the golden rule I think is the more rational view. Given that, I still feel that a rational morality is one that needs to be tempered and checked and accompanied by compassion. Sorry I didn't realize we were talking about two different things.","Another opinion","246979","I agree that adding compassion as well as reason to morality is a good approach. I just don't know how easy that would be to universally adopt. I think by our very biological natures, there seems to be some level of compassion ""built in"". Even apes have been shown to show compassion to other apes in certain situations. (This arguement assumes you agree with evolution and that this shows some biological basis to compassion). However, greed and selfishness are unfortunately also strong driving forces that often win out. In moral discussions, an appeal to compassion wins out for those who are predisposed to that anyway but I suspect that it falls on deaf ears for those for whom compassion takes a definite backseat to selfishness. However, the golden rule in the form of ""How would you like it if you were treated that way"" often does work to convince a much wider range of people to act in ways that ultimately show more compassion. It is a moral approach that far more people seem to accept and follow, so far more people can be swayed by its arguements. In a way, it is partly a selfish approach because many will agree to treat others fairly only so that they themselves are treated fairly. However, though it might ultimately have selfish motivations, it has a better chance of reaching the ultimate goal of a more peaceful and compassionate society. Perhaps we should not be referring to it as the ""golden rule"" since that might imply the automatically benevolent Jesus version, but I don't have a better name for it except for possibly refering to Kant's Categorical Imperative instead.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","05:15 PM","abortion-debates","65"
"01-13-2007","9437",5,"Steeeeve","246762","This assumes brain-dead is a logical choice to consider one dead. Even so, it proves nothing about when life begins. What says they have to be the same? This is a classic example of a conclusion not following from the premise.","Shooterandproud","247046","Not necessarily. When ""life"" begins is irrelevant, because flowers and weeds don't have rights yet they are a life form. The thing that determines rights is intelligence. Not how much or how little, but whether someone has it at all. A spec of dirt has no intelligence. It won't pop up and say ""hey! How ya doin!"" unless you're on crack. We've actually killed intelligent entities for less than the consequences of carrying out an unwanted pregnancy. We hunt, and we go to war. Even though I do not agree with war, I do agree with hunting, and I myself hunt on occasion. However, that is off topic. The point is, carrying out an unwanted pregnancy can have devastating effects, and those next 18 years could hold her back from her life. Its awful how she will have to liver her life. If she gets an abortion, the embryo does not (to quote another opinion) ""mentally exist"". Now, hunting is really only done for recreation, and maybe a good meal. They would've been almost just as well off if they went to the local taco bell. Sure, they'd prefer hunting, but its really only done for fun and exercise. I, myself, value an animal over an embryo at its current stage. The only reason I don't completely think an animal is worth more is because that embryo has a chance of becoming a human. Then again, the animal does mentally exist and has full awareness, and the embryo is really just a sitting cellular watersack with no organs.","approach-morality-determines-view-abortion","12:36 PM","abortion-debates","68"
