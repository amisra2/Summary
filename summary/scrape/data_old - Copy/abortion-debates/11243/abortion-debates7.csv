If the term ""no law"" has no meaning then do you believe the people that wrote it had no idea what they were writing? Secondly, how can you be so ""matter of fact"" about certain issues in the constitution when you yourself admit that the provisions could mean anything because they have no set meaning. For all you know abortion is no longer a constitution right and slavery is a-ok. Your theory is unworkable and to be frank, stupid.","chester","312552","I have answered quite enough questions. Now it is the time for those who, while providing no definitions of the terms used in the Constitution, declare mine wrong. So far, I'm pitching a no hitter.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","10:11 AM","abortion-debates","91"

If the 14th amendment was intended by its author to incorporate the bill of rights and apply earlier amendments to the states, then the 14th amendment went beyond merely guaranteeing those rights that were being denied on the basis of race, to protect, for example, the first amendment rights of freedom of the press and of religion. John Bingham's arguments suggest that the 14th amendment was intended, broadly, to protect all persons from the denial by the states of rights protected under the Bill of Rights. And indeed, proposed language that specifically named race, introduced by Thaddeus Stevens, was removed from the final version of the 14th amendment. So while it's clear to me that the framers of the 14th amendment were primarily concerned with preventing the states from denying rights on the basis of race, it's not clear that they were exclusively intending this. And of course, whatever the specific intent of the framers of the 14th amendment, the Supreme Court has over time interpreted the amendment as protecting the rights of all persons, and not merely to preventing race discrimination. The Supreme Court has ruled that the 14th amendment protects the rights of gay people. from another poster on another forum expresses the essence of my point. All the words of the Constitution are subject to judicial interpretation, and that interpretation must, as always, begin with the words. Where it begins is, of course, not where it ends.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","10:35 AM","abortion-debates","92"

A tyranny against individual liberties is still a tyranny, whether it is passed by a majority or not. You have always argued in favour of mob rule, but that always leads to the lynch mob. Pity you don't recognise that.","Steeeeve","312589","I'm asking for historical evidence of the original meaning of the document. Can you provide proof for your claim or not? Well, they've historically done it, and rightly so. The Constitution is not the final word on what constitutes a basic right, and was never intended to be, as the amendments in the Bill of Rights make clear.[/quote]This is not clear and if what you say is true then surely you can come up with historical evidence to show this is correct. Your claim is that the constitution isn't the final word but rather the judge is. This is ridiculous to say the least. Whether you favor the way our system of government is set up or not doesn't remove the way it is setup. If an amendment passes by the people then that is the top law....tyranny or not. No historical document shows that the judge should be the ultimate decider of issues and whether or not they are good. I support democracy and you support a monarchy.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","05:13 PM","abortion-debates","93"

You haven't answered any questions of mine and frankly you are the one now avoiding to answer a question (something you claimed someone else was doing earlier).
