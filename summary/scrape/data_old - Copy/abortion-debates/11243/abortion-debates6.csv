Care to define ""compelled"" is such a way that has been true ever since 1791? I prefer to live in the 21st Century, thank you. BTW, you disapprove of slavery in all but one case, don't you? You would keep a pregnant woman in slavery to her fetus. And here I thought you were the ""originalist"" on the forum. Care to reread Amendment 13? Your attempted analysis would keep the Constitution, like a beetle preserved in amber, a museum piece.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","02:08 PM","abortion-debates","76"

If their meaning is so obvious, only an intellectually dishonest person would not try to give their one size fits all definition. Then again, you are adept at Jesuitical word games. Let's try something that should be easy for even one as intellectually lacking as you. Please define the term no law . If even that proves too difficult, how about NO or LAW as used in the First Amendment?","why-dont-they-put-ballot","03:42 PM","abortion-debates","78"
"06-02-2008","11243",6,"chester","312417","Which is just as it should be and just as the Framers intended it to be. Speaking of the 8th Amendment, when it was written, branding and lopping off an ear were common punishments for crimes. Are we to be bound by that, or do you think Mr. Justice Lewis Powell was correct when he wrote about ""evolving standards of decency.""? Would you really want to be bound by what the 18th Century thought constituted ""cruel and unusual punishment""?","Steeeeve","312446","Really? Can you back up that the judges should have more power than the people? This contradicts a direct statement from the federalist papers which said the judiciary is by far the weakest branch. I get the feeling you don't really care about the truth of what the Framers ""intended"". Furthermore, I'm not sure how it matters to someone who believes their words don't matter anyway. Yes, we are bound to that. How can can a judge say how we evolved and where does it give him or her the authority to make such a decision. The meaning of the 8th amendment is what it was when adopted. To do otherwise means you make up meaning at the standard of the opinion of 9 people. no, which is why we pass laws to change what punishments exist.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","05:28 PM","abortion-debates","79"

If the term ""no law"" has no meaning then do you believe the people that wrote it had no idea what they were writing? Secondly, how can you be so ""matter of fact"" about certain issues in the constitution when you yourself admit that the provisions could mean anything because they have no set meaning. For all you know abortion is no longer a constitution right and slavery is a-ok. Your theory is unworkable and to be frank, stupid.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","05:30 PM","abortion-debates","80"
"06-02-2008","11243",6,"Phyllis","312450","You are right; I do not posses the intellectual fortitude to hold to the principle that the only fixed meaning to the Constitution is that there is no fixed meaning to the Constitution. Regardless, I have already indulged your "" NO LAW "" ""argument"" (which is really nothing more than a nonsensical nuisance). And we ended up with you saying, on the one hand, that you read the Constitution in its "" widest possible interpretation ,"" but on the other hand saying that traffic tickets and school suspensions could not constitute ""cruel and unusual"" punishment (thus not reading the Constitution in its widest possible interpretation). Thus we concluded this line of argument with the simple obvious fact that you read the Constitution in its widest possible interpretation, except when you don't.","chester","312456","Translation: I won't commit to a definition because then the entire forum will see that my argument is ludicrous. I would rather attack you than make a substantive statement. Are you sure you don't take lessons from another obfuscater here? Are you sure you're NOT that other obfuscater? Can you define Doppelganger? Do you not know that a traffic ticket is merely an accusation? There's no punishment until after conviction. Why do you persist in upholding the slavery of a woman to her fetus? Have you not read Amendment 13?","why-dont-they-put-ballot","07:29 PM","abortion-debates","82"
"06-02-2008","11243",6,"Phyllis","312457","If I knew the definition, I would commit to it. But that I personally do not know the definition does not advance your argument, which is that there is no definition. I think that is pretty clear.","chester","312459","That's simply intellectual bankruptcy. You don't know the definition of the words of the Constitution, but you know mine are wrong. BTW, silly one, you can search every post of mine and nowhere will you find a single one which says that those words have NO definition. All that I have maintained, and all that I continue to maintain, is that the definition of words changes over time, and that the SCOTUS must deal not only with the 18th Century meaning but also with contemporary ones. BTW, a fetus is nothing more than a parasite living off its host. Removing it is no more of a moral issue than removing a hangnail.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","09:20 PM","abortion-debates","84"

So I assume you have a definition for every word in the constitution? Afterall, this is what you claim Phyllis needs to have. The entire living constitution implies no meaning in the words of the constitution. It instead uses the idea that whatever the judge says is what the words mean at that given point in time. You render the document useless and without meaning thus making the words in the document have no meaning. Life phyllis said, there is no way your ""theory"" of interpretation could, without a doubt, say a speeding ticket is not cruel and unusual punishment. Parasite implies different species...but why bother with facts right?","why-dont-they-put-ballot","09:43 PM","abortion-debates","85"
"06-04-2008","11243",6,"Steeeeve","312408","I'd say you are right up until saying it can be decided based on ""court decision"". On what basis does the judge decide if the constitution is ""silent"" on the issue?(assuming no other law exists). If it is so broad why do you feel there are so many specific constitutional rights? You are still a liar I see.","lesz","312541","Courts are just one of the bodies who make such decisions. Of course, those decisions aren't final. Ultimately, they can be reversed by legislatures amending the Constitution. I certainly wouldn't trust legislators dependent on the electoral whim of the mob to make objective judgements here. I guess the founders decided some minimally basic rights needed to be spelled out. That didn't mean rights that didn't make it into the Constitution explicitly aren't rights defensible under the Constitution, as the IXth amendment makes clear. This is a matter for interpretation. If one accepts that the right to choose whether to continue one's pregnancy, or the right to marry the spouse of one's choice, is a basic right, then the Constitution has to protect individuals seeking to exercise such rights against a tyrannical government. There is no other sensible choice. That, buddy, is constructionist. Well, I never called you a gentleman or an intellectual. I express opinions. You resort to schoolhouse trash talk.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","06:07 AM","abortion-debates","87"
"06-04-2008","11243",6,"Phyllis","312426","Where you will get disagreement, however, is with the claim that judges may appropriately update, change, etc. the Constitution. Indeed it is clear that the founders wanted a Constitution that could be changed (that was, after all, a flaw of the Articles of Confederation); but they were absolutely clear about how any changes would be made: not by judges, but by the process established in Article V. You pick an interesting example of how the Constitution ""evolved"": slavery. This is interesting because abolishing slavery did not happen as a result of judges' interpretation of Constitutional text, but rather by democratic adoption of a new amendment. Even more interesting, the foothold of slavery was actually exacerbated by the Supreme Court in Dred Scott v. Sanford. This isn't exactly correct. From the ratification of the Constitution, Abortion had always been prohibited after ""quickening"" by the common law. Statutes started to emerge after advances in science led to an increased amount of knowledge regarding the formation of the human being. The result of such knowledge led virtually every existing state to ban abortions before quickening.","lesz","312543","Thank you for your welcome back. As I didn't make precisely this claim, the disagreement doesn't apply to me. I said judges interpreted how far to apply the Constitution, for example, in deciding whether something is a basic right (or not) that is protected against attempts by government to take it away. Sometimes, extremely rarely, judges are ahead of legislative or public opinion, for example, as with Loving v. Virginia, or Griswold v. Connecticut, decisions I have no quarrel with. Usually, they tend to track it more closely, as with Roe v. Wade, where public opinion hasn't shifted much over a generation or two, and was in favour of reducing restrictions in order to save women's lives, and put reproductive decisions more firmly in women's hands. However, never do judges get the final say. Ultimately, that always rests with legislatures, though they have to find supermajorities or jump through various hoops to override judges by constitutional amendments. Of course, and no judicial decision has ever changed the letter of any Constitution, except, I suppose, where such a decision throws out some amendment to a state constitution, as in the case of Romer v. Evans in Colorado. No judge, however, could reject an amendment to the US Constitution. (I would even respectfully suggest that whenever there is a concerted effort to deny rights to people who claim them as basic, then that denial is what needs to be placed into the Constitution, so there can be no argument about it. Courts and judges, being human, will always err, but I'd prefer they err on the side of individual rights, rather than the side of government authoritarianism.) And I would reply that there is more than one way to skin a cat. I agree that judges very rarely get ahead of public or legislative opinion, but I do not think it is some sort of catastrophe when they occasionally do. Governments (including legislatures) are rarely keen to recognise the rights of individuals or limits to their own authority, after all, and the courts are a principal defence against tyranny, especially for voting minorities. In any case, the judicial decision is never final under the US system, it can be reversed (in effect) if enough legislators think it is a bad one. Right, but it wasn't until the 19th century that blanket restrictions started to be passed. Current law is generally in accord with the modern scientific consensus, where abortion is available on demand in the first trimester (before there is a brain with any significant functionality), considerably more restricted in the second (where ambiguity about the functionality of the brain exists), and very difficult to obtain in the third (where there is a chance of foetal survival outside the womb). I'm fairly comfortable with where abortion law stands now, and would neither restrict it further nor expand it. Of course, scientific advances might cause me to change that opinion, but arguments from religious morality are not very likely to.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","06:30 AM","abortion-debates","88"

Can you provide historical evidence to show that this is the role of a judge. Yet you gave very specific rights the constitution included (some not listed)...so I guess it is not broad after all? Ok, there was zero historical evidence to suggest it was a right at the time of adoption so what evidence do you have that shows a judge can change the people's will of an amendment or provision(s) they passed? You are a liar which is why I called you that. You make claims about me that are false even after I repeatedly tell you otherwise.

Well, they've historically done it, and rightly so. The Constitution is not the final word on what constitutes a basic right, and was never intended to be, as the amendments in the Bill of Rights make clear. A tyranny against individual liberties is still a tyranny, whether it is passed by a majority or not. You have always argued in favour of mob rule, but that always leads to the lynch mob. Pity you don't recognise that. As I said, I never called you a gentleman, and I certainly do not expect you ever to behave like one. You are no constructionist on constitutional issues, and that's no lie.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","06:46 AM","abortion-debates","90"
