"05-28-2008","11243",4,"chester","312104","Steeve, When it comes to the freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment and incorporated against state action through the 14, these magnificent words from Mr Justice Robert Jackson in Barnette work for me: If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein. If there are any circumstances which permit an exception, they do not now occur to us. 19 We think the action of the local authorities in compelling the flag salute and pledge transcends constitutional limitations on their power and invades the sphere of intellect and spirit which it is the purpose of the First Amendment to our Constitution to reserve from all official control. Let's never forget that Jackson was the USA's chief prosecutor at Nurnberg, so, based on his experiences, I give his opinion great weight. In general, the Constitution mandates that an individual's freedom extends as far as possible until and unless it infringes on another's. And that, Phyllis, is why I oppose restriction's on an individual's right to possess porn. She or he is not infringing on anyone else's rights. This sums up quite well why ""Originalism"" is a sham: In his Doors of Perception Aldous Huxley proposes that our capacity to reason and even our senses are governed by mental patterns, perceptual sets, that determine the limits of what the mind can conceive. The mind uses a taxonomy--a set of categories--into which it squashes the somewhat messier occurences of life, that not only shapes what we think but what we can think. Everywhere, polar categories such as liberal and conservative, cosmopolitan and provincial, A-Type and B-Type, believer and secularist constrain both the public conversation and the interior monologue. And to have different categories, or different categories of categories, would make of us a different people.","Steeeeve","312112","And this, yet again, doesn't address anything I said. Who cares what Jackson said in Barnette when aren't discussing that? Not it doesn't. There is no evidence from what was written to suggest this. Furthermore, by stating the Constitution ""mandates"" something is to imply a meaning in the constitution. This directly contradicts your ""living constitution"" theory which states the meaning is what a judge says it is. So basically it only mandates what you say if 5 people on the current Supreme Court say it does. This is not only an unworkable use of the constitution but, to be frank, idiotic. And yet this ideal is no where in any constitution of the United States nor the writings of those who wrote it. Basically you have taken the entire constitution and implied that what they were getting at is we should promote freedom to the point where it doesn't hurt someone else (whatever that mean) and simply choose to ignore what is actually written. This is nothing less than rendering the Constitution a useless piece of paper. It seems to me the biggest sham shown so far is your ability to form an argument. Why don't you address my points and write your own words? Why can't you state a criteria for interpreting the constitution?","why-dont-they-put-ballot","09:50 PM","abortion-debates","47"

The Constitution is a living document that must never be straitjacketed into a fixed interpretation. It must constantly be reinterpreted in the light of changing times, conditions, and values. Those things, not some dead formalism, are what judges must use in Constitutional interpretation. Mr. Justice Lewis Powell put it well when he talked about ""evolving standards of decency.""","why-dont-they-put-ballot","07:47 AM","abortion-debates","48"

By saying that the Constitution must never be straightjacketed into a fixed interpretation, you are, in fact, straightjacketing the Constitution into a fixed interpretation. But under your philosophy, one day the court might say that, because there is no fixed meaning to the Constitution (that is, except for the fixed meaning that there is no fixed meaning), and because it must constantly be reinterpreted in the light of changing times, conditions, and values, a law prohibiting you from typing on this forum does not violate the First Amendment because the times, conditions, and values of society have sufficiently changed.

"05-29-2008","11243",4,"Steeeeve","312174","Should we listen to other countries and see what they did? Should it be the opinion of the judge?","chester","312177","Yes and yes in part! Why is that a problem for you? That's the very function of the judiciary under Article 3 of the Constitution. The very reasons why unelected judges are appointed for life are to remove them from the hurly-burly of electoral politics and allow them to exercise their considered judgment about what the Constitution means. Should the public disagree, as it did with Dred Scott, they may either wage war or amend the Constitution (as the 21st repealed the 18th) and correct things as they see fit. In any case, to imprison the minds of 21st Century justices in the prison of the ""original"" (whatever that means) meanings of the words of an 18th Century document is a fool's errand In the interim, I'll stand with Marshall and Powell. Like it or not, it really DOES depend on what the meaning of ""is"" is.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","06:04 PM","abortion-debates","52"

Instead of having the vast majority of Americans make decisions, you choose to have 9 lawyers from Ive League schools make the decisions. This is crazy. You aren't arguing for this though. By telling them to decide what laws are good based on nothing you make them political and give them the most power...both of these are contrary to what is supposed to happen. You know, it isn't even hard to see that the judiciary has become more political. This is a direct result of people realizing that you can get what you want via the judiciary branch thus making them a political body. Perhaps one day you get 5 people on there making decisions you don't like and then what could you say? This is the way it is supposed to be? Finally, you have shown nothing from the founders to suggest they wanted a ""living constitutional"" view. In fact, this didn't even happen for over 120 years!! They were all thought to be ""originalist"" which at the time was called being a judge. These are easier than you think and even if hard those words still had meaning when adopted. Are you really arguing that when ""due process"" was added to the 5th amendment that they really had no idea what it meant? This is absurd.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","09:44 PM","abortion-debates","57"

I notice that you have not even tried. Why not attempt either the definition you think the authors had in mind when they wrote those words OR what you think they might mean today?

I want you to tell me if they had a meaning behind words like ""no law"" (which really should be used in context of the entire amendment). I'm not saying it is going to be 100% perfect in figuring out whether a law meets the adopted meaning of a constitutional provision but I am saying it is better to have a standard to look at then to say ""well, since we don't know what it means so we will just make something up"". Judge Bork said this about the ninth amendment (at the time): ""...if you had an amend#ment that says Congress shall make no and then there is an ink blot and you cannot read the rest of it and that is the only copy you have I do not think the court can make up what might be under the ink blot if you cannot read it."" You propose this is wrong and we do make up the meaning. I don't see how this is anything short of giving judges the most power in our government and rendering the constitution useless.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","07:05 AM","abortion-debates","59"

Glad we agree that the Constitution is what the judges say it is. Glad that we agree that it is the proper role of the judiciary to interpret the words of the Constitution. I knew you would see the light, even if you would prefer to leave the definition of such a simple term as ""NO LAW"" to the judges.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","11:44 AM","abortion-debates","60"
