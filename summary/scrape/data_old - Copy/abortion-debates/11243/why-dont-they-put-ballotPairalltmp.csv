However, the founders also had the wisdom to recognise that values and culture change, and they did not mean for future generations to be tightly bound by their own slave-owning culture where women were second class citizens. The ambit of rights was never specified absolutely in the Constitution, and has evolved considerably over time. We consider things to be rights today that the founders did not. The right to choose to carry a pregnancy to term or not is one of them the founders didn't consider. When you consider that the US and state governments, in common with European governments, did not start banning all abortions till (if I recall) the 19th century, it suggests that government at the time read into the Constitution an authority to control the lives of women it did not, in fact, possess, or at least that had not been explicitly granted by the Constitution. The founders were silent on the matter. That we recognise the limitations to government authority in this sphere today is testimony to our growth as a culture away from the imposition by government of religious dogma.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","abortion-debates","65","06:53 AM"

The founders never thought that a few unelected officials from Ivy League schools should decide how the constitution should change and you can't show one historical founding document to show this isn't true. The constitution changes and our society changes by voting and changing the laws.

However, unless the Constitution specifies how far it may be applied, then it is perfectly valid to interpret how far to apply it, and courts and legislatures are the institutions that do this. There is plenty of wiggle room in the Constitution where interpretation of its application is concerned, and it's foolish in the extreme to pretend otherwise. If the Constitution were as simple to interpret and apply as you like to pretend, Steve, the courts would be out of business. Thus, for example, once basic rights such as the right to marry the spouse of one's choice, or the right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy, are recognised by a significant public consensus, then the courts act perfectly constitutionally in extending constitutional protections to individuals targeted by a tyrannical government that seeks to impose narrow religious prejudices on people who do not share them.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","abortion-debates","70","07:53 AM"
"","06-02-2008","11243","lesz","312405","Well, the Constitution defines the overall relationship between government and the governed, and between various branches of government. This is simply spelled out, and there isn't much room for legal manoeuvers. Where it's more open to interpretation is in deciding what basic rights are protected by it, and the degree to which it limits government powers over individuals. Government has the power to punish murderers, for example, but it is not so obvious that it can arbitrarily decree that abortion is murder, because there is no consensus over whether a foetus is a victim in the legal sense. Now, you could write that into the Constitution, as some are trying, but that document is silent on the issue of what a human person actually is -- and as we all know, the society that produced it didn't regard slaves or women as full persons in their own right, neither did it extend full rights to everyone besides male property owners. Such issues were decided subsequently, by legislative actions, court decisions and/or constitutional amendments. Obviously, the Constitution was never intended as a means of specifying every last jot and tittle of what the government can or cannot do. The founders weren't XXXXXX. This is up to courts and legislatures, and ultimately, the voters themselves, to decide. Instead, it sets up a broad framework of relationships within which each generation gets to act out its specific problems and issues. Folk like Steve like to put on a show of being ""strict constructionists"" and call every court decision they dislike ""activist"". Court decisions they like can be as active as all hell, but they never object to judicial activism when it finds in their favour. For the Steves of the world, ""activism"" = ""I don't like it!"" The fact is, the Constitution isn't designed to resolve questions of basic human rights -- that is a proper function for other human institutions.","Steeeeve","312408","I'd say you are right up until saying it can be decided based on ""court decision"". On what basis does the judge decide if the constitution is ""silent"" on the issue?(assuming no other law exists). If it is so broad why do you feel there are so many specific constitutional rights? You are still a liar I see. Show where I said this. Your blind posting shows you to be a fool. Then why do you make it do so!","why-dont-they-put-ballot","abortion-debates","71","07:58 AM"

You assume the person or persons that wrote and adopted an amendment had no idea what its meaning was. They obviously did. To say it is open ended is to imply you can give whatever meaning you want to it. Words have meaning and if you decide a judge can make up there meaning then the top power is not with the people but with the judges. The anti-federalist papers said this specifically and the federalists said ""no way this will happen..they are the weakest branch"". I guess the joke was on them. It may not always be easy to know what the original meaning of a provision is but you at least need to seek that out. I'm not about to say the 8th amendment is very easily understood but when it comes to the death penalty the 8th amendment clearly doesn't imply (as an example). This is because I search for what was meant by the people that wrote it. What I don't find valid is to have a judge try to discover the meaning from whatever means he/she feels it best (foreign courts, public ""opinion"", etc). There is just no validity nor is there any standard for doing so. I never said it was simple but some things certainly are. This is the same with many professionals. For example, accounting is not that hard but when you are trained in it then it is much easier to figure out the answer. So the courts should rule based on public opinion polls? This is just ignorant and way contrary to what any founding document says.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","abortion-debates","72","08:06 AM"

Ultimately, they can be reversed by legislatures amending the Constitution. I certainly wouldn't trust legislators dependent on the electoral whim of the mob to make objective judgements here. I guess the founders decided some minimally basic rights needed to be spelled out. That didn't mean rights that didn't make it into the Constitution explicitly aren't rights defensible under the Constitution, as the IXth amendment makes clear. This is a matter for interpretation. If one accepts that the right to choose whether to continue one's pregnancy, or the right to marry the spouse of one's choice, is a basic right, then the Constitution has to protect individuals seeking to exercise such rights against a tyrannical government. There is no other sensible choice. That, buddy, is constructionist. Well, I never called you a gentleman or an intellectual. I express opinions. You resort to schoolhouse trash talk.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","abortion-debates","87","06:07 AM"

Can you provide historical evidence to show that this is the role of a judge. Yet you gave very specific rights the constitution included (some not listed)...so I guess it is not broad after all? Ok, there was zero historical evidence to suggest it was a right at the time of adoption so what evidence do you have that shows a judge can change the people's will of an amendment or provision(s) they passed? You are a liar which is why I called you that. You make claims about me that are false even after I repeatedly tell you otherwise.

Well, they've historically done it, and rightly so. The Constitution is not the final word on what constitutes a basic right, and was never intended to be, as the amendments in the Bill of Rights make clear. A tyranny against individual liberties is still a tyranny, whether it is passed by a majority or not. You have always argued in favour of mob rule, but that always leads to the lynch mob. Pity you don't recognise that. As I said, I never called you a gentleman, and I certainly do not expect you ever to behave like one. You are no constructionist on constitutional issues, and that's no lie.","why-dont-they-put-ballot","abortion-debates","90","06:46 AM"

Your claim is that the constitution isn't the final word but rather the judge is. This is ridiculous to say the least. Whether you favor the way our system of government is set up or not doesn't remove the way it is setup. If an amendment passes by the people then that is the top law....tyranny or not. No historical document shows that the judge should be the ultimate decider of issues and whether or not they are good.
