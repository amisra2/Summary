I've even taken a moment to highlight the questions the op wishes to address. If you dont want to address the arguments then that is of course your perogative. Why would you waste your time discussing consequences of certain actions if you find them irrelevant anyway?","Steeeeve","340952","I'm not ""claiming victory"" after going off track to an unrelated topic. What i am addressing is related because I am saying it is irrelevant. How is that not related? In fact, this is another example of you changing the subject matter. To point out that they are irrelevant. I thought that was clear.","poverty-pregnancy","07:41 AM","abortion-debates","46"
