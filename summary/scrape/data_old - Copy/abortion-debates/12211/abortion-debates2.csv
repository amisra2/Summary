In a car you accept the risk of being killed in a car accident. You may put on a seatbelt to prevent this but that doesn't guarantee you won't be killed. You get in a car, you accept that risk and you understand it is can be a consequence of driving. For those about to take my point further than I intend it...I am only pointing out that actions have risks and consequences....I am saying no more than that.","poverty-pregnancy","11:28 PM","abortion-debates","20"

I was just trying to point out that true control means self-control. To have an abortion is not to have control over your own body, but rather it is the way out of not having been in control of your own body in many (but not) all cases","poverty-pregnancy","02:10 AM","abortion-debates","21"

You think like a zealot, a fanatic, I dont. My opinion is just that: an opinion. I am not pro-abortion but it doesnt mean I burn abortion clinics or shoot doctors who perform abortions. This is a forum not an activist meeting place. I dont decide for you or anybody else. This is what sex does if not contraceptive is part of the equation: it procreates. That is what Nature intended sex for. It is not an opinion, it is a biological fact, like it or not. It is pleasurable for by being so it happens. That we use for pleasure only it was not the intention of Nature. By the way I am not using Nature for God. Would you feel guilty about having an abortion?

Why do you do so? As to guilt or not about abortion, I have no opinion, nor am I entitled to one as I am a man. The women I know who terminated their pregnancies felt nothing but relief. For those who claim to be ""tortured"" by their choice, therapy is available. Now, why not try coming to terms with your view of women. BTW, if I am a ""zealot"" then so were Phillips, Garrison, and Lovejoy. So were Upton Sinclair and Ida Tarbell, yet you say it as though it were a BAD thing. I was taught as a little child that if you don't stand for something you will fall for anything.","poverty-pregnancy","08:20 AM","abortion-debates","25"

Even most married pro-life couples do not have sex for the purpose of procreation but have sex for the emotional bond and/or pleasure of it. Even animals do not engage in sex for the purpose of procreation but because chemical reactions in their bodies drive a sexual emotional need. They are certainly not thinking ""I want to have sex now for the purpose of having offspring in the near future"". The emotions surrounding sex may well have been built into us through the Evolutionary process to aid in the propogation of the species, but to ignore the fact that it is the emotional drive that determines sex, not the purposes of procreation, is to severely misunderstand how nature works. Therefore, what is ""natural"" is to have sex when emotions drive you to have sex. One can claim that it is unnatural to abstain from sex when one desires it since nature would not have us abstain - just as animals certainly do not abstain from sex. There are many things that are ""natural"" (i.e. that are built into our instincts and automatic reactions that most animals engage in) that are certainly not considered ""good"" - killing someone who strongly angers you, stealing, etc. Therefore, I would not use ""natural"" as a goal if I were you. There are just too many arguements against people doing what is natural. The clear advantages of the human condition is that we can use reason and judgement to have control over our natural impulses. Where abortion is concerned, we obviously have a disagreement about the reasoned conclusions about abortion rights but to claim that the ""natural"" answer is the right one is illogical when ""natural"" is so often a bad answer.","poverty-pregnancy","10:50 AM","abortion-debates","27"
"01-14-2009","12211",2,"Another opinion","340204","Yes, people are taking a risk in having sex where the risk is higher the fewer precautions are taken. For example, with no contraceptives, there is a high risk of pregnancy. Using one contraceptive treatment runs a low risk but still significant for frequent enough sex. Whereas, doubling up on contraceptives (ex. condom plus the pill) would probably run a very low risk - just judging by statistics alone. For those that think that one treatment is enough (ex. condoms), I suspect that they do not take the statistics into account or just assume that they will not be the unlucky 1% that have the condoms fail. Either way, people who engage in sex do need to understand that there is a risk of unwanted pregnancies and STDs. However, the ethical question of how to deal with the consequences of unsafe sex is different than the ethical question of human sexuality. Having an unwanted pregnancy certainly puts a woman in a very difficult position, but I would contest that keeping the child is the only responsible alternative as, I would guess, you would claim. Abortion is also a responsible alternative - depending on the situation.","Steeeeve","340218","I am saying that the measures a person takes to not get pregnant are irrelevant to the debate on abortion.","poverty-pregnancy","12:53 PM","abortion-debates","28"

Yes, I would agree that the measures that a person takes to not get pregnant (or indeed any aspect of their sexual lifestyle) are largely irrelevant to the debate on abortion. Of course, I am sure that we continue to disagree as to what the viable responsible options are when it comes to handling an unwanted pregnancy but, as you would agree, that discussion is independent from the discussion about the responsibility people have to not get pregnant in the first place.","poverty-pregnancy","02:00 PM","abortion-debates","29"

Basically we both feel that once a human is valued (I use value to mean something like it has a right to live) than the responsible thing to do is care for the baby until born. The difference seems to be what is valued (again I use that term very broadly). I think a human is always valued while you give value to some level of brain function.","poverty-pregnancy","03:40 PM","abortion-debates","30"
