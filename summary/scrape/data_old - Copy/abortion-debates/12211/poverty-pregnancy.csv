One doesn't see any animal apart from us having abortions.

Even most married pro-life couples do not have sex for the purpose of procreation but have sex for the emotional bond and/or pleasure of it. Even animals do not engage in sex for the purpose of procreation but because chemical reactions in their bodies drive a sexual emotional need. They are certainly not thinking ""I want to have sex now for the purpose of having offspring in the near future"". The emotions surrounding sex may well have been built into us through the Evolutionary process to aid in the propogation of the species, but to ignore the fact that it is the emotional drive that determines sex, not the purposes of procreation, is to severely misunderstand how nature works. Therefore, what is ""natural"" is to have sex when emotions drive you to have sex. One can claim that it is unnatural to abstain from sex when one desires it since nature would not have us abstain - just as animals certainly do not abstain from sex. There are many things that are ""natural"" (i.e. that are built into our instincts and automatic reactions that most animals engage in) that are certainly not considered ""good"" - killing someone who strongly angers you, stealing, etc. Therefore, I would not use ""natural"" as a goal if I were you. There are just too many arguements against people doing what is natural. The clear advantages of the human condition is that we can use reason and judgement to have control over our natural impulses. Where abortion is concerned, we obviously have a disagreement about the reasoned conclusions about abortion rights but to claim that the ""natural"" answer is the right one is illogical when ""natural"" is so often a bad answer.","poverty-pregnancy","10:50 AM","abortion-debates","27"
"01-14-2009","12211",2,"Another opinion","340204","Yes, people are taking a risk in having sex where the risk is higher the fewer precautions are taken. For example, with no contraceptives, there is a high risk of pregnancy. Using one contraceptive treatment runs a low risk but still significant for frequent enough sex. Whereas, doubling up on contraceptives (ex. condom plus the pill) would probably run a very low risk - just judging by statistics alone. For those that think that one treatment is enough (ex. condoms), I suspect that they do not take the statistics into account or just assume that they will not be the unlucky 1% that have the condoms fail. Either way, people who engage in sex do need to understand that there is a risk of unwanted pregnancies and STDs. However, the ethical question of how to deal with the consequences of unsafe sex is different than the ethical question of human sexuality. Having an unwanted pregnancy certainly puts a woman in a very difficult position, but I would contest that keeping the child is the only responsible alternative as, I would guess, you would claim. Abortion is also a responsible alternative - depending on the situation.","Steeeeve","340218","I am saying that the measures a person takes to not get pregnant are irrelevant to the debate on abortion.","poverty-pregnancy","12:53 PM","abortion-debates","28"

However, I would state my view as only valuing human bodies once there is a ""somebody"" in them. Since I view the core of the existence of people as their mental existence then, yes, in our current understanding of the source of mentality, that involves sufficient brain function. However, if one could prove to me that a mental existence could exist without brain function (ex. a soul) then brain function would be irrelevant. It is the mental existence I value - the mental existence that determines the existence (in my view) of a person. Brain function is secondary and important only in the sense that it achieves that mental function. Unless I have misunderstood your view all along, you value human bodies whether or not they have ""somebody home"" - it is the human life itself that you value, not any existing mentality.","poverty-pregnancy","04:51 PM","abortion-debates","31"

At least you are up front about it, however terrifying and inhumane your POV is.","Steeeeve","340806","You and Holly apparently like to change the subject matter to something unrelated and then claim victory when the person says you are off track. I'm sorry you can't win an argument on the merits. Strawman argument.","poverty-pregnancy","11:52 AM","abortion-debates","44"

I've even taken a moment to highlight the questions the op wishes to address. If you dont want to address the arguments then that is of course your perogative. Why would you waste your time discussing consequences of certain actions if you find them irrelevant anyway?","Steeeeve","340952","I'm not ""claiming victory"" after going off track to an unrelated topic. What i am addressing is related because I am saying it is irrelevant. How is that not related? In fact, this is another example of you changing the subject matter. To point out that they are irrelevant. I thought that was clear.","poverty-pregnancy","07:41 AM","abortion-debates","46"
