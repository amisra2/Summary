I have two sisters, one who is into witchcraft and the other who is married to a golf professional. Both sisters had almost the same as my own upbringing (Christian home, kicked out around 15 years old, redeemed back around 17), but we all three chose different paths as we hit our later teen years. One sister watched the move ""the craft"" and decided to follow Wicca. She became pregnant around the age of 20 and was not married. She chose to have her child and offered it up for adoption; the child was adopted by a very wealthy family of studio execs that live in Hollywood. She later had a nude wedding and was married to her husband. She had another child which she decided to keep. Her style of mothering is... unorthodox to say the least. She openly cursed around her child so that he would not see the words as special and would not seek to use them as any child does with what is ""forbidden"". It didn't work; the child is ignorant to the point that some teachers think he is mentally handicapped and is a total brat- a creative brat, but a brat. The other sister was more into drugs and for several years my mother told me she was a prostitute and forbade me to speak to her. I later found out that she had become pregnant and decided to raise her child as a single mother and cleaned up. She used to hustle men to get money, but never did anything involving sex which is where my mother got the notion of prostitution which in a way it was, but she stopped this practice after having a child. This sister was a social outcast from my family despite being, in my view at least, the most intellectual. She later met a retired motorcycle side-car racer who was presently a teaching golf professional. They later became married and live in a wealthy neighborhood; she provides all the best that she can afford for her son, whom I am convinced is destined for greatness. This kid was beating me in monopoly when he was five and I was fifteen, and I am now in school for my Astronautical Engineering major. Since I am a male, my views may be somewhat twisted in that I have a fourth option however immoral it might be: run as fast as I can. For the sake of focus, I'm taking it off of the table. I was kicked out of my house three times throughout my childhood. As such, I learned to be very self-sufficient and somewhat emotionally-detached at a very early age. I've been to more high schools than there are grades in school for a doctor. I've been to several parties too many and never been on the safe side of things. Suffice to say, I don't think I could have the courage my sisters did if faced with a similar situation even though I am in a much better place than they were at this age by the grace of God and the forgiveness of my father. Thankfully, I have never had to worry about an accidental pregnancy, but God knows I've freaked out several times when I thought I might be. I say all of this because any of these situations could seem like a textbook abortion scenario and it ended in life. Whether for good or for worse I am thankful to live in a country where there is a choice, even if I wish for all to choose life regardless of the consequences .","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","11:02 PM","abortion-debates","1"

I do not see why I should pressure these women to choose ""life."" I fear that the whole muddled up concept of ""choosing life"" is a spurious notion. My main opposition to abortion is that it is an invasive procedure and that it is far better to have failproof contraception, as well as comprehensive sex education on sexuality, contraception, how to avoid STDs, how to avoid the necessity of an abortion.

And there is no way that I could evetr accept or support a ""rape exception"" on that basis. But you are an ##### if you believe that is the reason that I support a ""rape exception"" to a ban on ""elective"" abortions. The reason that I support a ""rape exception"" to any ""ban on elective abortions"" is because I view ""ALL"" pregnancies as a THREAT to a woman's life. READ THAT AGAIN. ""The reason that I support a ""rape exception"" to any ""ban on elective abortions"" is because I view ""ALL ""ALL"" pregnancies as a THREAT to a woman's life."" AND AND AND Because I see a CLEAR distinction that can be made, between a THREAT to a woman's life that she ""consents to"" (consentual sex). And a threat to her life that was FORCED upon her (RAPE). In my opinion, which NO-one has to accept, unless they are compelled by my reasoning,.... The woman who is RAPED has a right to defend herself against that threat that she did not INVITE (consent to). And in a case of sonsentual sex, where the woman INVITED that risk with her ACTIONS (even if not her thoughts), That justification is lost. It's much like (as I've explained in earlier threads) the cases in Vietnam where children were being used as weapons. My neighbor told me of some of these,... where it was sometimes necessary to kill CHILDREN who were either shooting at the US soldiers. Or in one case that I know of, running toward US troops with grenades. Is it wrong to kill a child? One would think so. But it's not that simple. If the child is putting your life in imminent danger, and you did not invite that threat??? In my opinion, in that case (Rape),... sad as it is to see a child killed... In cases of rape, it's justified as ""self defense"". But, also in my opinion, you can't INVITE (consent) a child into your pressence and then Kill them for being a threat. ""WITHIN REASON"". Because, I also support the ""life of the mother exception"". Where-in, even in a ""consentual"" pregnancy a ""normal"" ""managable"" amount of risk (threat) can become ""un-managable"". AND, in those cases, where ""if the pregnancy were allowed to continue"" BOTH the mother and child will die..... I support the decision to abort.

Must a woman be either celibate or raped to control the threats to her life?","Chuz Life","363808","It's a valid question. I believe I also addressed this in that old debate; Rocket continued>>> And I further note that you won't come out and clearly state that your position means that possessing birth control pills should be a crime. Birth control pills stop pregnancy in a number of ways, including stopping the implantation of a zygote. Which means they kill people, according to your understanding of what makes a person a person. I don't know how many times I have to repeat myself. ""IF IT KILLS THE CHILD AFTER IT IS CONCEIVED I AM AGAINST IT"". On the surface, it seems cut and dry, given my position. IT SHOULD BE BANNED. But of course, it's not that simple. Because, while I believe YES that a fetus is a ""person deserving of his/her right to their life from the moment of their conception"".... I also have to consider that the ""pill"" (birth control pills) are taken ""prior to conception"" with the intent of preventing the pregnancy. And not with the intent of killing a child. So, there's that aspect to consider. Another aspect that I consider is that while a child has a right to their life, from the moment their life begins,... they may NOT have a right to live off their mother's body,... if she's done everything she could do to prevent it. But alas,. the woman takes the ""pill"", Knowing full well that the ""pill"" is NOT 100% effective in preventing pregnancy. So, in ""taking the pill"", and consenting to sex,... She (and her partner) assume the responsibility, along with the risk. That's a lot to consider. Rocket asks>>> Is it too much to ask that you at least be up front about your desires? Say it: you believe that the Pill should be outlawed. Nope. it's not too much to ask at all. In fact, it's one of the best questions that you have asked yet. Keeping in mind that I believe that a person's life begins at their conception,.. I do NOT believe the Pill should be outlawed. And that is because I believe that using the pill (as prescribed) is with the INTENT of preventing pregnancy and not with the INTENT of killing a child. That being said, I believe that the ""pill"" should be studied, refined, improved upon etc.... to minimize the likelyhood of conception taking place. Time for another analogy. Every year children drown in pools. having a pool at your house with no fence, no safety guards, nothing to keep a child safe from drowning in it makes you liable if it happens. But if you have a fence. Post signs, and do everything you can (within reason) to prevent children from falling in,.... and somehow a child gets in and drowns in spite of your efforts, you are not liable. Do you see what I am getting at here? Rocket demands>> Make that admission clearly, and then call me names and tell me how this isn't about women, but about the rights of the unborn... despite the fact that you have already stated that the only important issue is what the mother was doing and saying immediately prior to having intercourse. Admission? Even that's a loaded word. I don't have to ""admit"" my positions, Rocky. They are what they are. And I've explained them as best I can above. If the ""pill"" is desinged to ""prevent pregnancy"" by ""preventing implantation"" I would say ""ban it"". because it kills a life after it's began. But if the design of the pill is to ""preven pregnancy"" by ""preventing fertilization"", It should (in my opinion) remain legal. EVEN if it occasionally ""prevents an implantation"". And, all efforts should be made to improve the pill to keep that from happening. -- Wednesday, December 24, 2003 3:27 AM","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","11:11 PM","abortion-debates","75"

A guy who in spite of that acknowledgment supports keeping abortions legal for any woman, anytime she wants one? Now, all of the sudden,.... you can't find the justification in allowing for abortions in cases of rape? I for one already posted an answer for you HERE . You completely ignored it and you are now acting as though your question hasn't been answered. But it has. It's really very simple. A rape is a medical threat to a woman's life that she did not invite upon herself. It is a threat that is forced upon her. She (a raped woman) has a reasonable right to defend herself against any and all threats to her life that are forced upon her. (same as we all do) A normal pregnancy which results from consensual sex is NOT a threat to her life which is forced upon her. If she consented to the sex, she assumed the risk and so long as the pregnancy doesn't present a 'life of the mother' risk as established by her doctors,.... she would not be as justified (as the raped woman is) in claiming she has the right to an abortion to 'defend her self.'

Even in cases of rape; as Steeeve is speaking in their defense presently in this thread. And as we eventually got to in the ACLU forums,... and as you eluded to in your remark that you oppose ""late term abortions,""... The long a raped victim waits to report the attacks,.... the louder the voice in defense of the child will be. And this is consistent with most other crimes. If someone breaks into your house and you wait a year to report it,.... you somehwat own the consequences. 3 Steeeve and I do not agree on the justifications for an abortion in cases of rape, Cunx. Not yet, anyway. And I don't know that we ever will. But for my part, when an woman aborts her child in a rape pregnancy it's not to punish the child for the acts of his/her father. That's a total mischaracterization of what's taken place. A woman has a right to protect herself against threats against her health and life that have been forced upon her. In fact, forcing a woman who is pregnant as a result of being raped is tantamount to raping her all over again. 4 Already explained this. ""You can't invite someone into your home and then kill them for tresspass and claim it was self defense."" 5 Only if you twist it to make it seem so. You see our laws regarding 'self defense' do not require (as I said earlier) that 'guilt or innocence' be established. Only that one acts on the 'reasonable belief' that the threat is real and can't be avoided and that subsequently excessive force will not be used. 6 No more so than the killing of anyone else in an act of self defense can be twisted around to make it seem as though the attackers rights are being denied. No. 7 No. A justified act of self defense is not murder even if the person killed was not intentionally threatening or aware that they were posing a threat. Tragic? Yes.

I'm not sure its valid or productive to compare words that aren't even mine to a slaver's argument that's what I'm saying .... ? Normally when people call me a facist the last think I do is ask them to explain themselves. First of all you definition is the 'NOTE' at the bottom of the page. I was more refering to the #1 definition 1. (sometimes initial capital letter) a governmental system led by a dictator having complete power, forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism, regimenting all industry, commerce, etc., and emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism. So I guess then we can say I'm more of a Leftist Fascist in the ""loose"" slang, co-opted sense of the word, since I want the individual to be free of government edicts and whim... And you are more of a Fascist in the historical, dictionary sense of the word because you support using the power of the government to prevent women from determining whether they become a parent and whether they will or will not carry a baby in their body for 9 months.","Chuz Life","364545","It most certainly is valid and productive to show someone the inconsistencies in their logic. That someone else could use exactly the same logic that you use; to defend the slavery as opposed to abortion; should give you cause to pause and reflect.

I gave my definition for what I see as a 'Leftist Fascist' as inspired by some of your comments. You might deny that the definition applies to you, personally. I expect that you will. Nice attempt to twist things around. The problem is,... I am actually for smaller and LESS intrusive government. I simply feel that (in as much as I am for smaller govt.) the Government does have a legitimate role to play in defending the rights of those too small and defensless to defend themselves; against you and those in your ilk who seek to use the powers of the government to deny them their rights, lives and personhood.

I don't know what the penalties are currently but I actually do look at abortions as killing. I support a woman's right to chose because I believe her rights supersede that of the fetus and I certainly don't want the govt. in the doctor's office with us. However, at some point the woman gives up the right to terminate a pregnancy because she's let it developer to a point where its not just a bunch of cells.
