"","07-30-2009","13045","snakespit","363053","I for one am pro-choice, yet personally anti-abortion. My wife and I both agreed long ago that we would never seek an abortion, with the exception of rape or danger to her life. As for everyone else, they need to make that choice for themselves. It is not my place to dictate what others do.","Steeeeve","363119","Why are you anti-abortion? Also, you dictate what others do all the time. Maybe indirectly but the official you vote for create laws which restrict freedoms. This is needed for society.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","abortion-debates","5","05:07 PM"

I thought about just saying ""cuz"", but I thought that might be a bit lacking. I am against abortion on a personal level, as is my wife. We believe that if we knowingly take the chance of producing a life, that we personally will care for it and raise it to the best of our abilities. I do not disapprove of it in any way other than as understood in our relationship. There are probably couples and single mothers that abortion is the best option for. It is a personal choice, not a public policy of mine. Yes and no. I agree that civilized society must restrict certain behavior from time to time. However, a person's right in choosing what is best for them is not something that should ever be restricted. If there are consequences for our actions, we should be prepared to accept them, either in the eyes of the law, or in that god fellow so many people talk about. What did he say? Judge not lest ye be judged? Now I don't know if that god fellow is for real or not, but those sound like pretty good words anyway. There were some very learned people who wrote in the bible. It's too bad that society has forgoten some of the lessons handed down to use over the last 2000 years.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","abortion-debates","7","08:08 PM"

I guess it would be something like having no real problem with eating cake you just never real want to. Ha, that's the best I could come up with Some people judge but that has nothing to do with abortion being right or wrong. Seems there is always a disconnect in the arguments of abortion. No one objects to a person choosing what is right for themselves. No one objects to the idea that murdering a person is wrong. The disconnect is that pro-life people feel the unborn is a person and therefore should choose for themselves and thus abortion would be the same thing as if you killed me. So pro-life folks never see it as a one-party problem but as a two-party problem.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","abortion-debates","10","10:24 AM"

Do you feel it is killing someone?","snakespit","363261","Well, killing an embryo or a fetus, I wouldn't call it killing a ""someone"". We feel that if we produce a life, it is our responsibility to take care of it. Balance that with the fact that we would have no problem with having an abortion in the event of pregnancy resulting from rape or grave danger to her health. So am I personally opposed to killing an embryo or fetus simply as a matter of birth control...yes. Am I opposed to others making the choice for themselves...not at all. I have a choice, and I choose no. But I am very glad I have the choice.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","abortion-debates","15","05:11 PM"

Can you explain what you mean by that? Basically, my wife and I will not participate in an elective abortion, we simply could not bring ourselves to kill the fetus that will eventually become our child. Aside from that, I could give two hoots about what anyone else wants to do. I view it as a personal decision, and everyone should have the right to decide what is best for themselves, not have their actions dictated to them by others with different beliefs. Remember, pro-choice only means having that option...it does not mean pro-abortion.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","abortion-debates","56","02:01 PM"

I'm saying do you value a born person more than an unborn in terms of what rights they are afforded. I'd assume you think I have the same right to life as some homeless guy on the corner...correct? If this is the case than I'd assume the unborn has less rights because you don't support any law to protect the unborn from being killed but you would for me and the homeless guy equally. To me that comes across as different value levels. But you do give two hoots about other people you don't know getting murdered, yes? This too is a personal decision of another (in many cases).","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","abortion-debates","57","02:35 PM"

I don't really look at it as ""unborn person"" and ""born person"". There are people, and there are fetuses. I myself would always choose to allow that fetus to become a person, but some would choose not to. I support other peoples rights to make their own decisions.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","abortion-debates","70","10:01 PM"

This is similar to what pets are to people (not the exact same I understand)...you don't want to see them killed and would protect that but if it came between the person and the pet the person's rights win.

I don't care what you call the unborn, it is wrong to discriminate like that based upon anything.","snakespit","363952","Essentially...yes, But isn't that not part of what we as human people have done over the past 200,000 years? Haven't we become sentient and educated enough beings that we are capable of forming our own opinions about what we feel is best for us as individuals? Remember, much of evolution was about the development of a larger brain that got us to where we are as a people. It is through use of discrimination, which in evolutionary terms is not always used in a negative connotation, that we became the only existing hominid about 25,000 - 30,000 year ago.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","abortion-debates","88","08:39 PM"

Surely you wouldn't say we are educated enough beings to be capable of forming our own opinion on whether or not we should kill people under 2 years of age. Why? Because we don't want that up to our own opinion, we want a law saying you can't do it. The abortion debate always will come back to the person question and as I stated many times, my position is the only one that actually refuses to answer the question (as explained in another thread).","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","abortion-debates","90","09:36 PM"
