Surely you wouldn't say we are educated enough beings to be capable of forming our own opinion on whether or not we should kill people under 2 years of age. Why? Because we don't want that up to our own opinion, we want a law saying you can't do it. The abortion debate always will come back to the person question and as I stated many times, my position is the only one that actually refuses to answer the question (as explained in another thread).","CUNxTime","363961","But there IS a difference between a 2 y/o and a fetus. It's not the same thing. Just as a sunflower and a sunflower seed aren't the same.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","10:14 PM","abortion-debates","91"

Also, the acorn and seed analogies don't work. I've explained it on this forum before but basically you are talking about sperm or egg, not an unborn.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","10:24 PM","abortion-debates","92"

If a woman is pregnant and there are complications to her health,.... Odds are if she dies, so will her baby. Likewise, if her prebirth child is capable of being delivered alive and surviving,... where is the medical beefit to the would be 'mother' to having a late term (partial birth) abortion and killing the child as opposed to just delivering the baby alive?","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","10:57 PM","abortion-debates","94"

"08-04-2009","13045",7,"Chuz Life","363971","Can you provide a situation where this has ever been the case? Expectant mother Lorraine Allard learned the devastating news that she was in the advanced stages of liver cancer when she was four months pregnant, according to the Daily Mail. Allard, of St. Olaves in the U.K., had a choice: Delay treatment to save her baby, or terminate the pregnancy to save herself. She chose the former, waiting until the fetus was viable before scheduling a Caesarean section.","CUNxTime","363973","I'm sure the exact scenario has happened.

As it was in the case you cited, these situations are typically far too complex to fit your desired template for a 'hypothetical' based argument. The main reason being is the fact that neither the mother's nor the baby's health is benefitted by the death of the other. ( as opposed to just keeping the other healthy.) My wife, for example had Toxemia. The best remedy for Toxemia is to remove the baby,... It doesn't benefit the mother in any way if the baby is removed dead (killed in the process) instead of alive. It appears that you are trying to construct or amplify an extremely rare set of circumstances,.. and then use any justifications found there to justify other abortions in a broader sense. Is this the case?","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","12:29 AM","abortion-debates","100"

A guy who in spite of that acknowledgment supports keeping abortions legal for any woman, anytime she wants one? Now, all of the sudden,.... you can't find the justification in allowing for abortions in cases of rape? I for one already posted an answer for you HERE . You completely ignored it and you are now acting as though your question hasn't been answered. But it has. It's really very simple. A rape is a medical threat to a woman's life that she did not invite upon herself. It is a threat that is forced upon her. She (a raped woman) has a reasonable right to defend herself against any and all threats to her life that are forced upon her. (same as we all do) A normal pregnancy which results from consensual sex is NOT a threat to her life which is forced upon her. If she consented to the sex, she assumed the risk and so long as the pregnancy doesn't present a 'life of the mother' risk as established by her doctors,.... she would not be as justified (as the raped woman is) in claiming she has the right to an abortion to 'defend her self.' You can't invite someone into your home and then shoot them for tresspassing. '","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","08:46 AM","abortion-debates","103"

Of course this rarely happens in the US so it is a moot point anyway. I think it has and it is the same, to me, as someone pointing a gun at two of your family members and saying ""which one lives"". Not a great situation...Lucky for a medical situation you just deal using the best information you have such as who might survive. correct, same VALUE ..glad you included that . I have the same value for a homeless person as I do a scientist who is curing cancer as well. I don't support abortion due to rape although I do understand the reason why people would want this.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","09:17 AM","abortion-debates","104"
