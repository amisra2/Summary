She should have the right embryo removed and control her own body. That's my explanation. My defense is US Law.","Chuz Life","363779","And when the laws run contrary to the sentiments expressed by (if not the letter of) the Constitution?

"08-03-2009","13045",5,"CUNxTime","363733","Who says that there should be NO laws to protect the unborn from being killed? I'd bet that Snake would support very harsh penalties for someone who murders a pregnant woman. However, when a contest of rights between a woman's right to control her body and a fetus' right to gestate, the woman's right to control superceedes... And of course people have different value levels.... a house is on fire and 2 people are going to die, most people would save a woman over a man, a kid over an adult, a family member over a stranger....","Steeeeve","363783","you can let snake speak for himself.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","08:53 PM","abortion-debates","63"

They're not yet trees, just as a fetus is not a person. The far more important question was, is, and always will remain: Who gets to make the choice?","Steeeeve","363784","They probably wouldn't care if you took the saplings too.

"08-03-2009","13045",5,"CUNxTime","363789","How'bout just a thumbnail sketch.....","Chuz Life","363796","""The thought of killing a baby because it's father is a Rapist is un-acceptable. And there is no way that I could evetr accept or support a ""rape exception"" on that basis. But you are an ##### if you believe that is the reason that I support a ""rape exception"" to a ban on ""elective"" abortions. The reason that I support a ""rape exception"" to any ""ban on elective abortions"" is because I view ""ALL"" pregnancies as a THREAT to a woman's life. READ THAT AGAIN. ""The reason that I support a ""rape exception"" to any ""ban on elective abortions"" is because I view ""ALL ""ALL"" pregnancies as a THREAT to a woman's life."" AND AND AND Because I see a CLEAR distinction that can be made, between a THREAT to a woman's life that she ""consents to"" (consentual sex). And a threat to her life that was FORCED upon her (RAPE). In my opinion, which NO-one has to accept, unless they are compelled by my reasoning,.... The woman who is RAPED has a right to defend herself against that threat that she did not INVITE (consent to). And in a case of sonsentual sex, where the woman INVITED that risk with her ACTIONS (even if not her thoughts), That justification is lost. It's much like (as I've explained in earlier threads) the cases in Vietnam where children were being used as weapons. My neighbor told me of some of these,... where it was sometimes necessary to kill CHILDREN who were either shooting at the US soldiers. Or in one case that I know of, running toward US troops with grenades. Is it wrong to kill a child? One would think so. But it's not that simple. If the child is putting your life in imminent danger, and you did not invite that threat??? In my opinion, in that case (Rape),... sad as it is to see a child killed... In cases of rape, it's justified as ""self defense"". But, also in my opinion, you can't INVITE (consent) a child into your pressence and then Kill them for being a threat. ""WITHIN REASON"". Because, I also support the ""life of the mother exception"". Where-in, even in a ""consentual"" pregnancy a ""normal"" ""managable"" amount of risk (threat) can become ""un-managable"". AND, in those cases, where ""if the pregnancy were allowed to continue"" BOTH the mother and child will die..... I support the decision to abort. Which is also a ""self defense"" justification."" -- Monday, December 22, 2003 2:17 PM","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","09:33 PM","abortion-debates","69"
"08-03-2009","13045",5,"Steeeeve","363730","Sorry, I'm honestly just trying to understand your position I have no heard it before and perhaps I'm assuming a few things. I'm saying do you value a born person more than an unborn in terms of what rights they are afforded. I'd assume you think I have the same right to life as some homeless guy on the corner...correct? If this is the case than I'd assume the unborn has less rights because you don't support any law to protect the unborn from being killed but you would for me and the homeless guy equally. To me that comes across as different value levels. But you do give two hoots about other people you don't know getting murdered, yes? This too is a personal decision of another (in many cases).","snakespit","363800","I guess it comes down to the fact that while I see both the fetus and the person synonymous with life, I do not see the fetus synonymous with the person. I don't really look at it as ""unborn person"" and ""born person"". There are people, and there are fetuses. I myself would always choose to allow that fetus to become a person, but some would choose not to. I support other peoples rights to make their own decisions.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","10:01 PM","abortion-debates","70"

Genetics, Ultrasound Technology, the ability to keep younger and younger preemies alive,... What about the 'eyes' of the Constitution? Side note; I remember when my daughter was a newborn. She was a preemie and weight only about 5 lbs. (large for a preemie.) An uncle of mine seen her for the first time at another family member's funeral. My uncle (lifelong dem) walked up to her as I had her in my arms and said ""who's this little person?"" I don't think he will ever fully appreciate the implications of his comment.

Must a woman be either celibate or raped to control the threats to her life?","Chuz Life","363808","It's a valid question. I believe I also addressed this in that old debate; Rocket continued>>> And I further note that you won't come out and clearly state that your position means that possessing birth control pills should be a crime. Birth control pills stop pregnancy in a number of ways, including stopping the implantation of a zygote. Which means they kill people, according to your understanding of what makes a person a person. I don't know how many times I have to repeat myself. ""IF IT KILLS THE CHILD AFTER IT IS CONCEIVED I AM AGAINST IT"". On the surface, it seems cut and dry, given my position. IT SHOULD BE BANNED. But of course, it's not that simple. Because, while I believe YES that a fetus is a ""person deserving of his/her right to their life from the moment of their conception"".... I also have to consider that the ""pill"" (birth control pills) are taken ""prior to conception"" with the intent of preventing the pregnancy. And not with the intent of killing a child. So, there's that aspect to consider. Another aspect that I consider is that while a child has a right to their life, from the moment their life begins,... they may NOT have a right to live off their mother's body,... if she's done everything she could do to prevent it. But alas,. the woman takes the ""pill"", Knowing full well that the ""pill"" is NOT 100% effective in preventing pregnancy. So, in ""taking the pill"", and consenting to sex,... She (and her partner) assume the responsibility, along with the risk. That's a lot to consider. Rocket asks>>> Is it too much to ask that you at least be up front about your desires? Say it: you believe that the Pill should be outlawed. Nope. it's not too much to ask at all. In fact, it's one of the best questions that you have asked yet. Keeping in mind that I believe that a person's life begins at their conception,.. I do NOT believe the Pill should be outlawed. And that is because I believe that using the pill (as prescribed) is with the INTENT of preventing pregnancy and not with the INTENT of killing a child. That being said, I believe that the ""pill"" should be studied, refined, improved upon etc.... to minimize the likelyhood of conception taking place. Time for another analogy. Every year children drown in pools. having a pool at your house with no fence, no safety guards, nothing to keep a child safe from drowning in it makes you liable if it happens. But if you have a fence. Post signs, and do everything you can (within reason) to prevent children from falling in,.... and somehow a child gets in and drowns in spite of your efforts, you are not liable. Do you see what I am getting at here? Rocket demands>> Make that admission clearly, and then call me names and tell me how this isn't about women, but about the rights of the unborn... despite the fact that you have already stated that the only important issue is what the mother was doing and saying immediately prior to having intercourse. Admission? Even that's a loaded word. I don't have to ""admit"" my positions, Rocky. They are what they are. And I've explained them as best I can above. If the ""pill"" is desinged to ""prevent pregnancy"" by ""preventing implantation"" I would say ""ban it"". because it kills a life after it's began. But if the design of the pill is to ""preven pregnancy"" by ""preventing fertilization"", It should (in my opinion) remain legal. EVEN if it occasionally ""prevents an implantation"". And, all efforts should be made to improve the pill to keep that from happening. -- Wednesday, December 24, 2003 3:27 AM","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","11:11 PM","abortion-debates","75"
