"08-03-2009","13045",4,"CUNxTime","363667","No. My beliefs aren't informed by hyperbolic, cynical, hypocritical propaganda. The CBR seems to be a sick group but they'll not effect my beliefs. I wish we lived in a perfect world where no abortions were ever needed. Since that is not the case, we've got to let the person who'd have to carry the baby to term decide how her body. Otherwise, women will not be truly free to set their own destiny .","Chuz Life","363679","Interesting take, Cunx. So,how do you reconcile that with the belief (if you have it) that one person's rights end where another person's rights begin? Or do you disagree with the idea that no-one has the right to violate the rights of another?","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","08:18 AM","abortion-debates","46"
"08-03-2009","13045",4,"snakespit","363675","So every life is precious, unless it grows up to do something you disagree with, in which case it's acceptable to kill it? Nice.","Chuz Life","363680","As I never said that ""every life is precious,"" Snakespit,... you are mischaracterizing my position in this strawman attack of yours. The Constitution (not me -which) says that 'persons have a right to their life'. The Constitution doesn't indicate that they (persons) have to be ""precious"" in order to qualify. Likewise, our Constitution says that in as much as a person has a right to their life,... that right can be denied by a 'due process' of law. Those are not my sentiments. They are the founder's sentiments who wrote it. I just happen to agree iwth them.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","08:27 AM","abortion-debates","47"

I believe that the woman's rights superseedes that of the fetus. If she doesn't want to carry it, she can't be required to do so.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","08:51 AM","abortion-debates","48"

You seem to have it all worked out to where you don't see any injustice in an elective abortion. For the life of me, I can not see how you can defend your position using the Constitution but I guess that's something you don't want to explore any further than we already have. So, why? iI it's all so settled with you and you don't want to have to explain or defend your position (or provide a basis for your claims),.... why do you bother engage in these discussion at all? Honestly, If I had your position and was as convinced as you seem to be,... I would get the hell out of here and other threads like it and move on to something else.

"08-03-2009","13045",4,"chester","363300","Just so. We who are Pro-Choice support the absolute right of pro-life people not only to hold to that position but also to practice it, within the privacy of their own families. What we will never submit to is taking that particular (and, to MY POV, peculiar) answer to a metaphysical question and giving it the force of law, to be imposed on others who do not share it.","Steeeeve","363688","but only for abortion because you actually do this with other laws...in fact, most criminal laws.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","09:17 AM","abortion-debates","51"
"08-03-2009","13045",4,"snakespit","363261","Well, killing an embryo or a fetus, I wouldn't call it killing a ""someone"". We feel that if we produce a life, it is our responsibility to take care of it. Balance that with the fact that we would have no problem with having an abortion in the event of pregnancy resulting from rape or grave danger to her health. So am I personally opposed to killing an embryo or fetus simply as a matter of birth control...yes. Am I opposed to others making the choice for themselves...not at all. I have a choice, and I choose no. But I am very glad I have the choice.","Steeeeve","363689","I guess I just don't understand why you place value on an embryo or fetus but this is clearly less value than a born person. Do I understand that correctly?","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","09:21 AM","abortion-debates","52"

I don't know how much impetus I'm feeling to defend my position since the Supreme Court and the law of the land seem to agree with me. Again, you keep asking me to explain and 'defend' my position and I have. My position is that a woman's right to walk into a Doctor and make decisions about her body does not require nor ALLOW us to interpose ourselves into the exam room. She should have the right embryo removed and control her own body. That's my explanation. My defense is US Law. I'm still hear waiting for your answer to my questions, namely... Should we then appoint lawyers to represent the fetuses in cases of rape or incest? If they're constitutionally protected they have the right to due process.

Can you explain what you mean by that? Basically, my wife and I will not participate in an elective abortion, we simply could not bring ourselves to kill the fetus that will eventually become our child. Aside from that, I could give two hoots about what anyone else wants to do. I view it as a personal decision, and everyone should have the right to decide what is best for themselves, not have their actions dictated to them by others with different beliefs. Remember, pro-choice only means having that option...it does not mean pro-abortion.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","02:01 PM","abortion-debates","56"

I'm saying do you value a born person more than an unborn in terms of what rights they are afforded. I'd assume you think I have the same right to life as some homeless guy on the corner...correct? If this is the case than I'd assume the unborn has less rights because you don't support any law to protect the unborn from being killed but you would for me and the homeless guy equally. To me that comes across as different value levels. But you do give two hoots about other people you don't know getting murdered, yes? This too is a personal decision of another (in many cases).","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","02:35 PM","abortion-debates","57"

If I am in an area where the cutting of timber is prohibited, no one cares if I stuff my pockets with acorns. They're not yet trees, just as a fetus is not a person. The far more important question was, is, and always will remain: Who gets to make the choice?","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","02:51 PM","abortion-debates","58"

I'd bet that Snake would support very harsh penalties for someone who murders a pregnant woman. However, when a contest of rights between a woman's right to control her body and a fetus' right to gestate, the woman's right to control superceedes... And of course people have different value levels.... a house is on fire and 2 people are going to die, most people would save a woman over a man, a kid over an adult, a family member over a stranger....
