"08-02-2009","13045",3,"Easyrider","363476","Not as far as I and many others are concerned. Benjamin Franklin referenced scripture at the Constitutional Convention, so it wasn't out of place there either. As opposed to liberalism, paganism, or secularism being imposed on people? Why not just adopt the bylaws of Sodom and Gomorrah?","chester","363535","Why not tell us just who it is who is imposing ""liberalism, paganism, or secularism"" on you. While you are at it, please tell us how they are doing it and why you are powerless to resist. Seems to me that you must not be too strong in your values if others can do this to you as easily as you seem to claim. BTW, the Abbey of Theleme is a more apt analogy.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","02:54 PM","abortion-debates","32"
"08-02-2009","13045",3,"Easyrider","363479","Have you and Cunxtime never read Romans 13? ""For he (the ruling authority, i.e. President Bush at the time) is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer"" (i.e. Saddam and/or evil people and nations). Hosea 8:4, ""They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not."" So, the contents of the bloody remains in the bag are ok with you?

I would wager that the ""he"" that Paul speaks of is not George W. Bush, nor any other head of state. And since you seem to want to bash others over the head with scripture rather than logic... So long as they do not contain my DNA, yes. Do you know what the word ""fallacious"" means? I wasn't talking about pictures such as these, which are reality. I used the word ""image"", as in ""concept"", like the fallacious image of the ""sink full of bloody baby remains"". And here it is, corrected to remove that little hint of sensationalism that you feel is needed to drum up support for your cause. It's not a baby until it's born. That's why we call it maternal FETAL medicine, FETAL heart monitors, FETAL distress syndrome, FETAL ultrasound, etc etc. If you eat an egg for breakfast, do you tell people you had chicken?","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","04:35 PM","abortion-debates","33"

Maybe there's hope for some of them, then, and for the NY Times and all the rest of the godless newspapers that will personalize Abu Graib but not the innocent victims of abortion.","Chuz Life","363588","You're right, Easy and I apologize for jumping the gun. I just looked at your link to the images and as you say,.... a normal thinking person should get worked up over images like that. If you were to ask Admin, I'm sure he/she would tell you that I have had posts removed for linking to images like those. And Admin would also tell you that I have appealed for the privilage to link to them. I spoke too soon when I tried to discourage you from linking to the images. I do think that combining the images with a religious argument is a bad idea. And I can't offer any better explanation now than I did Here in another forum.

Pictures of aborted babies (Warning: Graphic content - do not click on the link if you think you might be offended): CBR / Abortion Pictures The following abortion images are the backbone pun? of CBR's various public, abortion-education projects (The coins and pencils are included as a size reference and are part of the original photos) I wonder if they purposely brought the quarter along with them to the abortions they set up so that they could take their pictures or if they were just lucky enough to have one with them . All ages are in weeks from fertilization. These abortion pictures are available for download so long as you cite CBR as the image source WOW, but I guess you should give credit where credit is due and agree to the following terms NOT FULL TERMS THO! . Click specific abortion or collect all 8! picture to enlarge for your viewing pleasure or download so you can enjoy the show again and again, don't forget the popcorn! (close pop-up window after viewing). No actual babies were harmed in this CBR PRODUCTION Help CBR and win a pro-life book. That's right all this and a FREE BOOK coursesy of CBR, who could ask for anything more!!! Click here","CUNxTime","363604"," That looks like a fun game...can I try?

He is God's servant (repeated enough maybe they'll believe it), an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer."" (i.e. people I say are bad). Wow, with that kind of ####, you could justify anything. I wish 'god' had made a perfect world.... too bad. Instead of just putting the pics up the orginazation had to inject (no pun) themselves into the mix.

"08-02-2009","13045",3,"Chuz Life","363614","I'm curious. CUNx,... does the use of ridicule such as this help you to avoid confronting the reality of what those pictures showed? If it does, I can relate but only on a very childish sort of level. Centuries ago when I was in driver education, we had to watch old films (yes, prior to VCR's and DVD players),... old grainy films of police documented crash scenes. Dead bodies hanging out of cars, children spralled out in a median, etc. I was so freaked out at one point that in order to regain control, I started softly chanting,... ""Peanuts, popcorn, chewing gum."" I got in a lot of trouble, and it actually took me awhile to realize why I acted like such an #####. I wasn't ready to deal that directly with that reality. Since then, I wonder if I don't see the same behavior in others from time to time.","CUNxTime","363632","So you don't find the CBR's exploitation and callousness disgusting? If those are real and the CBR 'cares' that much, why the hell would they be playing around with them using pencils and such.

I believe they are real, Cunx. But let's assume for a moment that those are somehow fake pictures. Is there any doubt as to what an aborted fetus would actually look like? Do you honestly think it would look any different? Come on, think for a minute. The coins and pencils and such are to give a sense of scale as to how tiny the remains are and to show that however small, they have HUMAN characteristics. That they are not without a human form. It's combining human attributes with objects that everyone of us are familiar with, as a means to show how small, yet human the aborted babies were. As for winning stuff, etc. You don't get how desperate we who oppose abortion are, CunX. The fact is, many of us will try just about anything. As with the killing of Dr. Tiller,... even things which are wrong, illegal and counterproductive to the cause. But that doesn't negate the validity of the cause itself.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","12:30 AM","abortion-debates","41"

The CBR seems to be a sick group but they'll not effect my beliefs. I wish we lived in a perfect world where no abortions were ever needed.
