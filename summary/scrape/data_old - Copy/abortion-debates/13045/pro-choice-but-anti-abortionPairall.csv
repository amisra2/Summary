If it does, I can relate but only on a very childish sort of level. Centuries ago when I was in driver education, we had to watch old films (yes, prior to VCR's and DVD players),... old grainy films of police documented crash scenes. Dead bodies hanging out of cars, children spralled out in a median, etc. I was so freaked out at one point that in order to regain control, I started softly chanting,... ""Peanuts, popcorn, chewing gum."" I got in a lot of trouble, and it actually took me awhile to realize why I acted like such an #####. I wasn't ready to deal that directly with that reality. Since then, I wonder if I don't see the same behavior in others from time to time.","CUNxTime","363632","So you don't find the CBR's exploitation and callousness disgusting?

A guy who in spite of that acknowledgment supports keeping abortions legal for any woman, anytime she wants one? Now, all of the sudden,.... you can't find the justification in allowing for abortions in cases of rape? I for one already posted an answer for you HERE . You completely ignored it and you are now acting as though your question hasn't been answered. But it has. It's really very simple. A rape is a medical threat to a woman's life that she did not invite upon herself. It is a threat that is forced upon her. She (a raped woman) has a reasonable right to defend herself against any and all threats to her life that are forced upon her. (same as we all do) A normal pregnancy which results from consensual sex is NOT a threat to her life which is forced upon her. If she consented to the sex, she assumed the risk and so long as the pregnancy doesn't present a 'life of the mother' risk as established by her doctors,.... she would not be as justified (as the raped woman is) in claiming she has the right to an abortion to 'defend her self.'

Edit in progress 1 Not So, My position is that a prebirth child has the basic rights of a human individual (person Not that they have the full panapoly of rights that say an adult rape victim would have. 2 Prebirth children do have a say (a voice). Even in cases of rape; as Steeeve is speaking in their defense presently in this thread. And as we eventually got to in the ACLU forums,... and as you eluded to in your remark that you oppose ""late term abortions,""... The long a raped victim waits to report the attacks,.... the louder the voice in defense of the child will be. And this is consistent with most other crimes. If someone breaks into your house and you wait a year to report it,.... you somehwat own the consequences. 3 Steeeve and I do not agree on the justifications for an abortion in cases of rape, Cunx. Not yet, anyway. And I don't know that we ever will. But for my part, when an woman aborts her child in a rape pregnancy it's not to punish the child for the acts of his/her father. That's a total mischaracterization of what's taken place. A woman has a right to protect herself against threats against her health and life that have been forced upon her. In fact, forcing a woman who is pregnant as a result of being raped is tantamount to raping her all over again. 4 Already explained this. ""You can't invite someone into your home and then kill them for tresspass and claim it was self defense."" 5 Only if you twist it to make it seem so. You see our laws regarding 'self defense' do not require (as I said earlier) that 'guilt or innocence' be established. Only that one acts on the 'reasonable belief' that the threat is real and can't be avoided and that subsequently excessive force will not be used. 6 No more so than the killing of anyone else in an act of self defense can be twisted around to make it seem as though the attackers rights are being denied. No. 7 No. A justified act of self defense is not murder even if the person killed was not intentionally threatening or aware that they were posing a threat. Tragic? Yes. But in these cases it is the Rapist who is ultimately responsiblefor the child's death. Not the raped- victim/ woman.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","03:29 PM","abortion-debates","474"

Do I understand that correctly?","snakespit","363726","I'm not sure if you do or not. I'm not sure why you think I value a fetus more or less than a ""born person"". Can you explain what you mean by that? Basically, my wife and I will not participate in an elective abortion, we simply could not bring ourselves to kill the fetus that will eventually become our child. Aside from that, I could give two hoots about what anyone else wants to do. I view it as a personal decision, and everyone should have the right to decide what is best for themselves, not have their actions dictated to them by others with different beliefs. Remember, pro-choice only means having that option...it does not mean pro-abortion.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","02:01 PM","abortion-debates","136"

I'm saying do you value a born person more than an unborn in terms of what rights they are afforded. I'd assume you think I have the same right to life as some homeless guy on the corner...correct? If this is the case than I'd assume the unborn has less rights because you don't support any law to protect the unborn from being killed but you would for me and the homeless guy equally. To me that comes across as different value levels. But you do give two hoots about other people you don't know getting murdered, yes? This too is a personal decision of another (in many cases).","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","02:35 PM","abortion-debates","144"

I don't really look at it as ""unborn person"" and ""born person"". There are people, and there are fetuses. I myself would always choose to allow that fetus to become a person, but some would choose not to. I support other peoples rights to make their own decisions.","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","10:01 PM","abortion-debates","91"

This is similar to what pets are to people (not the exact same I understand)...you don't want to see them killed and would protect that but if it came between the person and the pet the person's rights win. This is slightly different because you actually don't have a choice to slaughter your pets...as Michael Vick found out","pro-choice-but-anti-abortion","09:20 AM","abortion-debates","74"
