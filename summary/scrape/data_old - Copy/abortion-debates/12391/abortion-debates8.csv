Also, since a human has not already begun, it does not need to begin again at the beginning of mental existence. It never existed before that. Mental existence is its first and only beginning.","Chuz Life","345730","Another Opinion, I have received my response from Admin. I won't post it as I didn't ask permission. In the interest of civility, this will be my last post to you on this. Anyone who wants to can go back and read the thread and decide for themselves how they feel about the points being made. I am content with mine and how they are made. I'm guessing that you feel the same way about yours. May the cards fall where they may.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","03:33 PM","abortion-debates","107"

Even if they are on something like a respirator which is keeping their blood circulating and oxygenized. Wait a minute,... If they are brain dead,... how is their heart punmping?","sinjin","345734","Because a beating heart does not require brain activity.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","04:05 PM","abortion-debates","108"

It matters not whether the brain has yet to develop sufficiently or has ceased to function forever. There is no ""person"" there. I understand where your original baiting was going. At some point you intended to substitute ""person"" for ""human"" and/or ""individual"" as you have already done in another thread. Intellectually dishonest IMO but I'll leave that for others to decide for themselves. You aren't worth my time.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","05:14 PM","abortion-debates","113"
"03-02-2009","12391",8,"sinjin","345758","Really? And what of this?","Chuz Life","345759","In the context of this thread, as it IS germane to this deiscussion, that quote is about CONCEPTION being the moment that a persons ""aging process"" begins,... NOT about when their ""person-hood"" begins. READ IT CLOSELY.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","05:29 PM","abortion-debates","116"
"03-02-2009","12391",8,"sinjin","345758","http://www.4forums.com/political/sci...tml#post345652 That thread isn't about when personhood begins either. What a piece of work you are. Now I'm really done.","Chuz Life","345760","That's right! I haven't even begun to debate the origins of ""personhood."" As it is foolish to do so until we have ageeance on the biological aspects of a human individual's life. I make no bones in this or any other thread that ""I"" believe a ""person's"" life and their right to it ""begins"" at conception. And you and others have made it clear that you DON'T. BUT ""personhood"" is NOT what this thread is about. So keep ""personhood"" out of it and address the biological aspects or I'll report every post that you attempt back up to the moderators. I would expect to be prevented from derailing someone elses threads and you should expect the same.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","05:36 PM","abortion-debates","117"
"03-02-2009","12391",8,"None","None","None","Another opinion","345771","Chuz Life's logical falacy is as follows: Assume there is a word XXXXX which has two definitions: Definition One which is valid in context A and Definition Two which is valid in context B. Chuz Life's logical falacy is to claim that XXXXX should always be defined as Definition One for all contexts and therefore, it also applies to context B. That is not how definitions work. ----------------------- Note, if you did not follow the comparison to Chuz Life's strategy, here XXXXX represents the word ""human being"" or ""a human"" or ""an individual""; Definition One might be something along the lines of ""member of the species Homo Sapiens"" with context A being ""discussions about human biology"". Definition Two would be ""a person"" with context B being ""social issues (including abortion)"". Chuz Life is simply using definitions the wrong way - playing distorted semantics to try to win a point based on an illogical premise.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","06:44 PM","abortion-debates","118"

In other words, if you are the one against whom someone is using illegal debate tactics, then you should be the one to complain. I am not the forum police that goes around complaining about anyone who violates rules. I complained because rules were violated against ME. Secondly, you have been unable to support any logical arguement about any claimed logical fallacies on my part. I challenge you to actually explain the logical fallacies you claim I make and not run away, like you usually do, as soon as I make a point that you cannot counter.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","08:12 PM","abortion-debates","120"
