"03-10-2009","12391",15,"iangb","346727","...the times I've done this, you've ignored my posts. I have done it twice, now. Collecting past responses in a third attempt (and adding lots more - see part 1)... here goes nothing. 1) Of all the words you've linked too as 'suggested reading' in your OP, you haven't included the most important one: 'life'. Probably the most relevant definition from dictionary.com defines 'life' as ' the animate existence or period of animate existence of an individual '. Something alive also manifests ' the power of adaptation to environment through changes originating internally '. Neither of these features match a zygote.","Chuz Life","346729","You could have stopped rght there,... That's your opinion of course. But it's biologically incorrect to suggest that a living human organism in the earliest stages of his or her life is not ""alive"" or living a ""life."" Especially when it's your desperate desire to use (of all things) a semantic argument for their denial. Don't get me wrong, iangb... I'd like to debate the issue with you even further. You raise a couple interesting points. The problem is that you bury those points in a semantic play on words as if you really believe that you can pick and choose (for other readers) which definitions apply and which ones don't,... I (on the other hand) encourage people to look things up for themselves and form their own conclusions from that. (SEE HERE) You may allay your own doubts for yourself,.... But, you are certainly not going to convince me that a living human zygote is not really ""alive"" or living it's (his or her) own life. Especially with evidence such as ""an organism's aging begins at conception"" and ""invitro-fertilizations"" proving the opposite of your semantic claims,... with reality. There's is just too much incontovertable evidence to what you are claiming. P.S. Since you are so sure of your views and basis, Why haven't you voted in the poll yet?","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","07:11 PM","abortion-debates","214"

Absolutely, just as your own semantic nitpicking is your own opinion. If you want to prove my opinion wrong , I'll need some evidence that a zygote is animate, or that it can adapt to an environment. 'Semantic argument'? I have to say, that's remarkably ironic given that: you've repeatedly blurred the line between 'individual' (adjective) and 'individual' (noun) and you've relied heavily on your own 'cherry-picking' of definitions. ...so I've looked things up, I've formed my own conclusion. I've even presented my opinion to you with my reasoning - something which you have as yet failed (for the most part) to do. You still seem to have an issue, unfortunately. If you think you can find a counter-argument in alternate definitions, feel free... but I doubt that you can, else you would have used it by now rather than use a watered-down version of your original 'wow, your logic is inferior' line. So much for an open mind, alas... So... you have a quote from someone saying that cells age from conception, and the fact that an egg can be fertilised externally before it is replaced in the mother. Of these two, one is 'reality' (your quote is not free from semantics either...), and one is relevant (a zygote is still dependent on the mother after it is fertilised). Neither is both. You provide arguments that are largely semantic-driven. You refuse to address counter-arguments because ""it's too semantics-based"" - how chimeraism and identical twins are 'semantics' is something that I suspect you will refuse to justify. I suggest you take your own advice regarding 'intellectual honesty'. Either deal with semantic arguments - or don't use them yourself. Either let people make up their own mind - or don't mock them when they have without an argument of your own. Don't pretend to support 'reality' - unless you can deal with arguments that use facts against your views. EDIT: Because my response (which I gave in my first post in this topic) is not covered adequately by the possible poll choices.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","07:39 PM","abortion-debates","215"

"03-10-2009","12391",15,"chester","346675","you show an unwillingness to truly understand the pro-choice position. you equate choice with being pro-abortion. you would interpose the power of the state to trump the power of a pregnant woman to make a determination of what is in her best interest. you simply fail to grasp the idea that it is not up to you, me, or the law to impose our/its opinion on what is at best a metaphysical question. you do not understand that we in the pro-choice camp will support the woman involved no matter what choice she makes.","Winston Smith","346735","the choices are to kill or not kill, and you haven't answered why a human being has the right to kill another? if a woman decides not to kill, why would she need the support of the pro-abortion camp, or any support from anyone?

"03-10-2009","12391",15,"iangb","346738","Why should it take a moderated debate for you to answer my questions? I don't have the time for an MD at present, sorry - but why the want, though, to make this 'official'? Very odd timing, given that you've just accused me of 'playing semantics'. Could it be that, when faced with a 'reality' you do not like (chimera organisms and identical twins), you revert to old habits? It's especially odd given this word, and what you've tried to imply it means. It's largely used by psychologists (see 'Jungian Psychology') - the 'biological' terminology refers, not to as DNA DNA ' organizer ', but to cell-cell interaction (amongst other things). You may want to read this for more info - ' In the embryonic development of a zygote, gradients of mRNAs and proteins, deposited in the egg by the mother as she formed it, give rise to cells of diverse fates despite their identical genomes. . None of this is particularly relevant, however - it's just satisfying intellectual curiosity. To get to the relevant stuff - you've mixed your definitions. 'Individuation' refers to ' regional differentiation along a primary embryonic axis ' - that is to say; the fact that cells in an embryo - all with identical DNA - end up as different types of cells depending on where they are within the embryo. It's cells becoming individualised -not the organism itself. Jung (and others) talk about 'individualisation' of personalities, but I really hope you're not going to try and play that off as anything like relevant - as it isn't linked to embryos and it isn't 'biological' individuality , so you would fail on both counts (I suppose you could argue than anything with social individuality is biologically an individual, but that's kinda tenuous (Siamese twins?) - and besides, social individuality cannot develop without a brain, so you would be doomed on that one). Note also that 'individualization' takes place in the embryo. The fertilised zygote does not begin individualization until it first divides and becomes an embryo - you can see that this is by necessity, because until the organism is composed of more than one cell, it cannot (by definition) be composed of different types of cells. As such, 'individualisation' (the process, you claim, by which individuals become as such), only even begins at the embryonic stage, not at conception. In order for an abortion to be 'killing', it must be first proven that a foetus is an individual - both biologically and (arguably) socially. Otherwise abortion kills nothing more than a collection of cells - just as the spermicide in a condom kills millions of cells.","Chuz Life","346749","If you don't have the time, who cares ""why the want."" A good reason would help you ""make the time?"" or what? Yeah,... that must be it. HUH,.. and if not conception,... when did that begin again? No, iangb... I didn't mix anything. The subject of this thread is ""when does a human individual's life biologically begin ."" This definition is but one of many that describe in the most intricate details ""how"" that life is began. With a single cell division that (through individuation) forms, grows, develops and further matures the new child until one day he or she reaches a point,... after which even you can't deny them their rights anymore. The key word in all of it is ""begin."" Again,... the key word is ""begin."" The new individual's unigue DNA is created when? The aging process ""begins"" when? Clearly, individualation begins when cell division does. But if conception had not taken place, there would be no cell division of the new individual's DNA. Would there. Arguably? If it's arguable, it's hardly an absolute. Consider the current legal definition for a ""person."" That's relevant, isn't it? PERSON 1: ""natural person"" 2: the body of a human being also : the body and clothing of a human being Example: had drugs on his person 3: one (as a human being or corporation) that is recognized by law as the subject of rights and duties Note the absense of a requirement for thought, ability to breathe, feel pain or anything like that. And,... Tell me something, Iangb... a Human fetus is a living human organism,... biologically unique, alive, etc. What kind of body does it have if not a "" human body ?""

"03-11-2009","12391",15,"None","None","None","jim's trucking","346782","""human individual's life biologically begins."" I believe the above was used to clarify the original poll question. At conception is the only plausible answer. Simone's claim that life began billions of years ago cannot be applied to individual beginnings. The human individual's identity as a human being begins when the sperm fertilizes the egg, whether it's in a womb or a petri dish. It is a being...it is human. It is a human being. It is alive. It is a living human being. The fact that our general shape and physical architecture has been formulated for millions of years has nothing to do with individual beginnings. We each begin our existence as a human at the time of conception. Any argument to the contrary is an attempt to justify abortion without any feeling of guilt. For a while the mass of cells is just that...a mass of cells with no brain, no nervous system, no heart, no lungs, no toes, no anus, no mouth, no genitals...nothing that can be recognized as a separate organ or appendage. It still has an identity that makes it unique from all other human forms, no matter what stage the others are in. We establish benchmarks for stages of life in order to treat the various age groups appropriately differently. We have the aged, middle aged, the young adults, the teenagers, the adolescents, the pre-schoolers, the toddlers, the babies, the newborns, those about to be born, those in the third trimester, those in the second trimester, those in the first trimester and those that were just recently created by fertilization of the egg. Drawing a line somewhere and claiming that life does not begin before this particular time is completely unnecessary. Life begins at conception. That's all you need to know.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","12:03 PM","abortion-debates","222"
