"03-02-2009","12391",7,"Another opinion","345694","There, I was just saying ""I'm glad you do. I was starting to wonder..."" to the question of how I was defining personhood, since it wasn't clear that you understood that up to that point. However, subsequently you tried to change the definition of human being to be purely the biological one. Just because YOU wanted to keep the definition of human being as a purely biological one doesn't mean that I agreed to do that. So, you twisted my words to reword them in a meaning that I never agreed to - a misrepresentation of my views, which is an illegal tactic.","Chuz Life","345698","How many times do you have to hear that ""I get it?"" You claim that "" biologically a human being's life begins at conception,... but their personhood doesn't "" How you can conclude that is a mischaracterization is beyond me. Not to mention your petty personal attack (maligning of my character) in claiming I don't know how to use a disctionary is probably a rule violation as well. But, I digress.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","01:45 PM","abortion-debates","94"

"03-02-2009","12391",7,"Another opinion","345712","It is obvious that you DON'T get it since I have stated it so many times and you keep ignoring it.

Aparently, you aspire to some kind of beliefs that human beings reproduce by way of metamorphosis (like butterflies and frogs do) Where-by two adults have sex, create a ""human organism"" that is NOT a ""human"" but that (if allowed to live long enough) might become one.

The word ""a human"" is a word that is defined as ""a person"" by the dictionary. That is how an embryo can be a ""human organism"" without being ""a human"" - obviously, since it is not a ""person"" yet where ""a human"" is defined as ""a person"". Do you even bother reading the sentences that are written by your opposition? How many times does that need to be repeated before you understand it. I am certainly not expecting you to agree with it, but at least make SOME effort at reading comprehension to understand what your opposition is saying. Otherwise, you will keep misrepresenting their views. As for defensiveness, that only happens if people know they are wrong and try to explain themselves around it. In this case, logic is on my side, not yours. My logic is sound so I have no need for defensiveness - it is the logical truth I present. I would not characterize your responses as defensiveness either since you clearly THINK you are right - mainly because you don't see your own logical inconsistency.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","02:36 PM","abortion-debates","102"

But, you have offered absolutely nothing short of your claims and plays on semantics to support them. The purpose of this thread was the debate the moment that an individual human being's ""biological"" life begins. Scientists (as I have provided multiple lengths to show) have concluded that a ""human individual's"" aging ""begins at conception."" Which would make sense, a human's aging would likely begin when their life does. What you are doing, AO (to put it bluntly),... you are putting the onus on the new human. To live long enough and grow, mature and develop to an arbitrarily drawn point..... after which you can't find any reason to deny them their ""personhood"" any longer. And, I don't care how much science you use to support an arbitrarily drawn point (like brain activity or conciousness or ability to feel pain) it's still just an arbitrarily drawn point.

Like an ""individual frog."" It looks like it begins at fertilization (conception.) You tell me,... Also, here is the life cycle for humans. QUOTE; "" The human life cycle begins at fertilization , when an egg cell inside a woman and a sperm cell from a man fuse to form a one-celled zygote. Over the next few days, the single, large cell divides many times to form a hollow ball of smaller cells. On the sixth day after fertilization, this hollow ball burrows into the wall of the mother's uterus, or womb. The cells then form three layers that fold and bend into the more complex shape of an early embryo. Gradually, the cells begin to become different from one another, forming, for example, the nervous system and the circulatory system.""
