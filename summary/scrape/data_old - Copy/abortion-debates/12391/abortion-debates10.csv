"03-05-2009","12391",10,"Chuz Life","346136","Iangb, aparently, you need to brush up a little on the proper useage of a dictionary. I'm not english major myself,... but even I know that the word "" independence "" is used as an adjective in the definition you quoted. ""independent EXISTENCE."" Which begs the question; ""does a human zygote, embryo, fetus have an ""existence"" which is distinguishable from that of the mother's ""existence?"" The answer is yes. So you are wrong on your assertion. Additionally, you have failed to address the ""compound organism"" aspect of a ""mother, child"" relationship during pregnancy. So it is you, iangb who needs to brush up on your comprehension skills.","smiley","346149","Er . . . given that you are attempting to correct someone else's error, you should note the following. The word ""independence"" is a noun. You are correct that ""independent"" is an adjective, but a zygote is certainly not independent of its mother. Oh, and it's ""apparently"" with 2 p s, ""usage"" without the 'e' in the middle and you should have said ' an English major'. When asking someone to use a dictionary, it is advisable to do so yourself (or at least a spell check).","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","11:55 PM","abortion-debates","136"

Especially where spelling is concerned. I do have a love of words and an ever expanding vocabulary. But I digress (again.) The definition for ""individual"" states; 5. Biology. a. a single organism capable of independent existence . b. a member of a compound organism or colony. Does a human zygote ""exist"" independently from it's mother. I'm Not asking ""can it live, survive and thrive independently"",... but can (does) it ""exist?"" The answer is YES. And again you ignore the ""compound organism"" (symbiosis) aspect of a pregnant ""mother child"" relationship. Just as an amoeba (parasite of any sort) is an ""individual organism"" even when attached to a host,... so is a human Zygote, embryo and or fetus. Now, I've been through enough of these debates to know that you (or someone) will now try to claim that a human zygote, embryo, fetus is then a parasite. They aren't but go ahead with the claim,... meanwhile I'll re-locate the reference materials which shows they aren't.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","10:50 AM","abortion-debates","137"

Not ""can it live, survive and thrive independently,... but can (does) it ""exist?""","iangb","346197","You've (deliberately?) missed out a word in your quote here - you've dropped that all-important 'independent' which is a part of (adjective to) 'existence'. That final part should read: ""...but can (does) it 'exist' independently ."" Well, then, we're going to have to look at ' independent '. All of them are kinda relevant (in that none of them match a zygote) - but the one with probably the most relevant context is #4: 4. Not dependent; not depending or contingent upon something else for existence, operation, etc. Are you claiming that a zygote would continue to exist, to operate 'normally', if it was removed from the mother? Note also that this highlights the flexibility of 'life' (which, I notice, you fail to link a definition to in your New and Improved OP). As medical science progresses, the point at which an organism can exist outside of the womb gets pushed further and further back.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","12:20 PM","abortion-debates","138"

Yes. That's a simple biological fact.

It's precisely how things like cloning and invitro fertilization are possible. Both of which (by the way) further support the biological fact that a human individual's LIFE begins at and by their individual conception.
