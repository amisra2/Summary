"02-26-2009","12391",2,"None","None","None","Another opinion","345141","I've decided to proactively resolve the discrepancies between the poll question and the opening post by letting the poll question take priority and ignoring the contradictory conditions set in the opening post. So, taking the poll question literally, ""When does a human individual's life biologically begin?"" would mean the biological start of the life of an individual . Given that question, my answer would be - the biological life of an individual starts at the same time as the individual himself/herself starts - sometime during the third trimester when the previously existing mindless body gains a mental existence based on the biological development of cortical connections that allow that mental existence. The closest choice in the poll to that is ""immediately after the second trimester"". Though it is far from certain that mental existence starts at the very beginning of the third trimester, I am willing to give the fetus the benefit of the doubt and say that, if mental existence might be possible, then assume that it exists - making the fetus an individual (where ""individual"" = ""person"" by the dictionary definition). The biological life of a human body exists before that time, but it is not an ""individual"" yet nor can it belong to a not-yet-existing individual since, after all, the individual does not exist yet so how can any being that doesn't exist yet own or have any claim to anything - including a body. So, I have now marked ""immediately after second trimester"" for the reasons mentioned above.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","04:17 PM","abortion-debates","17"

It doesn't matter to you at all that the biological existence of single celled creatures are constantly discussed and defended by you right here on this forum. But when it comes to human life, even though you know that it must be alive at conception in order to grow and develop at all, that in order to preserve your pro abortion position that you can validly claim that biological life is measured by mental existence. Is that the answer you really feel is honest and true according to what you know intellectually about biology AO? I think not. And you just lost major points with me based on your willingness to allow a purely scientific question to be answered based on your philosophical preferences regarding abortion.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","04:46 PM","abortion-debates","18"

Thanks!","Another opinion","345153","I would think that the term ""horse"" is generally perceived to only be a technical term denoting that species and, for most of us, is not a term that carries any horse-equivalent sense of personhood and does not necessarily automatically bring to mind the personality of a horse (except for those people who work with horses or deal with animal rights). For most of us, it is a fairly neutral term - the equivalent of the ""individual human life form"" term I used in a previous post. So, given the neutrality of that term for most people, then I would agree that the life of a horse begins at conception. I would be interested to find which equivalent term you come up with for human life forms that similarly carries no extra meanings for most people.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","06:04 PM","abortion-debates","22"
"02-26-2009","12391",2,"Chuz Life","345109","""Biologically speaking, when does a human individual's life begin ?"" Before you post an answer to this question, Please note the specific wording and the meaning of the words posted. (links provided) Note also, that I am not asking ""when does life begin?"" or ""when does personhood begin?"" We can get into those other issues later. Right now I am oly interested on establishing the moment that a ""human individual's life biologically begins."" In short, how far back in time can a human individual's life be traced before there is no more evidence of that individual's biological existence? Answer carefully, I have follow-ups!","ShadowPikachu","345159","I voted: ""Immediately after the second trimester!"". That is when the mind finally develops and the foetus can finally have the ability to have a consciousness (unable without the mental function before this point). The body itself that will become a human individual is creted at conception, but the actual individual cannot be traced back before the second trimester when the mental faculties develop.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","06:33 PM","abortion-debates","23"
"02-26-2009","12391",2,"Another opinion","345146","The life of an individual (= person) begins when the individual begins. Since I don't view any living body without a mentality as an individual (i.e.person), then, by my definition of individual/person, it can only come into any existence (biological or otherwise) once it does so mentally. Where, pray tell, is the inconsistency? What are you talking about?!?! I have no idea. First of all, my position is not pro abortion. I would be quite happy if there were no more abortions performed ever but not because of a law (which I would find unjust) but because of eliminated need for abortion through improved contraception, sex education, etc. I am not claiming that all biological life is measured by mental existence. I am claiming that biological life of INDIVIDUALS is measured by mental existence since, in my view, mental existence is what defines individuals. I am not the one who chose the term ""individual"", Chuz Life was. Blame him not me for the consequences of that choice of terms. On a last note, the bottom line is that, in my view: Individual = Person = human mind So, without a human mind, no individual / person can exist in any way, shape or form. Hypothetically, I would even say that a body is not necessary. If minds could be proven to exist without bodies - i.e. a soul - then I would call that body-less mind an ""individual"" or ""person"". In reality, there is no evidence whatsoever of souls, so this remains purely a hypothetical point.","Archangel","345160","But you know very well, or should that just because mammals develop in stages, it is ludicrous to deny ones biological existence simply because it hasn't developed the mental existence yet. It is still a TOTALLY unique individual which is evidenced by the number of individuals you have met in your lifetime; no two ever being identical in every way. Even identical twins who share DNA are unique in their own ways based on their personal experiences within the same family, and their personal interpretations of those experiences. But here you are saying that because a fetus hasn't yet developed a mental existence it is somehow sub-human and not deserving of rights. It is inconsistent by any rational thought process. I'm talking about defending the fact that even single celled creatures which have no mental existence and never will, are defended by you and your comrades as no doubt alive as biological organisms. It seems to me that since you intellectually and personally know that every single human being you have ever and will ever know was once a single celled creature with no mental existence also, that you could make the common sense leap that these fetuses have real and true value from the moment of conception. It's not as though there's a question as to what species they will grow into after all. Your rationale is contradictory and inconsistent at the most basic level of reasoning based on what you personally know about science and life. Of course your position is pro abortion. You just prefer to call it pro choice because you are still playing a game of semantics. You think that by defining the issue as you do that you somehow are relieved of the guilt for supporting a practice which leads to the death of 1.3 million babies each year in this country alone. You justify your pro abortion stance by making this about mental existence when you know darn well that if that child was just allowed to complete its normal and natural gestation period, that we have 7 BILLION living examples of real evidence on Earth as we speak of what it will grow into, which proves what those babies really are in truth and in fact if only allowed to develop normally rather than be snuffed out. The bolded exposes your erroneous position since you know all too well that people will design their views based on what they choose to believe according to their personal morality. You are attempting to justify abortion which you claim to find abhorrent by redefining what makes us human. You know that every single doctor on Earth today will tell you that a baby is alive at conception and immediately starts to grow and develop at that time. But like a slick lawyer who thinks you have found a loophole in the law, you proudly claim that because the fetus has no mental existence, it really isn't biologically alive yet. Talk about redefining words AO, you take first prize. You know what those babies are, even at conception. They are alive and developing. But you will actually justify their destruction since they haven't yet developed a mental existence yet. And you see that as a rational and moral position? I reject and pity such morality as found truly wanting. I don't even know where to start in critiquing this statement since I can't prove to you that the soul exists in any terms you would appreciate either, even though I know it does. So I will just say this, when a question like this which determines the life and death of perfectly innocent babies, how dare you not choose to ere on the side of caution and in favor of the baby since you have no evidence that the soul does not exist. What absolute arrogance and hubris to vote against preserving life when you admit that you have no evidence at all that human beings are soulless creatures. I also find it sad that since you have personally experienced love, joy, sympathy for others, compassion, ecstasy along with all of the other emotions and characteristics which make us human that you will just write these 1.3 million unborn human beings off each year due to a lack of evidence. Is that your idea of a moral and rational perspective? Would you vote for the defendant to be put to death if they aren't sure he's guilty of murder AO? Of course you wouldn't. Yet you will defend the murder of 1.3 million unborn babies per year because you have no evidence they have a soul. Do you see what I mean by inconsistent? And I must add contradictory based on what you know and have personally experienced in life about what makes us human. You're either the most morally compromised person I know (along with these other pro death advocates) or you are the most unobservant regarding your ability to judge and discern the value of our human natures.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","06:37 PM","abortion-debates","24"
"02-27-2009","12391",2,"None","None","None","iangb","345211","Loaded question. There are several possible answers to this question, so I'll include 'em as I go. It's worth noting that verifying your prediction, Chuz, is not evidence of 'weakness'. It's evidence that an organism does not immediately 'become alive'; it's an ongoing, subjective process - you may as well ask 'at what point does a painting become a work of art'? I'd start with a related question to you: at what point does a person become officially 'dead'? Medically, you die when your brain ceases to function . Going by this, you officially become 'alive' when your brain starts to work in the first place - which is usually about second-trimester. I would guess that this would be my main response. However, there are others... At what point do the cells in your body become 'alive'? Most of the cells that make up your body at the moment were not alive when you were born , so the question must be rephrased to 'at what point were any of the cells that once made up any part of your body alive'? This would be back before conception, when the relevant egg and sperm cells were created in the relevant parents. A third version: ""at which point were you an alive human individual ?"" Ignoring the personality-based semantics of the word 'individual' - until the umbilical cord is cut, a baby is at best a symbiote to it's mother, at worst a parasite (the only reason the mother's body does not attack the baby as a foreign intruder is that the foetus uses the same tactics (very similar proteins, even) to 'hide' from the mother's immune system). The answer (semantics aside) here would be - when the umbilical cord is cut. I could probably go on, but I think you've got my point. As a direct answer: you are alive when you become concious, because we define death as permanent loss of conciousness. However, the whole concept of 'life' as something with a definitive start and end is a false one.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","09:12 AM","abortion-debates","27"

If you want to debate us seriously, you need to stay rational and not substitute quips for actual debate. Otherwise, this thread will quickly degenerate into a flame war. Is that what you really want? Though I disagree with iagb, I know where he is coming from. You make no effort to even try to understand where the opposition is coming from. Until you do so, you will not be taken seriously as a debater and threads you start will degenerate into flame wars. To try to explain my understanding of iagb's position along with my disagreement: No being suddenly spontaneously generates out of nothing. The human zygote, for example, was an unfertilized egg just moments prior to being fertilized by the sperm - where the egg and sperm were both alive and human. The egg and sperm themselves also did not spontaneously generate out of nothing but where produced by other living cells within the human body. Tracking backwards, this path of life can be traced back all the way to the beginning of life on Earth. So, if it is life itself that is in question, then I would agree with iagb that the issue is far more general. Iagb's also presents other interpretations. However, you questioned us about the life of a unique individual horse. The reason that I agreed that a particular horse's life starts at conception is not because there was not a horse life form alive before that but because the unfertilized horse egg could have been part of any infinite number of potential future horses and did not uniquely define that horse. Only once that unfertilized horse egg was fertilized did it gain the complete set of DNA that defined that PARTICULAR horse and set the process of growth going for that particular horse. This reasoning can also be applied to human life forms but, with humans, one has to be FAR more careful with the language that one uses since terms used for humans are far more loaded with meaning than terms used for horses.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","10:19 AM","abortion-debates","29"
