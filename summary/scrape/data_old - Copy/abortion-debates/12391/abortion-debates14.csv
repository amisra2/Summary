Does that not include your own displays of ""smug certainty?"" I can provide quotes and links to some of your comments if you like. Our science (specifically biological facts) are supposed to be ""one size fits all."" Our biology is the one thing we all have in common; regardless of our race, religions, creeds, colors or traditions. Why a strict adherence to those biological facts is an affront to you and your ilk reveals more about the (lack of) depth to your thinking than our own. That you fought so hard (along with AnotherOpinion, Smiley and others) to deny the bioloical facts which prove a human individual's life begins at their conception has hardly been ""contributive"" to the debate, either. I digress. I'm not concerned with morals. I pass no judgments as to right and wrong,... only on "" what is ."" I leave the morality to individuals to struggle with on their own,... with the truth that is presented to them. Interesting,... so tell me... ""Chester, do you agree that a child's right to their life should begin when their life does?"" I'm just asking,...","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","08:50 AM","abortion-debates","201"
"03-10-2009","12391",14,"Chuz Life","346598","AO,... You are aware that scientists routinely define human beings ""purely"" in the biological sense,... aren't you? Have you ever searched for any references to support your claims that they do not? This search took me all of 1 minute. The reading of these threads would take hours,... but just from the text I see in the search, You should e able to see that your allegation above is not correct. Human's, ""persons"" if you will are biological creatures complete with a biological ""beginning"" to their uniquely individual life. Your desperate desire to deny that fact is completely understandable. But, I don't see how you can expect myself or others to share in your ignorance of the mounting pile of evidence that prove against your claims. Biologically speaking, a human individual (being's) life begins at and by their conception. It's a scientific fact. Whether you or I like it or not. It is what it is . Words also often have more than one meaning. Run, for example, generally means ""to move fast on foot"". However, that is not what we mean when we say ""the water is running."" Run can also mean ""to flow (said of liquids)"". Neither of these meanings apply to the use of run in ""John runs a small bookstore."" Here run means ""to manage"". Dictionaries usually list all the unrelated meanings, giving each a separate number. (You can confirm this by looking up run in any of the on-line dictionaries listed at the bottom of this page.)","Another opinion","346693","You are missing the point and always have been. Whether or not science defines an embryo or zygote as a ""human being"" when speaking in a scientific context is irrelevant to any debate that will eventually lead to discussion of social issues. That is why I have not engaged in such a debate - because of its irrelevancy. The definition of the word(s) ""human being"" or ""a human"" or ""an individual"" that are relevant to any social context is ""a person"" - by the very dictionaries that you quote. Do you or don't you understand the concept that words are used differently in different context and you cannot just switch back and forth between the definitions at your pleasure? That is how dictionaries work - you have to stick to the relevant definition. In this case, if and only if we were going to STAY in a biological discussion (ex. launch into a discussion of the physical traits of human beings as opposed to, say, chimpanzees), then using the words human being / human / individual might stay purely biological since their definition of ""person"" is relevant to the social issues more so than biological issues. You want to use definitions illegally by switching back and forth between them - clearly either a purposely dishonest tactic or a tactic that is a result of your ignorance of how dictionaries work. To demonstrate how dictionaries and their relevancy toward the use of words work, take an example: The word ""right"" can be defined in multiple ways: From dictionary.com : 1. in accordance with what is good, proper, or just: right conduct. 2. in conformity with fact, reason, truth, or some standard or principle; correct: the right solution; the right answer. 3. correct in judgment, opinion, or action. 4. fitting or appropriate; suitable: to say the right thing at the right time. ... 11. (often initial capital letter) of or pertaining to political conservatives or their beliefs. Using your use of words, that would mean that the Right (meaning conservative politics) is right (meaning good and truthful) because they both use the same words. Perhaps this wasn't the best example because you probably believe that Right is right but hopefully you are logical enough to get my point. Same word - different definitions for different contexts. That is something that I am seriously doubting that you understand. ---------------------------- On a last note, here is part of a description on how to use dictionaries from yourdictionary.com: http://www.yourdictionary.com/library/article003.html : Note that I bolded their term ""unrelated"". As with the multiple definitions of ""human being"", ""individual"", etc. - the biological definitions are UNRELATED to the definitions of these terms as ""person"". You don't understand how dictionaries work since you think that they ARE related - WRONG !","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","10:16 AM","abortion-debates","202"

The difference is, our doctrine doesn't cause the death of a million plus babies a year and yours does. So to attempt to require us to remain silent in the face of such a genocide is another example of your inability to to defend your position so you attempt to simply stifle debate by claiming your right to murder the unborn. And where have I brought up any metaphysical aspect to this debate at all? I can defend my position, and do defend it consistently without ever using the bible or my personal spiritual convictions. The law which allows abortion would become irrelevant if only people acquired a moral and just perspective which caused them to respect their own babies right to life rather than their selfish reasons for killing him/her. That's a joke cap0, it must be. Or else it's just more self delusion on your part because you have no code of ethics to speak of or defend. You defend the cold blooded murder of 1.3 million babies a year after all, even though you know that fully 96% of them are healthy viable babies being carried by healthy women who didn't become pregnant due to rape or incest. You make no exceptions at all in the babies favor at all. they aren't even a consideration in your so called ethical code. So by what standard do you claim to have one? Are you just lying or are you deluding yourself cap0, cuz you aren't kidding anyone here regarding your claim to possess a code of ethics. The woman would pay for it you schmuck. By what rational standard should society be expected to pay for her medical check up when the goal is seeking an objective determination to abort the baby? That you even ask this question just further proves that like all good socialists you want the nanny state to pay for every single irresponsible act which people create for themselves. More solid evidence that you have no code of ethics.

Unsupported, unsubstantiated opinion noted. Yeah,... and (as per the links I provided) they likewise pertain to the biological aspects of ""individual"" ""human beings."" Your point?

"03-10-2009","12391",14,"Another opinion","346709","If you show me a quote from your earlier posts that shows that you do understand that different definitions are used in different contexts, then I might retract my characterisation. Up to now, you have not showed that. It is supported by the fact that the dictionary defines ""individual"" or ""human being"" SEPARATELY in a biological context (ex. member of the species homo sapiens) and SEPARATELY in a social context (by defining it as ""person""). Those who know how to use definitions know that those are SEPARATE definitions Since ""person"" is largely a philosophical term about which there is no current consensus (as also stated by the Supreme Court in Roe vs Wade), then defining ""human being"" or ""individual"" within its definition of ""person"" as being purely biological is your one choice out of inumerable choices people could make in defining ""person""hood. It holds no authority. I will openly admit that my definition of person as starting at mental existence also has no global authority. That is what happens when a term remains unclearly defined by society. We debate what it SHOULD mean. You have your opinion, I have mine. Both of our philosophical views about personhood are equally supported by science since each of us scientifically pinpoints the point in time where the development relevant to how we define pershood starts - yours at the start of the individual human body, mine at the start of the individual human mind. You don't seem to get that there is no authority that says that personhood is defined purely as biological life. That is only YOUR OPINION. Well, it is clear that we are not going to stay only in the biological domain - ex. exploring the different physical traits between humans and apes. It is clear that the topic you are heading toward is abortion - a social context where the social definition of ""individual"" or ""human being"" as PERSON will apply, NOT the purely biological one. If you were in the least bit trustable a person, then we might allow such a debate in trust that definitions would be properly modified once the context was modified. You have shown yourself to be very untrustworthy in properly representing our opinions so it is clear that you will be taking the dishonest path of distorting our words. That is why nobody has fallen for your tricks yet. It is actually amuzing to watch you continue to try... It is not only MY desire. It is the use of the terms as dictated by the dictionary. That is how language works. The dictionary gets to dictate how you use words, not I. Learn how to use one properly. You MISINTERPRET their view as saying that, just as you had misinterpreted mine. Show me a link where someone stated EXACTLY those words - i.e. ""a human individual's life beings at the moment of their conception"" and I might believe that you are not lying about their views.","Chuz Life","346712","Just quoting it now so, it won't get away!
