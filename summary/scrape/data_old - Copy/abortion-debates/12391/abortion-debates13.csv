"03-09-2009","12391",13,"Another opinion","346587","We covered this direction in an earlier discussion when you chose to speak of the beginning of the life of horses. As I said then and I repeat now, the term ""horse"" (or, in this case, ""chicken"") do not carry any conotation of person, as do the terms a ""human"" or ""individual"" or ""human being"". As such, one can define them purely biologically - which is something one cannot do if one speaks of ""humans"", ""individuals"" or ""human beings""..","Chuz Life","346598","AO,... You are aware that scientists routinely define human beings ""purely"" in the biological sense,... aren't you? Have you ever searched for any references to support your claims that they do not? This search took me all of 1 minute. The reading of these threads would take hours,... but just from the text I see in the search, You should e able to see that your allegation above is not correct. Human's, ""persons"" if you will are biological creatures complete with a biological ""beginning"" to their uniquely individual life. Your desperate desire to deny that fact is completely understandable. But, I don't see how you can expect myself or others to share in your ignorance of the mounting pile of evidence that prove against your claims. Biologically speaking, a human individual (being's) life begins at and by their conception. It's a scientific fact. Whether you or I like it or not. It is what it is .","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","05:37 PM","abortion-debates","181"

That is about as irrelevant to the topic as anything you might bring up. It's time to move past this angels-on-the-head-of-a-pin irrelevancy and move on. The real question, the one that none of you seems to want to confront, is who gets to choose whether or not a particular woman in a particular situation continues her pregnancy - the nanny state or the woman herself? Archie proposed that a doctor make the determination. Do you agree? If so, who or what pays the doctor in question? It's long past the time that this discussion should move out of the gate.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","06:00 PM","abortion-debates","183"

But I will say that when we begin to move on to my next point and lines of question, you will see the answer to your question above begin to reveal itself. Ohhhhh a clift-hanger! I gotta run!

It's more fun to play the role of picador to your raging bull .","Archangel","346620","What I find most incredible about this statement is that you proudly compare yourself to probably the most profound example of cowardice and unfair play represented in any sport on Earth. I doubt you have ever actually seen a live bullfight in your life and do agree that comparing yourself to a picador is sadly as accurate a comparison as could be made regarding your contributions and debating style here. But let me tell you about what they and you truly represent. First of all, the Bull isn't raging at all when it enters the stadium, much like the people who attempt to debate facts with you, only to be met with your ignorance and snide denials of reality. But then come the picadors on horseback and much like your self confessed reason for being here, they proceed to stick the Bull in its back with hooked picadors which stick in, take hold and are intended to cause the animal to bleed as much as possible so as to weaken it for the matador. So you see, the picador's sole purpose for being there is to make as unfair and lopsided a fight as possible in the matadors favor who will then come out to a sufficiently weakened animal so he can then kill it for the entertainment of the bloodthirsty masses without actually risking his own life. So yeah cap0, I see the accuracy of you comparing yourself to what a picador represents to the Bull. What I can't understand for the life of me is why any rational or decent human being would take pride in painting such an ugly picture of himself (accurate as it is in your case).","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","07:56 PM","abortion-debates","187"

The complete and total depth of your defense of abortion is a woman's right to to choose it over any concern for the life she carries within her. You refer to the maternal condition as a pregnancy in order to dehumanize the baby she carries. And to you, this represents an intelligent argument for the justification of 1.3 million abortions per year in this country alone. You deny any facts offered and ignore the reality that real, living and developing human beings are being murdered in order to satisfy, condone and promote the continued irresponsible behavior of untold numbers of women who get multiple abortions as they use it as a form of birth control. You are so immoral and deluded that you are incapable of making the connection between the sexual promiscuity which results in these abortions and contributes to the epidemic of STDs which are ravaging our civilization from allegedly the responsible women who have been raised in this culture of death down to prepubescent girls who are faithfully following their example. None of which you have ever condemned, criticized or even spoken against in any debate. Your motto is if it feels good do it, and screw the consequences or the social implications for our society. Now come back with some snide and cliche quote which somebody else originally said, which is all that you're good for.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","09:23 PM","abortion-debates","190"
