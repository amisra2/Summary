Your physical existence as a human individual did not come into being until the particular conception (fertilization of that particular egg in your most immediate ancestor [your mother] ) that resulted in your birth. You were not existing thousands of years ago. Only the blueprint was developed.","simone","346880","I consider my father to be an immediate ancestor as well. Of course, I know who my father is.

It's just that you didn't come into being until the conception that resulted in your birth.

"03-28-2009","12391",16,"jim's trucking","346782","""human individual's life biologically begins."" I believe the above was used to clarify the original poll question. At conception is the only plausible answer. Simone's claim that life began billions of years ago cannot be applied to individual beginnings. The human individual's identity as a human being begins when the sperm fertilizes the egg, whether it's in a womb or a petri dish. It is a being...it is human. It is a human being. It is alive. It is a living human being. The fact that our general shape and physical architecture has been formulated for millions of years has nothing to do with individual beginnings. We each begin our existence as a human at the time of conception. Any argument to the contrary is an attempt to justify abortion without any feeling of guilt. For a while the mass of cells is just that...a mass of cells with no brain, no nervous system, no heart, no lungs, no toes, no anus, no mouth, no genitals...nothing that can be recognized as a separate organ or appendage. It still has an identity that makes it unique from all other human forms, no matter what stage the others are in. We establish benchmarks for stages of life in order to treat the various age groups appropriately differently. We have the aged, middle aged, the young adults, the teenagers, the adolescents, the pre-schoolers, the toddlers, the babies, the newborns, those about to be born, those in the third trimester, those in the second trimester, those in the first trimester and those that were just recently created by fertilization of the egg. Drawing a line somewhere and claiming that life does not begin before this particular time is completely unnecessary. Life begins at conception. That's all you need to know.","Chuz Life","348204","Thanks, Jims... This is the type summary/ short essay I have been hoping for. I have been away from things (attending to some family matters) and I had almost completely missed this one. I don't know how anyone could possibly disagree with this point of view in any way. It will be interesting to read the responses to it,... which I am doing now. Thanks! And welcome!","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","11:21 AM","abortion-debates","231"

Therefore, there should be no law whatsoever regarding a woman's right to choose whether or not to take her pregnancy to term. If the profetallifers are correct, moral persuasion should suffice; if not, they have lost the battle in the marketplace of metaphysical concepts. Establishing law in the are is symbolic of their loss in the clash of ideas. As Richard Cardinal Cushing, John F. Kennedy's confessor once said, ""Any faith which needs the force of law to enforce its tenets is not worthy of the name.""","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","09:54 AM","abortion-debates","236"

Mr. Justice Blackmun went out of his way to say that the Government will not be put in the position of picking and choosing among the varying metaphysical answers to the question of the beginning of life and therefore leaves the question in the hands of each pregnant woman to choose the answer that is most congruent with her own answer to the question. Did the decision go far enough? No, but it's a good starting point. It was about as far as the Court felt it needed to go in 1973. I would as strongly oppose a law or decision which requires abortion as I do one which would outlaw it. The government which today may prohibit abortion may well be the same government which tomorrow will require it. The government which claims to power to do either violates human rights.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","12:42 PM","abortion-debates","238"

The one thing we all have in common as ""human beings"" is our biology,... The logic would follow that a biological ""persons"" rights should begin when their biological life does. the metaphysics.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","01:00 PM","abortion-debates","239"
