Before you post an answer to this question , Please note the specific wording and the meaning of the words posted. (links provided) Note also, that I am not asking ""when does life begin?"" or ""when does personhood begin?"" We can get into those other issues later. Right now I am only interested on establishing the moment that a ""human individual's life biologically begins."" In short, how far back in time can a human individual's life be traced before there is no more evidence of that individual's biological existence? Answer carefully, I have follow-ups!

This concept would suggest that in human being (s) aging begins in the moment of conception and progresses relentlessly through intrauterine life, childhood, adolescence, adulthood and advanced age."" - www.brainaging.ro","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","10:27 AM","abortion-debates","1"

In answer to your question, life begins when the growth and aging process begins for the unborn child. And that is at the moment of conception. Any attempts by the opposition to define the value of life based on any other criteria other than growth and development in the womb is to endorse a double standard which is untenable when applied across the board.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","10:43 AM","abortion-debates","2"

I'm hoping that we can just focus on this one question for now. There will be plenty of time to address things like ""value of life"" and all that in my following threads. I hope you understand. I really just want to get an idea of where everyone stands on just this one point. ""When does a human individual's life biologically begin?"" You answered it very well when you stated that it begins when their aging and growth begins. It's clear that you understand the applicable meanings of the words. Human, individual, biological, life and begin! Thanks again. P.S. It is my prediction that those who chose to call themselves ""pro-choice"" on elective abortion will not participate in this poll and discussion,.... even though it speaks directly to the heart of the stances of both those who are for and against the legality of it.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","10:55 AM","abortion-debates","4"
"02-26-2009","12391",1,"None","None","None","Another opinion","345113","I found myself unable to answer this poll since your wording carries contradictory conotations. Specifically, the word ""individual"" is often used synonymously with ""person"". Indeed, the very definition of ""individual"" which you linked shows that it is indeed defined as ""person"". You may say that you did not intend this poll to be about the beginning of personhood but, by using the term ""individual"", you seem to suggest just that. ""Individual"" is a term which is too laden with meaning to pretend that it is a neutral term. So, the contradictory directions in the poll leave me unable to answer it honestly. To specify my own views, I think that the bodies of unique individuals / people start at conception but that body does not become a person / individual until the beginning of mental existence, which cannot start before roughly the third trimester.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","11:07 AM","abortion-debates","5"

(as far as your side avoiding the poll) The second paragraph of your post is more in line with what I was looking for. It's clear that you agree that (at least) a person's living body (a living human individual's body) begins at and by their ""conception."" Assuming that you are confident in your views and opinions, AO.... why are you being so defensive and evasive? (splitting hairs between human individual's and persons-- do you know any human individuals who are not persons?) Aren't you the least bit concerned about how that reflects upon your intellectual honesty?","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","11:43 AM","abortion-debates","6"

Are you not living the life of a human individual? For society to establish and to protect your ""individual"" rights to the life you are living, it becomes necessary to establish the point in time at which your ""individual"" life began/ begins. As per your claim above,.. (using your logic) NO-one has an individual right to their life,... so long as someone in the chain of ""human life"" remains alive.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","11:51 AM","abortion-debates","8"
"02-26-2009","12391",1,"Another opinion","345119","Do you deny that you gave contradictary directions in the poll in saying that it is the start of biological life of ""individuals"" that you are interested in while claiming that you are not interested in the thoughts about beginning of personhood? When individual = person (by YOUR very own definition link), then the contradiction is made clear. Do not blame us for your lack of clarity. It is not the body of an individual until an individual comes into existence. Again, individual = person by the very definition which you linked. Before that body becomes an individual / person by gaining some mental existence, it is just a body with ""nobody home"" belonging to no one except the mother since she is the only individual in existence at that point in time who has any relevance. Again, how can you claim that I am evasive if it is YOU who purposely made the post unclear. If you do not have specific challenges to the points I made, then the evasiveness is clearly on your side. Again, do you or don't you agree that individual = person and, therefore, your challenge to define the begining of life of an individual without considering that definition is a contradictary nonsensical challenge. Do not blame us for your mistaken logic.","Chuz Life","345121","I have been dispatched to a job that will likely go well into the night. But you have already addressed the aspect of my poll that i was seeking from you, AO... You stated that a human being's living body begins at and by their conception. I'll leave you with one questions (actually intended for a seperate thread and poll) ""do you support the seperation between church and state?"" (I do) I will respond to some of the rest of this as soon as I can. ""work happens"" ---- arrrrrgh!","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","11:59 AM","abortion-debates","10"
"02-26-2009","12391",1,"None","None","None","simone","345123","What does an individual human consist of? First of all, I should think that an individual human being would be truly individual, that is separate in and of itself and not contained within the womb of another human being and solely dependent upon the bodily systems of that other human. An individual human being would be truly independent, able to survive if its dam did not, albeit as an infant dependent upon the good will of other human beings, but breathing independently, taking nourishment independently, not having its waste materials taken in and disposed of within the body of another human being.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","12:14 PM","abortion-debates","11"
"02-26-2009","12391",1,"None","None","None","Penfold","345130","We also need agreed definitions on the meaning of ""human"" and ""biological life"" in the context of the questioner, as already we see the potential for cross purposes in the disingenuous use of the non-neutral term ""individual"". Are we taking about any human of the genus ""Homo"" or only h.sapiens? Biological too, has several meanings. Strictly speaking it is anything pertaining to life or living things, but the term in the question has an additional reference to life. Is there an alternative life to biological life? Is it the blood relationship of the offspring which is being questioned, or organic matter? The entire framing of the initial question is as flawed as the inherent premise it contains.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","01:33 PM","abortion-debates","13"

Why am I not surprised? Unless you have enough intellectual courage to answer the challenges I posed to you about the contradictions in your presentation of your post / poll, then your claims of our weakness ring very hollow. The answer to the disagreement is simpler than you imagine. Either: 1) Use more neutral terms that don't introduce a contradiction. For example, you could phrase the question ""Biologically speaking, when does an individual human life form begin""? That ""human life form"" or other such neutral terms, do not carry with them the definition of personhood - at least none that I can detect. OR 2) Retract the statement in your opening post which says: As long as you retain that second point while holding on to the term ""individual"", then you are being contradictory and illogical. So, take your pick or come up with your own idea on how to get around the contradiction. I would be willing to go either way.","when-does-human-individuals-life-begin","02:06 PM","abortion-debates","15"
