The deliberate and systematic destruction of a national, racial, religious, political, cultural, ethnic, or other group defined by the exterminators as undesirable. ""Abortion is certainly deliberate and systematic. There is nearly one abortion for every two live births in America. Abortions are performed in a vast network of clinics around the country, almost 4,000 a day, 1.3 million a year, and more than 40 million since abortion was legalized in 1973. Furthermore, abortion targets a very specific group of human beings: unwanted, unborn children. While the appropriateness of calling abortion ""genocide"" depends on what definition of genocide you are using, it is a plain and simple fact that abortion is the systematic destruction of millions of human beings. This nation, and the world as a whole, has a sad legacy of dehumanizing people who have something we want or get in our way. Abortion supporters are infuriated at the notion that abortion is comparable to the Holocaust because they incessantly argue that the unborn aren't people. This is exactly the same argument that is always made to justify crimes against humanity. They're not really people. This is what Hitler said. This is what America said when it used to count blacks as 3/5 of a person. If we can't compare atrocities past to atrocities present, then the term ""never again"" loses all its meaning. At the end of the day, if the unborn are people (and they are), then abortion is not only comparable to past crimes against humanity, it is, in fact, the greatest holocaust of all."" from www.abort73.com","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","02:12 AM","abortion-debates","1"

"02-03-2008","10837",3,"Ghost Rider","299921","Last I checked anybody who murders a pregnant woman doesn't face two counts of first degree murder, only one. Fetuses aren't counted as actual persons according to the law, so I don't see how murder of a nonperson could be illegal, or even possible. If a fetus isn't going to be counted as a person then abortion can't truly be considered a crime now can it? A judge on Friday upheld Pennsylvania's fetal homicide law in the case of a woman who is charged with assault of a pregnant woman that resulted in the death of the fetus, the AP/Philadelphia Inquirer reports (AP/Philadelphia Inquirer, 1/27). Corinne Wilcott was charged with ""murder of an unborn child"" and ""aggravated assault of an unborn child,"" after Sheena Carson miscarried her 15-week-old fetus four days after Wilcott allegedly attacked Carson. Wilcott's attorney Tim Lucas previously argued that the state's 1999 Crimes Against the Unborn Child Act is unconstitutional because the state allows a woman to terminate her pregnancy through abortion in the first 24 weeks, but under the statute in question a person could be charged with murder for killing a fetus of any age (Kaiser Daily Reproductive Health Report, 12/02/2002). Erie County, Pa., judge John Trucilla said that there was ""no contradiction"" or ""double standard"" between the fetal homicide and abortion laws because a woman can choose to have an abortion, but has no choice in an attack that results in the death of the fetus, the AP/Centre Daily Times reports.","lesz","299948","As a matter of fact, I think the law in some states now treat a foetus as a separate person in the case of an assault against a pregnant woman. For example, this case appeared in 2003: Judge Upholds Pennsylvania's Fetal Homicide Law in Fetal Murder Case And in Georgia and probably elsewhere, anti-choice activists are pushing the so-called ""Human Life Amendment"" to the state constitution that would make a foetus a legal person: Georgia's House Bill 1 (HB1) This would criminalise any act that resulted in the death of a foetus. So there are legal precedents for treating a foetus as a separate person, and if the law changes this definition, well, that becomes the new definition, irrespective of what biologists or women think or want. The law doesn't have to make sense, after all, it can be a completely arbritrary convention. As a man, BTW, let me agree with you that I don't think men really have anything valid to say about individual abortion decisions. It's never their body under consideration. However, they are entitled to general moral views on the matter. My own view is that within certain limits, such decisions should be left up to individual conscience, and no-one, male or female, should be able to dictate to any woman what she does with her pregnancy. The limits I have in mind are pretty close to the compromise that already exists in US law, with abortion being available virtually on demand in the first trimester and increasing restrictions thereafter, as I believe a foetus gradually acquires a certain right to life during development. However, I don't believe it's an absolute right that always overcomes the mother's right to life and make her own decisions especially if her own life is threatened by the pregnancy.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","03:16 AM","abortion-debates","33"

If legislators see fit to bring additional penalties for such an action, I can't see that they are acting unconstitutionally. No, of course not. There is a recognised legal and moral distinction between death by accident and deliberate homicide. Or feticide, whatever. If an assailant so injures a woman that she loses the child she wanted, then that is a serious additional injury to her that the law can legitimately take into consideration. Please note, I am not arguing for making elective abortion illegal, just pointing out that the situation is fairly complex.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","06:18 AM","abortion-debates","60"

You are all over the place it seems. Rights are not given by the law. I agree, the law and the way the law treats someone does not affect their personhood. Now apply that to an unborn baby and you see that personhood does not get defined by just the law. And roe v. wade was only referring to the original meaning of the 14th amendment. So it was not an overall view. Then what do you state? Were blacks treated as equal persons under the law in the 1800s? If not, then explain why they were still persons if the law didn't say so. Answered in the last post. Why are you scared to answer? Because you know the human embryo and fetus is a human being? Fallacy aside, that does not fit the definition so no. The unborn does fit the definition and is therefore a human being. You just did in the last post Roe vs. Wade never declared an unborn not to be a person...just not a person in terms of the 14th amendment. So were blacks inferior beings in the 1800s? You haven't claimed no species? Then what species is the unborn? Only to a fool. So if the law changes then you'd be against abortion? Human being is a biological issue and it just so happens the unborn is defined as a human being (no surprise). And you agree with this? Perhaps I should start counting how many times you use the word ""lie"" (or variation) in your posts. The good thing about this is that it gives me an idea of who I am posting too.

Why do you think morality falls under philosophy? Assuming no moral absolute? If you assume this then there is no reason why you should or shouldn't. Murder, stealing, animal cruelty. using phrasing like ""Mr. Washington BigWig"" is borderlining on a logical fallacy by tainting the water. A scientist has a standard by which to judge...the ethicist does not unless the ethicist has concluded a moral standard and if there is a moral standard then the soybean farmer would still have just as much room to talk on the matter. The reasons for this are vast but in short, morality is not an observation or investigation. Morality is the conduct of the people to right and wrong.

They were legally property. Substance over form qualifies here, just because the constitution doesn't take the time to define who is or isn't a person doesn't mean it doesn't inherently do so. It did say they were property though and that makes you not a person. How would you compare them? Don't you already have to have good and evil to decide this? If you comparing them and good and evil doesn't exist then how could you say one is good and one is evil? You can have a morality based on yourself but it leads to evil things (at least in my perspective) and basically declares yourself god. The problem with this is not that you can't do it but it doesn't hold up as a morality that can work. Many people do it though and I call it a selfish mindset. If you base your morality on your feelings then you can't say what Cho did at Virginia Tech was wrong...at least not wrong in the general. He went by his feelings and that led to evil....granted this is an extreme example. It just removes any objective standard and you wouldn't be able to convince somebody of an evil if they feel it is good. But like I said, its possible to have a morality based on this. ha, my problem is I can't find my kind of soap....its always at the bottom and deep in the shelf or something. I don't understand. Do you mean like a ""built in"" morality the evolved? Seems like an interesting thread but would take lots of thinking haha. Its a little deeper of a conversation than abortion.

"02-08-2008","10837",8,"Steeeeve","300453","Human rights aren't just in the law. Do you think rights just exists in the law? If so then if a right doesn't exist how can one say they have a right to something? How is that backpedaling? And how can you say they were due human rights when the law didn't say so? And if they were always persons and the law didn't treat them as such then how were they persons if the law is the only thing that defines this (as you seem to think)? You are all over the place it seems. Rights are not given by the law. I agree, the law and the way the law treats someone does not affect their personhood. Now apply that to an unborn baby and you see that personhood does not get defined by just the law. And roe v. wade was only referring to the original meaning of the 14th amendment. So it was not an overall view. Then what do you state? Were blacks treated as equal persons under the law in the 1800s? If not, then explain why they were still persons if the law didn't say so. Answered in the last post. Why are you scared to answer? Because you know the human embryo and fetus is a human being? Fallacy aside, that does not fit the definition so no. The unborn does fit the definition and is therefore a human being. You just did in the last post Roe vs. Wade never declared an unborn not to be a person...just not a person in terms of the 14th amendment. So were blacks inferior beings in the 1800s? You haven't claimed no species? Then what species is the unborn? Only to a fool. So if the law changes then you'd be against abortion? Human being is a biological issue and it just so happens the unborn is defined as a human being (no surprise). And you agree with this?

But a baby doesn't have a parasitical existence, it's a completely, physically separate organism. Anyone can look after it. Foetuses have fewer rights, however, in part because of their total, physical dependence on and umbilical attachment to their host, and in earlier embryos, because of their lack of sentience, or even a brain to be sentient with.

"02-10-2008","10837",10,"Steeeeve","300766","Don't you already have to have good and evil to decide this? If you comparing them and good and evil doesn't exist then how could you say one is good and one is evil? You can have a morality based on yourself but it leads to evil things (at least in my perspective) The problem with this is not that you can't do it but it doesn't hold up as a morality that can work. Many people do it though and I call it a selfish mindset. If you base your morality on your feelings then you can't say what Cho did at Virginia Tech was wrong...at least not wrong in the general. He went by his feelings and that led to evil....granted this is an extreme example. I don't understand. Do you mean like a ""built in"" morality the evolved? It would happen by random chance. Like a dice has no reason to land on 6 but it can. I don't know if it is hypocritical so long as you don't hold the position that you can't force morality on others. I think you can but not to an unlimited extent... So with an imperfect way to impose morality the best way to operate (according to our founders at least) would be to vote on things to some extent. Even this gets it wrong though. (1) I'd argue that morality is not at the whim of the people but rather is an outside standard by which we should try to achieve. The problem is morality in the law is at the whim of the people which is really how a lot of it is enforced. (2) I'd argue people are flawed and are unreliable. Which begs the question about how you can trust what I'm saying now It's just 4forums haha...not like we are writing a book","electrolyte","301174","I don't think so, in the same way that you can say that one square is larger than another without knowing the actual area of either. Remember, the approach I'm exploring here is relative comparison, not comparison to an absolute. I think this assumes that people are overwhelmingly inherently evil. I don't think that most people would up and kill a stranger given the opportunity to do so without legal (or eternal) consequences. It seems to me that it can largely work when the vast majority of people share the same set of morals. So, hypothetically, if my morality system comes from me, then it is selfish even if my morality tells me not to be selfish? I don't see how your labeling is justifiable. After all, we're talking about morals which almost by definition limit overt selfishness. (On the other hand, do we need to explore the idea that we behave morally only because it makes us feel good/prevents us from feeling guilty? I hate to admit that this may be a necessary consideration.) He also had mental problems, which calls into question how appropriately this example can be applied. I mean that morality might be a ""trait"" (if I may use that term a bit more loosely than a biologist would) that was selected for because it increases fitness within groups. This would explain seemingly inherent moral values, morality in different species (especially those lacking higher brain function). If this is the analogy, then why does the die get thrown in the first place? If you mean that you might be able to convince others of a better morality system, I hope that you're right. I'm not sure whether this is really possible or not. Some stories suggest it is, but so is brainwashing, which shouldn't count... Imperfect, lousy, unreliable... but any worse than any known alternative? I agree completely. This is why we've worked out reliable ways to analyze and/or test claims. And so far, this discussion is really making me think, which is good, and doubly so because it's a nice change from trying to refute repeated nonsense laced with ridiculous fallacies.

"02-11-2008","10837",10,"electrolyte","301174","I don't think so, in the same way that you can say that one square is larger than another without knowing the actual area of either. Remember, the approach I'm exploring here is relative comparison, not comparison to an absolute. I think this assumes that people are overwhelmingly inherently evil. I don't think that most people would up and kill a stranger given the opportunity to do so without legal (or eternal) consequences. It seems to me that it can largely work when the vast majority of people share the same set of morals. So, hypothetically, if my morality system comes from me, then it is selfish even if my morality tells me not to be selfish? I don't see how your labeling is justifiable. After all, we're talking about morals which almost by definition limit overt selfishness. (On the other hand, do we need to explore the idea that we behave morally only because it makes us feel good/prevents us from feeling guilty? I hate to admit that this may be a necessary consideration.) He also had mental problems, which calls into question how appropriately this example can be applied. I mean that morality might be a ""trait"" (if I may use that term a bit more loosely than a biologist would) that was selected for because it increases fitness within groups. This would explain seemingly inherent moral values, morality in different species (especially those lacking higher brain function). If this is the analogy, then why does the die get thrown in the first place? If you mean that you might be able to convince others of a better morality system, I hope that you're right. I'm not sure whether this is really possible or not. Some stories suggest it is, but so is brainwashing, which shouldn't count... This is why we've worked out reliable ways to analyze and/or test claims. And so far, this discussion is really making me think, which is good, and doubly so because it's a nice change from trying to refute repeated nonsense laced with ridiculous fallacies. Yeah, but I'd like to continue a discussion that has real potential for intrigue and civility, even though my half-devil's advocation approach may be aggravating for you. Afterword: Uh, this was typed before I read the rest of the thread. Feel free to take this conversation to a different thread.","Steeeeve","301204","Yet when one compares a square for size they already have an understanding of what larger means and what size means. If you are comparing for which one is ""more good"" then you already have an understanding of what good is. I'd say we are inherently evil and often times it is the legal consequences or lack of opportunity that holds us back. A good example of this is internet downloading. Without a question this is stealing yet people find it to be ok because lack of enforcement (easy to get away with) so it is justified to being ok. Of course if you would have asked someone prior to the internet if stealing music was ok (said just like that) then almost everyone would have said yes. In fact, today you don't see people walk into Best Buy, take the CDs, and walk out as if it were a-ok. So I think people will do the evil thing if given the opportunity. The evil thing always is the selfish thing. Yet someone would already have to have morals for this to work. Otherwise you would everyone saying ""i'll get more morals from society"" and because everyone is saying that society doesn't have a set of morals..just confusion. so you get back to the idea that morality has to be based on yourself. I morality based on yourself would be made to benefit yourself. This system won't always lead to a selfish result or always be immoral but it does lead to a moral system that can't justify itself. Well at this point you say there is an outside standard for judging the abnormality of a person. This would have to mean that morals can't be made in ones own mind because you say Cho can't do so. So now we get into a situation of what this outside standard of morality is (ie. it isn't based upon yourself). Yet many moral values are disputed...this forum is proof of that. If it is a trait then you also get into the argument used on the gay rights forums which is if it is an inherent trait then you can't say its wrong (which I actually disagree with). That goes back to my Cho example. If that is inherent then how does one say Cho was wrong and not just dancing to his DNA? For curious sake, has there been any research to suggest this is the case? I was just providing an example of something that happens at random. Everything is brainwashing to some extent. I say the difference is that a brainwashed brain would have reasoning and logic twisted as opposed to being consistent with what one says. Welcome to my world. It isn't one side of the fence that comes up with boneheaded ways of thinking. I generally don't read peoples posts who agree with me because it is a waste but sometimes I do and I am embarrassed that they believe what I do. I thought about actually finding a way to address to terrible posters on these forums because they actually end up bringing the good posters down sometimes. I have some ideas if you ever are interested (PM only). And yes this discussion has made me think as well...which is a bad thing sometimes ha. Oh trust me, this discussion is about 1000 times better than the previous one I had on this thread. Better to talk to one that disagrees with you and doesn't have their head in the sand then someone who disagrees with you and refuses to listen. I go out of my way to hear other opinions which I think is the right way to do it. For example, I attended a Hillary Clinton rally where Bill Clinton spoke the other day.

"02-11-2008","10837",10,"Another opinion","301240","This thread is following the trend of so many previous threads in getting tangled up in applying definitions from one context into another context. Yes, one of the definitions of human being is member of the species homo sapien. Another definition of human being is ""person"", where the definition of ""person"" then also has a number of official definitions. Since many of these words (human being, person, etc.) have multiple definitions, one can pick and chose from among those definitions however one likes to support one's arguement. The important thing, in my view, is not the general definitions themselves but in what is generally meant in a particular context. Where human rights are concerned (which is why I would think the definition of human being becomes relevant), then the United Nations charter is a good place to look to see what is meant by human rights. The UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights was set up because of all the cruelty and suffering brought about by human conflicts and oppresive regimes. This is what drove its creation and what largely defined its scope. From Article 1 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (from http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html ): From the very outset, the issue of human rights is applied to born humans - where no issue of rights of the pre-born is even addressed. So, any appeal to human rights of a zygote or fetus is most definitely an extention of the usual and accepted meaning of ""human rights"". That does not mean that human rights need to be limited to born people but, if you want to extend the application of human rights before birth, you need to present a good case. I personally think that a good case can be made to extend human rights to a late term fetus - mainly because it can have a mental existence and can suffer. What compelling reasons would someone on the pro-life side have for extending the idea of human rights to a zygote or early fetus or embryo?","Steeeeve","301242","I disagree that the UN gets to define human rights.

"02-12-2008","10837",11,"electrolyte","301314","One doesn't need to be taught what makes him or her happy or feel good. I agree that this is sometimes true, but I would consider copyright infringement much more trivial than murder or stealing goods. For what it's worth, I no longer download copyrighted material. I can say that the exploration that I used to do caused me to buy more music than I otherwise would have. While this is not justification, I can honestly say that it (my personal actions only) cost the artists nothing (because I would not have bought their releases) and that it in a few cases increased their revenue because I bought albums. In fact, I'm looking for one now that I haven't been able to find yet... I have, on numerous occasions, given back incorrect change, and not because I was afraid of being ""caught"" or of being judged by a supreme being. Was this selfish and evil? This is not dependent upon a pre-existing set, only that whatever the set is, whenever its origin, it is shared. I'm not saying that people must get the morals from society. I'm still not convinced of this, in part because of my statement immediately above. However, I can't say that I've rebutted this, either... Not so fast. His morals were not the only factor in his designation as abnormal. If they were, then you might well be right. Let us also consider the evolutionary approach. In this respect, there is an ""internal"" morality that is shared by most that still allows for designation of abnormality. Generally, the more major issues are not disputed. Hardly anybody believes that outright stealing is ethical. There were no evolutionary implications of whether a fetus has rights. There were no evolutionary implication of the right to bear arms. Perhaps this is the reason there is so much dispute over these things and not others. In the case of Cho, one must realize that his view of morality caused him to take his own life, which in itself can be seen as abnormal. A damn good question. I don't know of any genetic research, but research on animal behavior shows inherent morality. Right, but my point is that I don't see any case where there's a necessary infiltration of an outside source as you're claiming. I think we've seen several instances on this very forum of twisted logic that is consistently twisted and illogical... Again, I agree. I generally find it a lot more productive, though, to address the vastly different viewpoints. I used to pitch in anytime I disagreed, but I'd rather address the terribly illogical posts rather than the ones that miss only a couple minor points. Depends, are they good ideas, or more just wishful thinking? Because I've got plenty of that, and even made a couple of requests, but nothing has come of them.","Steeeeve","301360","I have two points to this. (1) You still have to know what good or happy is (or understand the term) and (2) I don't think you want to say what makes you happy or feel good is the same as right and wrong do you? I would say it is on par with stealing goods but this is a little a little off subject. I think people get swayed by the fact that it is so common therefore it is not that bad. To put it in an extreme example, slavery was so common people thought it wasn't that bad. You rationalize your selfishness to make it ok in your mind. This is something that is hard to overcome. No, I should have clarified that point. Naturally I think that happens but a solid moral foundation allows one to give back incorrect change. This gets into reasons why we ought to have a moral system instead of whether or not one makes sense to have. I stand by my claim that one can be moral without believing in God. I just add that they have no reason to which can open the door to bad things. I think it is dependent because otherwise what would you have to share? This more or less strays from my point. A morality system based on yourself won't be justified in that there is no reason to act in those moral ways. Why would helping society be good? What reason do you have for being good? Those kinds of things can't be answered by having a morality system based on yourself. It basically implies you (yourself) are god yet this doesn't work because, once again, you really can't answer any of those basic questions (and there are more than listed). I'm not expert on evolutionary stuff but isn't the abnormality the first step into evolving to something new and becoming the norm? Furthermore, you get into questions about at what level is something abnormal (perhaps another moral question) and does this affect good and evil, right and wrong. Can one say that because homosexuals are a small portion of the population that they are abnormal and thus their moral system may be flawed? I don't know if we can judge morality based upon a society norm like that. Are they major issues because they are not disputed or not disputed because they are major issues? Whether blacks were equal to whites was a big morality issue at the time. Now it is not disputed. Are treating others equal not an evolutionary trait? I don't know if the evolutionary model can really hold up under these questions. Animals have morality? I think they have instincts but this seems to be different from morality. It wouldn't be necessary...just random, happened by mere whim like the dice. I kinda forgot what we are talking about with this though haha. True, I think conclusion based reasoning is the worst offender. People start with something like ""coke is better than pepsi"" and really work their way back to making that true. I also love the posts where you provide evidence of where your logic came from yet the responses back are ""no, I'm right and you are wrong"". Those people you just have to ignore. There are some posters I just don't read anything they write or in rare cases they are blocked. Seems to be the best way to deal with the increasing number of XXXXXX on this forum haha.

To address the concept of human rights as the concept has historically been applied - from victims of war, to slavery, to child or spouse abuse, etc. - I would think that one would need to look at the aspects which drive people to fight for human rights to begin with. The appeals I hear most often in that context are appeals for sympathy for the suffering of the victims of human rights abuse. This, then, can apply to late-term fetuses - which probably can suffer - but not to early term fetuses.","Steeeeve","301412","I haven't seen an overwhelming (or any so far) biologists saying that biological the embryo is not a human being. I grant that the definition really doesn't matter because you can change definitions but lets at least be realistic with what definitions already exist. No reason to change them for purposes of a debate. There is nothing I have seen to indicate I can't call the embryo a human being but there does seem to be indications that you can't call it not a human being. As for standards of rights, I simply deny the UN has any authority on the subject so I choose to ignore there random claims. They aren't almighty and until they are prepared to tell me those human rights came from more than thin air then I see no reason to listen. You know I disagree with this. Ways you appeal for human rights don't equate to why the human right exists in the first place.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","02:16 PM","abortion-debates","159"

Where biology is concerned, though I don't read biological journals or too many books relating to biology, the articles that I have read that are related to biology generally use more scientific terms than human being - where ""human being"" seems to be used far more in non-scientific situations than in scientific situations. Much more often, I here the simple term ""humans"". Either way, the important aspect of the word ""human being"" is how people generally use it in the context of human rights, which is why I brought up the UN. I think we might agree that there is no universally accepted definition of the term ""human being"" in that context of human rights, so we need to deal with individual arguements on this - not on appeals to authority or on universally accepted standards. They are the closest thing to an authority on the subject but I would agree that, just because an organization is an authority on a subject, that doesn't mean that they cannot be wrong. However, it does mean that you cannot claim that your definition is the universal definition.

If you don't aknowledge that, then you would really need to look at more dictionaries - multiple definitions are everywhere . If you do aknowledge it, then why do you think it is relevant to apply the definition of ""human being"" from the context of biology (where, even there, the definition is vague enough to be contentious) to the context of human rights? It just seems like a pointless exercise. Nevertheless, since the term ""human rights"" is most often used in the context of international relations, wars, and the treatment of governments of their people, I do think that the UN and other such international bodies do have some authority on the subject (at least more so than any other groups) that one can refer to as a global standard. However, even though that is the closest thing that we have as a standard when it comes to the usual use of the term human rights, I do not think that standards need to be fixed for all time. One can change standards by convincing people with arguements that appeal to reason and emotion. To be in the least bit convincing, any extention of human rights to zygotes or fetuses requires such arguements. You may claim your particular Christian religion as an authority but you know full well that it is not a universally aknowledged authority so you cannot claim it as such. The UN is far more universally aknowledged and far more quoted and referenced in its views on human rights than are religious institutions. The UN is the closest thing we have to a universally accepted authority but I agree that authorities are not always right. You often compare the lack of rights of zygotes and embryos to the earlier lack of rights for blacks. It just makes no sense to make that comparison if one doesn't analyze WHY blacks were deprived of rights and WHY they were eventually given rights - i.e. what arguements were used to give them rights.","Steeeeve","301547","Seems you missed the point. The point is that in no matter what context I use the term ""human being"" for, it is proper when referring to an embryo. I'm not the one that question the use of the term. You can be of that opinion I suppose but I find they have no authority. Human rights are discussed when being violated against. They are violated mostly by governments but you can have them violated by people. You can also discuss them as we were now...in a general sense. The argument requires a reason for having human rights in the first place. Then UN certainly hasn't established this. This is yet another reason they are not an authority on the subject. To add to this, you can't extend human rights without a reasoning for rights. Without that all you would have to say is ""they aren't included therefore they have no rights"". Do you have any evidence for this? Seems the Bible is quoted more times than a UN report. I say that its not close for one, universally accepted means nothing, and the UN had no authority to begin with. Comparisons are not meant to be all inclusive of events. I use blacks and others as examples to show we traditionally have been wrong every time we say a human being is not worthy of rights. Blacks were ""inferior people"" and with the unborn we just declare them not people. The reasons for making such declarations will always vary but it seems traditionally the reasons are only seen as ""wrong"" long after the fact....as in 20/20 hindsight.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","03:54 PM","abortion-debates","179"

Yes, but the great majority of the time that one hears the term ""human rights"" discussed IS in that international situations - i.e. what one group or country does to a certain group of people. The main use of words help determine their definitions. ""A reasoning for rights"" - that is the critical thing that I think needs to be addressed. I claim that a reasoning for rights that has been historically given is important in addressing a general reasoning for rights. Most of us have accepted the historical appeals for rights - those arguements appealed to our emotions of sympathy and our sense of fair play. What reason for rights would you give for rights of a zygote? Most of the times I hear of human rights is in the news. I'm not even sure if the Bible ever even mentions that term - I doubt it does. The UN is the closest thing we have to an international political union. Its power may depend on its member states, which certainly excercise a large degree of sovereignty, but there is no other global international organization that has similar power and authority (such as it is). What organization would you say has had a greater public say and influence on the international discussion about human rights? The thing is that your arguements about zygotes automatically deserving human rights sound just as arbitrary as if someone passionately claimed that unfertilized eggs automatically deserve human rights. The reasons for both are not sound. There are many good reasons why blacks deserved human rights. I just haven't heard any good arguements about why zygotes deserve human rights. Really, it would be far more productive if we discussed those reasons instead of discussing definitions. It could potentially be far more convincing.","Steeeeve","301625","You can use it in any context but that doesn't mean when used it means that. For example ""person"" in the constitution means something different than what person means in another context but if you use person when talking about the constitution you can use it in whatever context you want. I don't think it is the main area I hear it being discussed. I hear it more locally. We are looking at reasoning too different ways. You are looking at it as reasons for giving rights while I am looking at it as reasons for having rights in the first place. I understand how rights are argued for many times but this doesn't speak to why that right even exists. I think an appeal to sympathy is merely begging the question on the subject. One doesn't need to use the buzz word ""human rights"" to be talking about them. None. I say the UN has no authority on the matter. I don't believe human rights are developed by a group of people sitting in a big room. And are just as arbitrary as arguing for human rights for a child. This isn't a problem with the reasons but what you believe makes up a good reason for human rights. Naturally it is biased against the zygote because you think a certain mental state is a requirement for human rights. I disagree with this and thus the reasoning to me for a zygote having human rights is rather convincing. I think the mental state requirement is much more arbitrary than one that simply looks at a human being (for purposes we will assume my definition). Mental state varies from person to person and grows, normally, over time. As a human being you either are or are not one. There are no levels of being a human being. Talk to Dane and Lesz, I didn't bring up the definition question. I am merely defending my use of the word.

"02-14-2008","10837",14,"Another opinion","301693","When one stays within context, one can use the definition that is appropriate for that context. It is just not valid to automatically claim authority of a definition in one context to use that definition in another context. I'm not sure if you agree or disagree. So, I will ask - are you or are you not trying to apply the definition of ""human being"" as might be used in biology to the context of ""human rights""? If so, then that is what we are objecting to. If not, then please say so - it will go a long way in resolving this part of the discussion. By ""locally"", do you mean that, in your church, discussions are held about ""human rights"" on subjects other than what ethnic/political groups do to other groups? Otherwise, do you claim that ""human rights"" are discussed when it comes to more mundane local problems such as local murders, etc. (mundane only meaning that it does not happen on a larger scale)? Could you give examples or an explanation. I think it is a combination. I think that there are reasons for rights to exist that one can discuss. When a group is deprived of rights, one appeals to those reasons in order to win the rights that the group deserved to begin with. Where slavery was concerned, most of us would agree that they should have had those rights to begin with but they were unjustifiably taken away from them. I think that the problem was mainly wrong assumptions made about blacks - assumptions that they were incapable of governing themselves, that the Bible gave whites permission to enslave black men, etc. Mostly, it was convenient for white planters to have blacks as slaves so they easily let themselves be convinced of these bogus arguements, so that they could feel justified in their attempts at enslavement. I think that, if white planters would have dropped their interpretation of the Bible supporting slavery and would have accepted the reality that, in all but skin color, black men were the same as they were, then they would have had a very hard time justifying slavery. Where zygotes are concerned, the only comparison I can imagine is that those of us who follow Science don't see anything in the zygote (in what it is AT THAT MOMENT) that necessitates rights. Since you believe in a soul coming in at conception, then the zygote is more than just its potential for the future. In your view, it is ALREADY a person like you and me due to the existence of that soul. We disagree. Since you cannot prove the existence of the soul, then we will have to agree to disagree and continue to vote our opposing views. A child has the same range of emotions, thoughts, possibility to suffer as we all do, so we would support the rights of a child for the same reason that we want rights. It is the arguement of ""do unto others"" that is the basis of morality that most people have learned. The main difference between a child and adults is that children are far too inexperienced to survive in the world on their own, so they need supervision of adults. So, the rights that apply to adults conducting their own affairs (voting, holding property, etc.) don't apply to children. Pretty much all other rights do apply to children. The differences between adults and zygote are far greater. Indeed, the only differences between zygotes and unfertilized eggs are the second set of DNA (thus making a complete set) and the start of the growth process. Most of us would not look at either of those properties as justifying a life form going from no rights to rights so strong that they overcome rights of the mother to her own body. As I have posted in numerous threads, it is not the DEGREE of a mentality but the EXISTENCE itself of some mentality - i.e. there needs to be ""someone home"" in that body, not just a body itself. That someone might have negligible mental capabilities, but he/she has to exist mentally. Mental existence is just as binary a state as is the existence of a genetically unique human being which arises at conception. They may be attacking you on this for the same reason that I am questioning you. I think we are all assuming that you want to apply the definition of ""human being"", as it might be used in biology, to the term ""human rights"" and claim that, therefore, the authority of definitions means that one can authoritatively claim that human rights apply to zygotes. If this is not what you are trying to do, then please state that clearly and explicitly. It would go a long way toward resolving this part of the discussion.","Steeeeve","301734","At the time of the discussion I was having I was not discussing anything to do with human rights even though the subject was implied. This is not say I don't think human being can be used in a discussion of human rights while referring to a fetus as a human being. I mean a few things by it. I mean it in disputes between local/state government or even federal and the citizens or between two citizens or just between people discussing philosophy. My job requires me to be around universities a lot so many thats why. Once again an appeal doesn't focus on the reasons for the right. You argue that if they dropped their reasoning then they'd have no reasoning. This is obvious. I argue beyond this in that it wasn't a wrong reasoning for denying blacks but a wrong belief. Where does this soul thing keep coming from? I haven't mentioned a soul. I argue this: human => rights. Very simple. You see now that we are more crafty in how we deny human rights...instead of before where you kept an understanding of a word and made up things to remove them from that understanding we now just change the understanding. One can easily see this evolving to something like ""a person is really someone that generates worth for the world"" and so we start denying the elderly and the handicapped rights. Your UN doesn't claim there are different rights between child and adults, do you disagree with this view? Furthermore, the fact that a child has emotion and thought doesn't make the idea of those things being important any less arbitrary. Well I deny a right to your own body but that's beside the point. Furthermore, I disagree with your assessment. A fetus of 30wks is closer to a newborn than a newborn is to a 50yr old but I don't see why we should discriminate based on development. This is still arbitrary. ""someone home"" might mean the very first brain activity or it could be the concept of self awareness which develops after birth if I remember from a psychologist I spoke with on the subject (correct me if I'm wrong on that). You are discussing something entirely different from what they are. They simply disagree I can use term at all when referring to a fetus and I believe I can. You are talking human rights. I object that you question me on the subject when I merely am defending something I wrote a long time ago that had nothing to do with what you are discussing. I am ok with you talking about the rights thing but at least be fair about the matter I was discussing with another poster.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","02:55 PM","abortion-debates","197"

"02-18-2008","10837",15,"Another opinion","302304","The whole point was that the subject of human rights and abortion was, as you say, implied. If you had been having that discussion in a completely new forum (not 4forums.com where your views are known) that has nothing to do with abortion or human rights, then you probably would have had much less enthusiastic rebuttals of your arguements of embryos being called biologically human beings, since there would have been no assumed conotations carried with that word. Your arguements here of embryos being called human beings was obviously transparent - at least to me and I would be very surprised if had not been transparent to the others you were discussing this point with. Can you give some specific examples of more everyday situations in the US where ""human rights"" are discussed? It doesn't necessarily focus on that, but the appeals for rights in specific situations often mimic the original drive for rights that drove people to demand them and governments to eventually grant them. However, my guess is that it is not these people-demanded and government-granted rights that you had in mind but that you have in mind some automatically existing rights based on a global proclamation of rights - be they ""natural rights"" or a religious view of rights. I suspect that we may be getting back into the discussion territory of proclamations vs reasons, where I think that there were original reasons for people to have rights and you may think that there is a blanket statement that one can make about rights. There were discussions about ""natural rights"" among philosophers, which were then adapted by politicians supporting rights, but philosphers generally tried to defend their own views of ""natural rights"" with reasoning. I think that the only area where a proclamation of rights is not necessarily supported by reasons is in the realm of religion and suspect that this is where you are coming from in your ideas about rights. I argue that their reasoning was illogical and could have been disproven if even minor objective investigations would have been made - thus curtailing the slaveholders ability to use bogus arguements. Stepping back to your comparison between slavery and abortion in denying rights, what incorrect assumptions about embryos do you claim that pro-choice proponents make? Here, I am looking for something similar to my outline of the incorrect assumptions made by slaveholders about blacks. You didn't mention a soul here in this thread but eventually mentioned it in another thread when I had challenged you to note the main difference between a zygote and an unfertilized egg that is critical to you. Otherwise, your arguements mostly revolved around proclamations. As for your claim that we are changing the definition of the word human in human rights to suit our purpose, I would claim that this is what you are doing, not us. The only time I had heard the term ""human rights"" applied to embryos is by you. Though I haven't read the entire declaration of human rights, it mostly seems to address rights to protect people from cruel treatment. I don't think it really addresses property rights, rights of dependents, etc. So, though it might pertain to the rights of children from violence, slavery, etc., it will not address whether the child can have property rights to, say, its Sony Playstation ... Basically, the UN addresses ""human rights"" (where that term usually refers to the more basic of rights against cruel treatment) not ALL rights - most rights are up to the constitutent countries. It appeals to a common sense of empathy that most humans have. The existence of a sense of empathy in nearly all humans (except for psycopaths) makes it not arbitrary. Most of us were brought up with a morality that involved thinking about how our actions will effect others - where empathy played the main role in those moral decisions. For the core rights to life, I would not disccriminate against level of mental development but would discriminate based on whether there is any mind at all. I simply would not give rights to bodies. Recognizing that there is an ""I"" (which I understand is the concept of self-awareness) is different than being developed enough to experience everything that comes along with being an individual mentally existing being - the emotions and/or thoughts, the perception of pain or other senses, etc. Again, the importance I place on mind for having a right to life is not in a more highly developed mind but any mind to begin with. That mind doesn't have to recognize itself in order to exist. Most animals may not have self-awareness, but they have emotions, a sense of pain, etc. I was hoping to avoid that by jumping to the core of the arguement - i.e. can the term ""human rights"" be applied to embryos. Perhaps I am jumping to assumptions, but it seemed obvious to me that the arguements about whether the definition of ""human being"" in the biological realm includes embryos were never meant to stay only within the biological realm. It was and is clear to me that everybody saw the ultimate goal of that line of reasoning. So, it was important to me to point out the illogic of that line of reasoning instead of seeing this forum go back to long, pointless, unresolved debates about definitions.","Steeeeve","302319","Don't worry about my discussions with others, the two I am talking to do not care for honest debate and you trying to justify their position is not needed. These forums. I see no evidence that the reasons mimic the appeal. Reasoning only comes from proclamations. For example you can't reason that reason exists without actually violating reason. And I think you are wrong because you are already working from a different deck of cards. Hindsight can't be used when making an argument. That they are not deserving of human rights. I didn't mention in our discussion here and I am not aware of what you are referring to so please don't bring it up unless you have a reference that you are questioning. Of course, the definition has been changed for a long time. Again history has been against those that argue a human is not deserving of human rights. Aren't we talking about human rights? I'm ok with no granting an embryo the right to vote. So are their different levels of human rights now? That is still arbitrary because you never established a connection between empathy and morality where empathy is the reason for morality. brain waves begin rather early. Do you discriminate now? if that is self-awareness then I am pretty sure that develops after birth. This is what you care about...you have no idea what they are thinking or care to discuss. I don't mind you jumping in but don't take my use of words out of the context they were in. It was my goal too see how foolish some members of this forum are. It was clear there was not going to be an intelligent debate on the actual matters.

"02-19-2008","10837",17,"Another opinion","302459","What I meant by that question was for you to point out some examples of more everyday situations in the US that people have labelled human rights abuses. Since you don't seem to think that rights are based on reasons but are based on proclamations, then I am not surprised. I don't get what you mean by that. Can you elaborate? There were certainly enough people around at the time arguing for the rights of blacks and certainly enough capable blacks (Frederick Douglas, etc.), that the Southern Slaveholders already had some evidence before them of the illogic of their opinions. They ignored the opposing evidence and stuck to their views because they ""knew"" they were right. By the 19th century, analytic reasoning and critical thinking were common enough that the lack of its use by Southern plantation owners was purposeful. I can just as easily hypothetically claim that you are wrong in saying that unfertilized eggs are not deserving of human rights. When human rights have been violated, then the common theme has been suffering and, very often, illogic in the assumptions made about the people that were made to suffer. What would you claim is the incorrect assumptions (about the characteristics of zygotes) that we on the pro-choice side make? You yourself once spoke of different levels of rights - essentially legal rights vs natural rights. There are many rights - the right to vote, the right of free speech, rights which protect one from cruel treatment, rights to property, rights to sue for breech of contract, rights for a jury, ... The UN doesn't address ALL those rights. It can't. It is not a world government. It just tries to address the worst rights abuses - mainly, the extreme ones that most often happen in war or by bad regimes that are tagged ""human rights"". You and I disagree that there is an absolute moral code. My arguement about the key importance of empathy in morality comes from simple observation about how people are brought up. ""How would you like it if that were done to you?"" or other such sayings are extremely popular among parents teaching kids the reasons behind a rule (once they are old enough to be able to be convinced by reasons). ""Do unto others"" also requires a sense of empathy to place oneself in the others shoes to realize the concequences of your actions. Judging from other posts, you do not seem to understand that any random brain waves do not mean a mental existence or sentience. Late fetuses can feel pain - where it takes a rudimentary level of mind to register that pain. Early embryos can have reflex actions, but it is only later that they can register pain in the brain. Either way, my main goal was not to defend them but to try to prevent this forum from going into another set of weeks devoted to arguements about definitions.","Steeeeve","302486","I don't think that was what I was referring to (just human rights..not human rights abuses). But we talk about human rights abuses on these forums as well. Morality is based on proclamations because reason is not a basis but a method. Reason can only take you from A to B but can't actually be A. It is simple: Prove reason. You can't do it without first violating reason (begging the question). Because of this you proclaim reason to be reasonable and true. This is just one example of a very proclamations one must make before coming up with a morality. Like in my example above..the very fundamental level of morality would be A. You can prove A but you have to get from A to B so you assume A and assume reason to get to B. From there on out you are ok with using reason. And you can't say it is any different now with the issue of abortion. I guess you could claim I can't prove it to be the same either but I don't claim proof but merely opinion that I see strong parallels in arguments from the slave time to the current issue of abortion. Indeed you can. This is why I use the argument as a means to advance other arguments and not use it alone. For example if I say X is a human being and then use arguments about how mistreatment of human beings in the past has proven to be wrong then the argument works better. Doesn't have to be physically suffering. It is the fact that a human right has been violated that is the problem. Someone shot in the head doesn't exactly suffer but has still had a human rights violation. I told you, that they are not deserving of human rights. I am asking about human rights and whether or not those are different for different ages. I 100% agree that there are different kinds of rights. Yet with no absolute you can't say this is true with absolute authority. Your denial of an absolute (which ironical creates an absolute) would have to except a different morality stance. Again those are arguing not for the existence of rights by someone but a violation of rights already thought to exist with the other. So if A and B are assumed to have the same rights you argue empathy or whatever to say if A does something to B then you violate B's rights. Now this doesn't address why A or B should have rights in the first place. Right now we have a situation where A has rights and B is said to not have rights. You need to argue why B is worthy of rights. This is a subtle difference and harder to show because it gets back to a belief in my opinion. This wasn't the point. You said ""I would not disccriminate against level of mental development"" to which I point out that mental development could be said to be beginning with the first activity of the brain..no matter how fundamental. Brain waves begin at 6 weeks so do you mean something different when talking about mental development? You can see how other members of a forum can so easily change the frame of a debate and construe phrases to make it seem like I was saying something I was not. I made no claim of mental existence or sentience when posting about brain waves. Feeling pain is not a self-awareness but a reaction. I am interested on your stance regarding self-awareness as in the ""I exist"" idea. Oddly enough I have heard many folks argue that since self-awareness develops so much later that you should be able to terminate up to one year of age (or varying depending on who is talking to me). Then you need to be posting to the members who brought it up in the first place. It is unfair to press me on it and not the cause when you want an honest debate. I know you are an honest debater so I don't think anything of it but I thought you should know that it came across as biased.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","12:38 PM","abortion-debates","246"

On the one hand, if they really mean that neuronal activity is the gold standard for possession of human rights, then they haven't a leg to stand on with regard to abortion before six weeks. On the other, they really set themselves up for scientific refutation as to where to draw the line. If science ever decides when self-awareness emerges during foetal development (or even post-natal development!), then they won't have a leg to stand on to prevent abortion (or even infanticide) before then. It's a very poor basis for argument, and it's really counter-religious as well, trying to turn a religious opinion into a scientific. I have far greater respect for anti-abortionists who argue on the basis that all human life at any stage is sacred (though I don't entirely agree with that -- I think there are rational degrees of sacredness and not everyone is going to agree on them); or even better, that all animal life is sacred, and should not be arbitrarily destroyed.

"02-20-2008","10837",18,"Another opinion","302503","I am just wondering what types of rights you place under the general category of ""human rights"". The way I have heard the term ""human rights"" used in the news stories I have heard throughout my life has been to refer to basic rights from cruel treatment. Perhaps I was jumping to assumptions, but you seemed to imply that more everyday rights could be referred to as ""human rights"", which is why I was and am looking for SPECIFIC examples. But A doesn't need to be a proclamation, it can be an observation. Where morality is concerned, 'A"" can be an observation of human nature and how it reacts to various stimuli. For example, humans suffer when pain is inflicted on them. If groups are targeted for a particular characteristic, then most of those of the group will live their lives in fear. There are probably thousands of such larger-scale or smaller observations one can make, and one can use reason to analyze those observations. Furthermore, history has shown the consequences of various moral systems, so many systems have already been tried out. It is not an exact science, but a combination of observation of human nature combined with reason can get one far. On the opposite spectrum, proclamations, if they are not supported by reason, run the risk of being either unjust in most people's view, or ineffectual, or illogical... I am not against proclamations in general, just against proclamations that are not allowed the judgment of reason and comparison to reality. What do you mean by ""prove reason""? Reason is logic. One either has an illogical arguement or a logical arguement or a mixture of the two. Yes, reason has to start at some point and go from there but, as I said, reason can start from observation. But you haven't outlined the details of that parallel, which makes your argument very flimsy indeed. That is just playing with definitions. I can say randomly that unfertilized eggs are human beings since they are human and have the potential (as do zygotes) to grow into full humans. Well, there is the moment of pain of getting shot in the head, but a large part of the problem is the fear that is caused by random members of a particular group getting shot. People want to live and a threat of death causes suffering. You think human rights kick in at fertilization. I think human rights kick in at the start of mental existence. We simply chose different points at which to start human rights. My choice is based on the concept of ""I think, therefore I am"" - i.e. that it is not bodies alone that I value but people = bodies + mind (of any level). The brain controls both physical and mental processes. Just because a brain exists does not mean that mentality exists. The brain has to be developed enough to have some mental function - not just physical function. Until we have mental function, we do not mentally exist. It is those aspects of our existence which many religions attribute to a soul. Science has shown that much of that function, probably all of it (though I hope not), resides in the sufficiently developed brain. Then why did you bring up brain waves? Was it simply a non-sequitor? Many animals do not recognize themselves as separate entities in terms of having any concept of ""I"". So, they are not self aware. Nonetheless, they can have emotions, can have some rudimentary level of reasoning, can feel and register pain, etc. - i.e. they have some level of mind. Once again, a mind doesn't need to recognize its own existence to exist. Well, it takes two to tango. I would urge all of you (both you and your pro-choice opponents) to just agree to disagree when it comes to the definitions. My assumptions, which you have not yet refuted, is that your goal was to try to force that definition of human being and then use it to claim that human rights should apply to fetuses.","Steeeeve","302663","Those rights not dependent on anything are human rights. There probably aren't many but the main one is you have a right to be alive as a human. Observation uses a reasoning. If you make an observation you are answering questions and deciding things with that. You could claim an observation to be an 'A' (but not the first A) but you still proclaim reasoning to be true in order to make a decision about that observation. It would be like taking a picture and not looking at it (the observation) and then looking at it to make a decision (the reasoning). The picture alone with no reasoning does you no good. Observation is merely a tool and not a beginning point. They beg the question though. You can't prove reasoning by reasoning. Reasoning is a proclamation by itself. No it can't start from observation because you already have to have the ability to reason to make that observation mean anything. You can't prove reasoning to be true and therefore it is a proclamation. I never was asked too and we haven't had a forum topic on it in a long time. You play with definitions here. I assume in my example that human being is what it is. I didn't mention anything about what I was referring to other than human being. ""X"" in my example could be you and I if you want. I don't feel the need to argue the definition of every word in every argument. Not to the dead person. Now you get into the idea of society suffering and if that matters. Well, if society is ""suffering"" because they don't like the thought of abortion then is this reason to consider it wrong? So human rights are equal among all ages from the point you think they get them until the end? That is my question. I don't question your position I only question the statement you made and how it can be taken to mean something different. Mental development might be a bad choice of words. Because of what you said. You said you do not discriminate with regards to mental development. I brought up brain waves asking if that is a stage of mental development (which it could be said to be). You clarified that is not what you meant in the above paragraph (quote). So it isn't really self-awareness that matters. Am I understanding this correctly? No, it takes one person to start such a stupid argument and it takes two to continue it. I chose to continue it because I can get an idea of certain posters are thinking (or not thinking as the case may be). No, I refute this. It started when I spoke using the word ""baby"" to describe a human fetus. ""But you are ok with a woman deciding what is right for someone else's own body...specifically the babies?[sic]"" I wasn't forcing any term on anyone...merely using a term as one can.

They are too disorganized which, along with analysis of early brains, shows a lack of communication between brain cells that is needed for mental existence. Even late-term organized brain waves do not guarantee a mental existence but support the possibility that a mental existence might be there. It is mental existence that matters. Self-awareness, as I understand it, requires a mind to recognize itself. I do not require a mind to recognize itself in order to say it exists. So, yes, self-awareness doesn't matter to me for the basis of human rights. That is a more developed mental state (which still happens quite early). My main moral drive is the ""do unto others"" which is itself largely driven by empathy. I can empathize with a mind, whether or not it recognizes itself.

THE NEUROLOGY OF SELF-AWARENESS What is the self? How does the activity of neurons give rise to the sense of being a conscious human being? Even this most ancient of philosophical problems, I believe, will yield to the methods of empirical science. It now seems increasingly likely that the self is not a holistic property of the entire brain; it arises from the activity of specific sets of interlinked brain circuits. But we need to know which circuits are critically involved and what their functions might be. It is the ""turning inward"" aspect of the self its recursiveness that gives it its peculiar paradoxical quality.","Another opinion","302731","I think self-awareness goes beyond just having a mind.

On one hand we have what I call the self-model. Basically the self-model is how we mentally represent our selves, it contains information about what motivates us, as well as information such as how we might look to an outside observer. The other phenomena that is sometimes called self-consciousness is self-awareness. Self-awareness is much less abstract than the self-model. In the simplest possible terms self-awareness is the process by which perceptions and knowledge are felt as being part of us. When you are hungry you feel the need to get some food for yourself; it is self-awareness that is responsible for the knowledge that this feeling of hunger is our feeling and that we need to do something in order to satisfy it. ... Now let us turn to self-awareness. As I mentioned above self-awareness is closely tied to our perception of the external world and of our own internal mental states. It is not simply perception though; it contains the knowledge that these perceptions are mine, and not someone elses. Although I cant provide you with an objective explanation for the cause of self-awareness it is quite easy to demonstrate that it exists. Consider a man who has been for a long time without water. Let us allow that he has the perception of his thirst but no self-awareness of this perception. If we presented this man with a glass of water then he has no special reason to drink it. Yes, he perceives thirst, but if he doesnt realize that it is his thirst, so why should he be motivated to drink? Because situations such as this never actually arise we can be reasonably sure that we all possess self-awareness. Let me use an example to help distinguish this self-awareness from our self-model. My perception that I am sitting down is a good example of self-awareness. It is true that the more abstract information about this event, such as what it might look like to someone else is part of the self-model. However the direct perception of the feeling of sitting, and the knowledge that I am the one doing the sitting, is self-awareness. Thus, in contrast to the self-model, self-awareness is immediate and tied to perception. Before we answer the bigger question about the relationship between consciousness and self-consciousness lets look at the possibility of animals being self-conscious. It seems pretty clear to me that most animals lack a self-model or possess only a rudimentary one at best. For example a parakeet can be fooled by a mirror into thinking that it has a friend with it, so clearly it lacks a self-model that contains expectations of how the parakeet looks to an observer. Self-awareness however seems much more likely. If you think that animals are conscious in any way then it seems obvious that they must be self-aware, since they are motivated by their desires as much as we are. So are animals self-conscious? Yes and no.","Another opinion","302748","I think we might have a different understanding of the term ""self-aware"". I suppose that there are various levels of self-awareness and the fact that it seems to be used in different ways by different sources muddies the picture. On the highest level, ""self-awareness"" is used to denote some inner reflection about oneself - i.e. ""know thyself"" - which is clearly a higher level intellectual pursuit. At a lower level of use of the term self-awareness, most animals might exhibit self-awareness by recognizing the difference between another creature and themselves. If the other creature gets hurt, they themselves will not get hurt. They themselves cannot control the actions of the other creature, etc. At the lowest level definition of self-awareness, it seems to denote an understanding that the sensations one experiences belong to yourself. However, even at that level, a creature that is not self-aware could experience such sensations, but not recognize that they are the ones to whom those sensations belong and, therefore, do nothing about them. There is an interesting web-site speaking about this lowest level sense of self-awareness - http://onphilosophy.wordpress.com/2006/06/19/: This philosophical analysis suggests that creatures that have no self-awareness can indeed still get perceptions - i.e. can still feel pain, etc. They just will not make the mental step of realizing that the pain is theirs and they need to do something about it. Where morality is concerned, I think that, as long as there is that perception of pain beyond a simple reflex action, then the being deserves some rights to protect it from the pain. Indeed, as long as there is a mentality that is able to perceive, then I personally think that this means that there exists some level of human mind which, by its very existence, deserves some rights.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","05:53 PM","abortion-debates","265"

Sympathy or empathy , by its very definition, is (from the online Merriam-Webster dictionary, second definition) : the action of understanding, being aware of, being sensitive to, and vicariously experiencing the feelings, thoughts, and experience of another of either the past or present without having the feelings, thoughts, and experience fully communicated in an objectively explicit manner . Such a valid sense of empathy requires that the ""other"" have feelings, thoughts and experience, which, in turn, requires a mental existence. Otherwise, one is falsely attaching a personality to an object - as in the first definition of Empathy under Merriam Webster: the imaginative projection of a subjective state into an object so that the object appears to be infused with it - where the key point is ""imaginative"" - i.e. not real. I often find pro-life proponents engaging in exactly this second type of empathy. They imagine that, because the embryo is starting to look human, that it can suffer or that one can empathize with it. Some have even written imaginary letters from the unborn. This type of thinking is just imaginary and false.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","06:37 PM","abortion-debates","293"

I'm not going to quote everything and answer everything because it would take hours. As for when I stated the so called fact. That may be opinion, I was under the impression that when all the cells necessary to form a being were there that according to biology that is when life begins. This may have been anothers opinion. So according to biology I may not know when life actually begins. So call it opionion, it doesn't really change my view either way. As far as the blastocyst goes, it does have all the cells necessary to form into a completely functional adult human, that is why I see it as a human being. The sperm by itself and the egg by itself are not complete. A lump of ore does not make a car. That was just me trying to make a point. I love that we have free choice in the country and I don't want to take away freedom. I just have difficulty understanding why it is ok for a woman to choose to destroy another life. The fact that it is in her body and dependent on her is not enough to convince me that it should be ok. Thelmoose - to answer your question... In my opinion the only difference between the blastocyst and a 7 year old child is appearence and function. I really wish I could see the blastocyst as nothing more than a mass of cells. That would be easy. So for you pro-choicers... Does late term abortion seem to be ok with you? What about partial birth. I'm talking after they can feel pain and they have functioning brains?

Are you REALLY willing to do so, or do you think it is time to discard your contrived and artificial distinction here? It has a heart tube beat. there is no heart yet. Again, your attempt at misrepresentation is bothersome and evidencing that you are either dishonest or didn't bother educating yourself beyond the emotional imagery. Either way, when you make misrepresentations and mistakes like that, THAT becomes the issue of the posts, instead of the subject you originally raised. If you want to discuss the issues, I recommend you know enough to make intelligent and accurate posts about it instead of inaccuracies we then get bogged down talking about. Fascinating. How do you define ""brain,"" and do you have any idea what the meaning of what you just said actually is? Your sloppy research is not my problem. Again, go actually educate yourself so at least there is no debate about what the facts are. because otherwise, your incorrect ""research"" becomes the subject instead. But hey, if you want to detract from a discussion about abortion by making it into a discussion about pro-life inaccuracies, exaggerations, misrepresentations and expressed falsehoods, go right on ahead continuing your emotional histrionics. At 6 weeks, it is an embryo, not a fetus. We are talking REALLY BASIC stuff here, so could you please educate yourself a bit more about this issue. That aside, a response does NOT mean consciousness. You can kill me and still have my leg respond to reflex stimulation. Does that mean my leg would be an independent living entity even after I am dead? I recommend you educating yourself about what a reflex is. It does NOT involve actually feeling something or have awareness of a stimulus. So an embryo or fetus ""responding"" doesn't mean that there is any sensation of pain. All sensation is processed in the brain's cortex. And I gave several links previous, showing that the connection from the sensory/peripheral nervous system to the brain's cortex is not hooked up until about the end of the 26th week of pregnancy (ie end of the 24th week of fetal age). So I recommend you NOT further persist in the pro-life lie about fetuses and pain sensation at 6 weeks or even 12-15 weeks. Check my links if you at all care to educate yourself about this issue. And I also recommend you NOT get your scientific/medical information from pro-life lie-sites that owe their existence to scare mongering lies in order to get donations and disciples for their ""cause."" A cause build on such lies is not much of a cause. See post 302 again: http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...&postcount=302 Yes, it is emotional histrionics by pro-life lie-sites in order to push emotional imagery to make you forget that they have no actual facts and are lying. I am %$#@$#@%$ sick of pro-life liars and I am saddened that you bought right into it. That would be ""not."" Correct terminology does matter. certainly. Now, if you want to discuss the procedure rather than pro-life lies, that's fine with me. But at least show enough respect for us to educate yourself about it and actually know what you are talking about. It is pointless to discuss pro-life strawman arguments. Why? I hope you are not deliberately misrepresenting how I defined labor, right? After all, if the 3 stages of labor occurred, then birth occurred. It has nothing to do with timing but rather about process. So why that silly remark. That was just MORE emotional histrionics. Please try to go with factual stuff instead, please. Who is anti-lifer? And it is more than different words, it is about misrepresentation and stark dishonesty. It is very hard to have a respectful discussion with an pro-lifer when that pro-lifer either deliberately or unwittingly posts falsehoods and lies (even if they are not your own lies). Absolutely. For not trying, you are doing a bang-up job at it with the emotional misrepresentations. How do you define ""human life""? Is an appendix a human life? Is the hydatidiform mole a human life since it is formed by the merging of a human sperm and a human egg? I tend to go with born, sensate, sentient persons over non-sensate, non-sentient tissue any day. I am sad that you do not. Sentience. But that even is not relevant. Nowhere else are we forcing people to give of their bodily resources against their will. Only when it comes to a non-sentient, non-sensate embryo or fetus do pro-lifers think it is OK to take such control away from the woman and enslaving her. To me it doesn't matter one bit how advanced the fetus is. All the pro-life arguments about development is utterly irrelevant and only serves as a source of discussions being derailed into the issue of pro-life dishonesty. The ONLY thing that matters is the woman's right to control her own bodily resources rather than being enslaved as a second-class citizen. That's the ONLY argument that matters to me. It doesn't matter if the fetus is Einstein, it doesn't have the right to use the woman's bodily resources against her will any more than a lung cancer tumor has the right to use your body against your will. Sure, no problem there. But then, it also is non-specific. Sperm is alive and are human cells, so they also are very young human lives. So that is just more attempt from pro-life of emotional histrionics and choosing words for emotional impact rather than factuality. It is lame and dishonest and lends you to accusations of dishonesty. Because it is incorrect and emotional histrionics and revisionist linguistic hyperbole. It is dishonest. ""Baby"" refers to a developmental stage that begins after birth. Why the dishonest need for emotional vocabulary. Is it because your argument doesn't stand on facts alone? From where I sit, that would be the ONLY reason for such insistence on inaccuracies and deception. Why? ""Child"" also is a stage beginning after birth. It will merely have me make remarks about your dishonesty. Again, if THAT is what you want the discussion to be about, have at it. But if you want a factual and honest discussion about abortions, then it requires YOU to be factual and honest as well. Your choice. From the end of week 8 to birth, that would be correct and accurate terminology, yes. In a discussion where pro-lifers insist on talking about developmental stages, such accuracy is vitally important. So yes, Fetus will work for me. Bothered? I have never stated that I am bothered by you viewing embryos and fetuses like that. I recommend you not try to portray me as being bothered by that. It is the pro-life insistence on inaccurate and misleading vocabulary that bothers me. I would say that is an accurate description of our differences. Because it is misleading, it is inaccurate, it is emotional histrionics. It is as silly and inaccurate as when I refer to you as an undead corpse. If you want a discussion based on emotional reactivity, then go ahead and use all those misleading, inaccurate terms, and you will end up with a discussion about pro-life vocabulary and level of honesty instead of a discussion about abortions. Which discussion is it you seek to have here? Yes, I can't stand dishonesty in debates. I can't stand misrepresentations. If you can not respect others enough to have an HONEST discussion with them, then no debate is feasible, only a fight about the level of the dishonesty in your arguments and terminology. So how is that working for you so far? have you had a lot of debate about abortions themselves so far? And when you are factually correct and point it out to me, I adjust to be factual as well. I expect you to show good faith and HONESTY and do the same. Do you love womens' freedom to control their own bodies instead of being enslaved to non-sensate, non-sentient tissue by theocrats?

"02-27-2008","10837",21,"Dane","303660","Ah, but you said cells, not chromosomes. I sure hope you know the difference. And if you go for chromosomes or germ-cells as defining of human life, then you also have to insist that a hydatidiform mole is human life and should be protected. Are you REALLY willing to do so, or do you think it is time to discard your contrived and artificial distinction here? It has a heart tube beat. there is no heart yet. Again, your attempt at misrepresentation is bothersome and evidencing that you are either dishonest or didn't bother educating yourself beyond the emotional imagery. Either way, when you make misrepresentations and mistakes like that, THAT becomes the issue of the posts, instead of the subject you originally raised. If you want to discuss the issues, I recommend you know enough to make intelligent and accurate posts about it instead of inaccuracies we then get bogged down talking about. Fascinating. How do you define ""brain,"" and do you have any idea what the meaning of what you just said actually is? Your sloppy research is not my problem. Again, go actually educate yourself so at least there is no debate about what the facts are. because otherwise, your incorrect ""research"" becomes the subject instead. But hey, if you want to detract from a discussion about abortion by making it into a discussion about pro-life inaccuracies, exaggerations, misrepresentations and expressed falsehoods, go right on ahead continuing your emotional histrionics. At 6 weeks, it is an embryo, not a fetus. We are talking REALLY BASIC stuff here, so could you please educate yourself a bit more about this issue. Yes, it is emotional histrionics by pro-life lie-sites in order to push emotional imagery to make you forget that they have no actual facts and are lying. I am %$#@$#@%$ sick of pro-life liars and I am saddened that you bought right into it. That would be ""not."" Correct terminology does matter. certainly. Now, if you want to discuss the procedure rather than pro-life lies, that's fine with me. But at least show enough respect for us to educate yourself about it and actually know what you are talking about. It is pointless to discuss pro-life strawman arguments. Why? I hope you are not deliberately misrepresenting how I defined labor, right? After all, if the 3 stages of labor occurred, then birth occurred. It has nothing to do with timing but rather about process. So why that silly remark. That was just MORE emotional histrionics. Please try to go with factual stuff instead, please. Who is anti-lifer? And it is more than different words, it is about misrepresentation and stark dishonesty. It is very hard to have a respectful discussion with an pro-lifer when that pro-lifer either deliberately or unwittingly posts falsehoods and lies (even if they are not your own lies). How do you define ""human life""? Is an appendix a human life? Is the hydatidiform mole a human life since it is formed by the merging of a human sperm and a human egg? I tend to go with born, sensate, sentient persons over non-sensate, non-sentient tissue any day. I am sad that you do not. Sentience. But that even is not relevant. Nowhere else are we forcing people to give of their bodily resources against their will. Only when it comes to a non-sentient, non-sensate embryo or fetus do pro-lifers think it is OK to take such control away from the woman and enslaving her. To me it doesn't matter one bit how advanced the fetus is. All the pro-life arguments about development is utterly irrelevant and only serves as a source of discussions being derailed into the issue of pro-life dishonesty. The ONLY thing that matters is the woman's right to control her own bodily resources rather than being enslaved as a second-class citizen. That's the ONLY argument that matters to me. It doesn't matter if the fetus is Einstein, it doesn't have the right to use the woman's bodily resources against her will any more than a lung cancer tumor has the right to use your body against your will. It is dishonest. ""Baby"" refers to a developmental stage that begins after birth. Why the dishonest need for emotional vocabulary. Is it because your argument doesn't stand on facts alone? From where I sit, that would be the ONLY reason for such insistence on inaccuracies and deception. Why? ""Child"" also is a stage beginning after birth. It will merely have me make remarks about your dishonesty. Yes, I can't stand dishonesty in debates. I can't stand misrepresentations. If you can not respect others enough to have an HONEST discussion with them, then no debate is feasible, only a fight about the level of the dishonesty in your arguments and terminology. So how is that working for you so far? have you had a lot of debate about abortions themselves so far? And when you are factually correct and point it out to me, I adjust to be factual as well. I expect you to show good faith and HONESTY and do the same. Do you love womens' freedom to control their own bodies instead of being enslaved to non-sensate, non-sentient tissue by theocrats? The mother? Ah, you mean the ""going-to-be-dead-corpse""?","preciouslife","303720","Stem cells from a tiny mole can not be used to create human parts because it is not human. The blastocyst has all the stemcells necessary to create all of the functional human parts. If you have issues with this then go to: ""I can't post liinks because my post count isn't high enough yet"" I'll say it again and again, a blastocyst has all the cells necessary to develop into a fully functional adult human life. After 21 days there is a heart beat at about 75-80 beats per minute. It pumps blood throughout the entire body. That's what the heart does, it pumps blood. Saying my research is incorrect and assuming I do not understand what I am talking about takes away from the heart of the debate.

Dane, this is getting rediculous. You keep attacking my words and my research and my education but you are having difficulties with simple words. You get angry when I call a fetus an unborn child! Look in the dictionary! Go to Merriam Websters online dictionary and look at the 1st definition of child. The unborn have always been properly referred to as children. Oh, wait... my wife had a scheduled cesarean where there was no labor! My children were never born. They're nothing more than a couple of fetuses running around! If you call me an anti-choicer then using the same logic, YOU would be an anti-lifer. When the sperm fertilizes the egg and the blastocyst is formed all the cells are present to form a fully functional adult human. So in my opinion, the blastocyst is a developing human life, just like a born child is still developing. Are mole cells not different than human cells? So you have just explained yourself. You feel that regardless of how advanced the fetus is, you feel the choice of the woman outweighs the childs right to life. That is where we will forever differ. To say one person has the right to choose over another persons life is sickening. So that brings me back to my original question for you Dane. Why is it not right to destroy a 2 month old childs life? It feeds off of mother and it feeds off of the money that dad and mom labor for. I understand your logic if you believe the part about being sentient is relevant. But you stated that it is not, so you feel the mother deserves more freedom than the unborn child. You believe it is ok to end ones life for the sake of convenience? So it's ok for an unborn child to be a second-class citizen? Taking away the womans right to destroy her child is not about taking away her choice. It is about giving the child the freedom and the right to life that it so deserves. I will no longer use the word baby to refer to an unborn child. But your definition of child is wrong as stated before. Look in the dictionary. I don't like dishonesty either. But I've not been dishonest. I stand behind everything I've said. I don't debate often, I try to stick to facts. You are trying your best, or at least it would appear, to stray from the heart of the debate and pick at little things. I'm fine with woman or men or anyone have freedom to control their own bodies and anything they do so as long as it does not hurt another person.

He or she wanted to know why it is not OK to terminate the life of a 7 year old, but it would be OK to terminate the life of a blastocyst. I don't think that is a simple question, but it is a simplistic one. Unfortunately, this is a complex concern and sophomoric over-simplications such as this does nothing to help intelligent discussion. Some people consider we may treat these two entities differently. Why would that be? The amazingly obvious answer is because they are very different entities. Certainly they share some characteristics, but are they are not the same. Obviously not. That is why there is room for discussion on how one might treat these two entities differently. If you feel it is not right to terminate the life of a blastocyst because it has the potential to develop into a viable baby, fine. I see that as a valid point. I disagree, but I see the point. But to imply that the difference between the blastocyst and the grade schooler is so small that they are essentially the same is absurd. Calling this a ""simple question"" ignores some obvious facts. That is all I am trying to say. Lastly, using a moniker like precious life implies you think life is precious. The further implication is that others do not. I would guess there are some persons who do not consider life precious but I am not one of them.

And at that time, there is nothing but a pulsating tube that does not pump anything. Why do you persist in repeating that lie?

Include what a ""brain"" is and what the significance of your claim is (other than your already proven false claim of pain sensation). Have an HONEST discussion with factual information, and we have a chance. When you continue to make false claims, whether deliberately or from extreme ignorance, then there can be no honest discussion until that falsehood has been resolved. So are you saying that you got those falsehoods from somewhere other than the pro-life lie-sites? fascinating. What lies preceded the lie-sites? Not at all, I am merely disgusted with all pro-lifers' endless dishonesty and ignorance. So until they/you are honest, there is little other to do than expose that endless stream of lies and misrepresentations. Sure you are, I documented it. You denying what is documented is merely a strong indication that you are not honest. You referenced them and the fetal pron silliness they try to push. All of which have been documented circumspect to the point where even other pro-lifers find fault with your claim. The ridiculousness is you clinging to claims that have been proven false. So agree to be an undead corpse, ok whatever. If you have such a desperate need for your revisionist linguistics and emotional histrionics, then it is clear that you have no actual argument, only sophistry. Well, just for the heck of it, I checked ""fetus"": There was labor, actually. It is not my fault that you don't know what labor is. Actually not. You oppose women having the choice to have an abortion. I don't oppose life. Nope. There are some of the ones what can eventually divide and change into a person. And the blastocyst doesn't form until the 5th day. The initial cell is a ZYGOTE. Once again, you show extreme ignorance of even basic aspects of this issue. How can you expect us to take you serious with such severe ignorance? You essentially have no fact or knowledge, only emotional fervor. And how do you know whether it becomes an ""adult person"" or a hydatidiform mole? Or even that it actually implants rather than end up getting flushed into the sewer as rat food because it doesn't implant (as is the case with far the majority of the fertilized zygotes. And in my opinion, it is a mass of non-sentient, non-sensate cells. So what? Nope. How would you tell the difference? A cell with the same number of chromosomes and genes, human in origin, no different than that of the zygote? Nope. It outweighs an embryo's or a fetus ""right"" to use the woman's bodily resources against her will. I said nothing about children, your emotional histrionics none withstanding. Yes, we have a difference in OPINION. A position I do not hold, your blatant lie none withstanding. Or is that another one of your mistakes, one of those cases where you misrepresent an embryo as a ""person,"" desperately clinging to the sophistry of your revisionist linguistic hyperbole? Back to my original point: Sentience and sensation. And the woman has the choice to let it or not. No bodily resources involved there. Irrelevant claptrap. What matters is the woman's right to not be enslaved. To not be second-class citizens to the theocratic, misogynistic culture you promote, a culture of oppression and control of women. No, she deserves more freedom than the fetus or embryo. I fail to see the individual existence, the individuality qualifying the embryo or fetus as ""one."" Back to the emotional histrionics, you corpse, you. Fetuses and embryos, of course, are not citizens your misrepresentation and dishonest distortion none withstanding. But then, nobody talk about destroying children, your misrepresentation none withstanding. And once there is a child, after birth, that indeed is the case. A hollow promise, as there is nothing such as an unborn child. Your pathetic desire to use fudge terms to blur known and specific distinctions merely result in misrepresentations.

I am looking forward to your factual, honest discussion where we can deal with the subject rather than your emotionally-laden misrepresentations. I want to discuss the subject, but not based on misrepresentations and revisionist linguistics. If you want to discuss facts, then you would use factual terminology rather than trying for emotional platitudes and emotional histrionics. But then, an embryo or a fetus are not persons. Rather, that life being an embryo or a fetus, your lame sophistry none withstanding. But yes, the embryo or fetus does die as it is dependent on the woman's bodily resources.

Now, given that you now know what a hydatidiform mole is, how does that tie in with your claim of what a human life or a person is?? So? Your use is deceitful and dishonest. The question here is whether you want an honest decision or merely an exercise in how good you are at sophistry. Are you honest or merely here to rant, THAT is the question. Yes. As long as you chose to use fudge terminology, revisionist linguistics and emotional hyperbole, THAT ends up being the subject of the discussion. Now, if you would rather have a factual discussion about abortion, that would certainly be much more productive. So far you have not given any inclination that such is your goal here. Well, then we can certainly have an honest discussion about that. If you are up for an honest discussion rather than sophistry. And I have factual evidence on my side. ""Person"" is a legal term based on the US Constitution. And it is clear per legal rulings that ""person"" does not apply to the unborn at any stage. It is only about words and terminology if you so chose per dishonest hyperbole and sophistry. THAT choice is yours. And you have that choice in a free country where the Government doesn't control your body and your soul. Isn't that nice? Nope. I believe that ""life"" that is not sentient does not control life that is. Ah, finishing with a dishonest attribution of others intent. yeah, clear evidence that you are not interested in honest and factual discussion. You can stuff your ad hominem dishonest fundie misogynist. It is human life, it is not ""a"" human life as in an individual. OK, my final word about you is that you are starkly dishonest and base your argument on deception and sophistry. People like you are not worth discussion much of anything with. Until you can be honest, there is no honest discussion possible with you.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","10:44 PM","abortion-debates","324"

Thank you for responding with a thoughtful answer instead of criticizing my every word. I actually see things a little differently now. It goes along the same lines as freedom of expression. A pro-abort might despise pictures of aborted fetuses posted in public places, but to try to prevent such things is taking away that of free speech/expression. For the pro-abort it is about choice and the freedom thereof. For the Pro-life (like myself) it is about life and the freedom to live it. It is extremely difficult to be pro-life in this world. I just wish that pro-aborts would understand that the majority of pro-lifers don't want to take away a womans freedom so much as we want to save what we believe is a life. I don't think the majority of pro-aborts understand how difficult it is for us to see so many lives being destroyed (what we believe is a life). It makes things like 9/11 and the ""war on terror"" seem so minute. It's sad that several thousand of our soldiers have died and it's sad that many other innocent people have lost their lives, but as a pro-lifer, thousands of lives are destroyed daily. It may seem foolish to a pro-abort, and if that is the case then so be it. The only way I can find peace is in my faith as a Christian. God knows what is true and just and he knows our hearts also. By the blood of Christ we can have eternal life. I believe the unborn will be saved. It is not my job to judge a person. God is the only judge. I can truly say that I hope I am wrong on my views of abortion. But, no matter, in the end we will all see things for how they are.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","01:47 AM","abortion-debates","325"
