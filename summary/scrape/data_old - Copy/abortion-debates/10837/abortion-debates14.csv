"02-14-2008","10837",14,"lesz","301698","No dear, I'm just pointing out to you that a personal opinion is not a scientific fact. Don't you get that yet? What does it take to penetrate? Look, Steve, i realise you aren't a biologist, so you get lost in scientific terminology and concepts. But yes, a cell is one of the fundamental units of biological organisation. It is an entity, and many human cells these days can be cultured in vitro, for longer or shorter times. A cell is a basic biological entity. And science is on the brink of being able to make almost any cell pluripotent, or capable of turning into other cells, perhaps even into growing into a new human being. So while you accuse me of lying, the fact is i know my biology, and you don't. Your accusations are worthless. Because science backs me up. Try a library -- you know... one of those big buildings with lots of books. Any definition of a human being with human rights I've come across that made sense included the notion of sentience. That is why Terri Schiavo's life-supported carcass was no longer a human being -- it didn't have a functioning brain to pilot it any more. But religious zealots weren't educated enough to figure this one out. Try understanding what I wrote. So far, you absolutely refuse. Sweetie, you have resolutely refused to understand what I've been saying. No surprise there, you aren't a reasoning person. You are a religious believer instead. I've argued that human rights develop along with physiological development. An ovum or sperm has fewer rights than a zygote, which has fewer rights than an embryo, which has fewer rights than a foetus, which has fewer rights than a prenatal baby, which has fewer rights than a post-natal baby, which has fewer rights than a child... etc., etc. Rights accumulate with development and growing sentience. I realise you cannot accept this because of your religious dogma, but don't expect me to take your unthinking dismissal seriously. You are arguing from ignorance. Well, the so-called soul is the seat of your religious objection to abortion. Where is the evidence there is such a thing?","Steeeeve","301727","Saying people in Alabama are stupid is pointing out that a personal opinion is not a scientific fact? I'll just default to what a real biologist said: ""Human being designates an organism that belongs to the species Homo sapiens. By ""organism"" I mean a cell or group of cells with interdependent parts that can exist autonomously in its environment"". I never accused you of lying... I accused you of being wrong. And you are. Also seems you know nothing about biology or at least have no references to back up anything you say. Hasn't so far. In fact, you haven't provided any evidence for anything you have said. I don't even doubt you can find it...but you haven't. Perhaps the one needing a library isn't me. Well prove that most people think this way like you claimed and stop wasting our time with your bigoted views of religion. I did which is why I called you on twisting your own words. You claimed most people think a human being has to be sentient. Show this to be true. Furthermore, show when ""fully functional brain"" is established. Interesting, can we remove rights for those with lower IQs? Do I get more rights for being college educated? What about with a graduate degree or PhD? Do I get more rights for those? Your argument makes no sense and even counters the UN human rights argument which is by far one of the worst. I realize you hate religion but do you really have to bring it up in every post you have? I never brought up anything about a soul. What is the term when you pre-judge someone and assume things about them without ever investigating....you know, where you hate something with no real evidence. There has to be a term for that...","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","02:34 PM","abortion-debates","196"
"02-14-2008","10837",14,"Another opinion","301693","When one stays within context, one can use the definition that is appropriate for that context. It is just not valid to automatically claim authority of a definition in one context to use that definition in another context. I'm not sure if you agree or disagree. So, I will ask - are you or are you not trying to apply the definition of ""human being"" as might be used in biology to the context of ""human rights""? If so, then that is what we are objecting to. If not, then please say so - it will go a long way in resolving this part of the discussion. By ""locally"", do you mean that, in your church, discussions are held about ""human rights"" on subjects other than what ethnic/political groups do to other groups? Otherwise, do you claim that ""human rights"" are discussed when it comes to more mundane local problems such as local murders, etc. (mundane only meaning that it does not happen on a larger scale)? Could you give examples or an explanation. I think it is a combination. I think that there are reasons for rights to exist that one can discuss. When a group is deprived of rights, one appeals to those reasons in order to win the rights that the group deserved to begin with. Where slavery was concerned, most of us would agree that they should have had those rights to begin with but they were unjustifiably taken away from them. I think that the problem was mainly wrong assumptions made about blacks - assumptions that they were incapable of governing themselves, that the Bible gave whites permission to enslave black men, etc. Mostly, it was convenient for white planters to have blacks as slaves so they easily let themselves be convinced of these bogus arguements, so that they could feel justified in their attempts at enslavement. I think that, if white planters would have dropped their interpretation of the Bible supporting slavery and would have accepted the reality that, in all but skin color, black men were the same as they were, then they would have had a very hard time justifying slavery. Where zygotes are concerned, the only comparison I can imagine is that those of us who follow Science don't see anything in the zygote (in what it is AT THAT MOMENT) that necessitates rights. Since you believe in a soul coming in at conception, then the zygote is more than just its potential for the future. In your view, it is ALREADY a person like you and me due to the existence of that soul. We disagree. Since you cannot prove the existence of the soul, then we will have to agree to disagree and continue to vote our opposing views. A child has the same range of emotions, thoughts, possibility to suffer as we all do, so we would support the rights of a child for the same reason that we want rights. It is the arguement of ""do unto others"" that is the basis of morality that most people have learned. The main difference between a child and adults is that children are far too inexperienced to survive in the world on their own, so they need supervision of adults. So, the rights that apply to adults conducting their own affairs (voting, holding property, etc.) don't apply to children. Pretty much all other rights do apply to children. The differences between adults and zygote are far greater. Indeed, the only differences between zygotes and unfertilized eggs are the second set of DNA (thus making a complete set) and the start of the growth process. Most of us would not look at either of those properties as justifying a life form going from no rights to rights so strong that they overcome rights of the mother to her own body. As I have posted in numerous threads, it is not the DEGREE of a mentality but the EXISTENCE itself of some mentality - i.e. there needs to be ""someone home"" in that body, not just a body itself. That someone might have negligible mental capabilities, but he/she has to exist mentally. Mental existence is just as binary a state as is the existence of a genetically unique human being which arises at conception. They may be attacking you on this for the same reason that I am questioning you. I think we are all assuming that you want to apply the definition of ""human being"", as it might be used in biology, to the term ""human rights"" and claim that, therefore, the authority of definitions means that one can authoritatively claim that human rights apply to zygotes. If this is not what you are trying to do, then please state that clearly and explicitly. It would go a long way toward resolving this part of the discussion.","Steeeeve","301734","At the time of the discussion I was having I was not discussing anything to do with human rights even though the subject was implied. This is not say I don't think human being can be used in a discussion of human rights while referring to a fetus as a human being. I mean a few things by it. I mean it in disputes between local/state government or even federal and the citizens or between two citizens or just between people discussing philosophy. My job requires me to be around universities a lot so many thats why. Once again an appeal doesn't focus on the reasons for the right. You argue that if they dropped their reasoning then they'd have no reasoning. This is obvious. I argue beyond this in that it wasn't a wrong reasoning for denying blacks but a wrong belief. Where does this soul thing keep coming from? I haven't mentioned a soul. I argue this: human => rights. Very simple. You see now that we are more crafty in how we deny human rights...instead of before where you kept an understanding of a word and made up things to remove them from that understanding we now just change the understanding. One can easily see this evolving to something like ""a person is really someone that generates worth for the world"" and so we start denying the elderly and the handicapped rights. Your UN doesn't claim there are different rights between child and adults, do you disagree with this view? Furthermore, the fact that a child has emotion and thought doesn't make the idea of those things being important any less arbitrary. Well I deny a right to your own body but that's beside the point. Furthermore, I disagree with your assessment. A fetus of 30wks is closer to a newborn than a newborn is to a 50yr old but I don't see why we should discriminate based on development. This is still arbitrary. ""someone home"" might mean the very first brain activity or it could be the concept of self awareness which develops after birth if I remember from a psychologist I spoke with on the subject (correct me if I'm wrong on that). You are discussing something entirely different from what they are. They simply disagree I can use term at all when referring to a fetus and I believe I can. You are talking human rights. I object that you question me on the subject when I merely am defending something I wrote a long time ago that had nothing to do with what you are discussing. I am ok with you talking about the rights thing but at least be fair about the matter I was discussing with another poster.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","02:55 PM","abortion-debates","197"

You aren't sure ""aren't a resident of Alabama""? Do you mean you aren't sure I'm not a resident of Alabama? Well to settle your fears, I am a resident of Virginia which is well known on these forums. If nothing you say contradicts science then surely you will be able to provide evidence for your claims. You have yet to do so in any debate we have ever had. This doesn't make any sense. Most religious people think sentient is a requirement for being a human being? I suppose you should prove that as well a long with proving that most people agree with you. Show you someone?...Ok, that biologist from Alabama that you love. Then what do you mean by awareness which is what sentience basically is? Self awareness? If self-awareness then in what aspect? Well at least you admit to hating religion...
