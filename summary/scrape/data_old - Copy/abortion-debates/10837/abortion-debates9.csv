LOL Now I couldn't help noticing how cowardly you avoided dealing with the issues in my post per you being out of arguments. So I accept your surrender on these points","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","09:48 PM","abortion-debates","121"
"02-08-2008","10837",9,"Steeeeve","300847","I don't know much about acorns and oak trees and I wasn't addressing you anyway.","Dane","300900","But I was specifically asking you if an acorn is an entity, based on your definition. Funny how you decided that you couldn't answer.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","09:49 PM","abortion-debates","122"

So what you are saying, in effect, is that an anti-abortionist is a person who can't tell the difference between an oak and acorn, or a chicken and an egg?","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","02:18 AM","abortion-debates","123"

I go on to say I wasn't addressing you so if you wish to ask me a question do so in the proper way.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","09:41 AM","abortion-debates","124"

I could be wrong because I don't know much about them but the mole is just the growth around the embryo as part of the placenta so it wouldn't match the definition I gave.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","12:39 AM","abortion-debates","134"

Humanity is something you grow into, or become, not a category that is created at the moment of conception. If a zygote is a human being, then so is an egg or a sperm, or a liver cell. They all fit your definition. I can see the next campaign slogan now: Save the Spermatozoan Americans! They even have a battle song for it already: ""Every sperm is sacred, every sperm is great. If a sperm gets wasted, god gets quite irate."" Very moving.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","05:54 AM","abortion-debates","135"
