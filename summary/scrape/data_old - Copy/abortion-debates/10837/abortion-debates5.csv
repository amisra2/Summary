But it would be so vaguely worded that it would criminalize masturbation since every sperm has the potential to become a child. I still believe it, but I'm gonna use a different argument. I wonder how many men are really in support of a ban on abortion. How many of you scumbags that have some side-whore that you f**k when the wife isn't looking or not in the mood, would be in favor of a law that would make it impossible for your side-whore to have an abortion if you got her pregnant? That'd be lovely for you wouldn't it, having to support two families now.","lesz","300120","*blink* You know, there are lots of us men on your side here. I'm all in favour of men being held partially responsible for any children they father, in wedlock or out. I am also in favour of any legal decisions on an abortion being solely the right of the pregnant woman. Of course, in the interests of full disclosure, I am also gay and long in the tooth, so the realistic chances of my fathering anyone even accidentally are impossibly remote.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","06:25 AM","abortion-debates","61"
"02-04-2008","10837",5,"electrolyte","300111","As long as we clarify that the word ""baby"" in these cases refers to a fetus, then I don't care. But in this context, I think we should be as clear as necessary. If the discussion is about the difference or lack thereof between a fetus and a borne offspring, then don't use the same damn word for each. Even if I'm arguing that five is the same as schmive, calling them both ""five"" just makes it impossible to follow the discussion. How is this not a fallacious appeal to authority?","Steeeeve","300139","It refers to what it refers to. I don't think you can easily take it out of context. I don't go around thinking you refer to a dog fetus when you say fetus. The context is known by simple reading comprehension. It is apparently clear everyone knows what I am talking about. No confusion was shown. born and unborn work just as well. There hasn't been a problem yet. Seems saying one or the other is more qualified would be an appeal to authority. Moral decisions are decided by a certain group of people unless you can establish an absolute moral right that only they know. I guess the better question is how IS that an appeal to authority.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","10:02 AM","abortion-debates","62"
"02-04-2008","10837",5,"Dane","300115","No, because the law says so. read the Roe vs Wade decision, it clearly and unambiguously states that the fetus is not a person. Now, you can continue to lie or espouse wild fantasies (depending on how ignorant vs dishonest you are about this claim. but the law is clear. A fetus or an embryo is NOT a person. Given that we now have seen you spew the same lies time after time, we already know what lies you are going to push , so strictly speaking we don't need you, no. We already know what lies you would be using . Because I don't agree with your misrepresentation of Constitutional law? What nonsense. there was never a time when black people were not people. Any other lies you want to spew (Rhetorical question, of course there are). Nope, that's another of your lies. Please document your lie. (And no, the dred scott decision that pro-life liars like to drag out for this argument doesn't say such a thing so you better have some other source). Never claimed any species identity, liar. Nope, because constitutional law says so, your endless lies none withstanding. Nope, your deceitful strawman none withstanding.","Steeeeve","300144","So if the law says someone is not a person then they are not? I won't even go into the fact that Roe vs Wade was gutted by the Casey decision. ""Liar liar pants on fire."" Do you like repeating yourself in a sentence (see underline)? You haven't shown you know anything about the constitution yet and it is pretty obvious But the law said they weren't (in the 1800s)! Isn't this the criteria you use? Are you going to start saying I'm not a person? Really? This one is not even that disputed on these forums. It is hard to argue that the fetus or embryo are not a member of the species homo sapien. A little extreme on your part. You don't need to look at just Dred Scott but since you brought it up that is a great example (another example could be the constitution itself). Dred Scott said blacks were ""property"" and had no citizen rights in the constitution. ""regarded as beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race either in social or political relations, and so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect, and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit."" How could you not see that as anything other than devaluing human life? Really? So a fetus in a dog is no different than a fetus from a human? A human fetus is by its very definition part of the species homo sapien. In fact, when you started claiming ""parasite"" you naturally assume a different species (parasite defined as one species living off another). So I ask you again what species a human fetus is? So if constitutional law said a fetus and embryo is a human and abortion is illegal then you'd say this is true? The courts called them property before...why don't you? Were blacks ever just property and were blacks ever inferior like the courts said?","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","10:35 AM","abortion-debates","63"

A fetus isn't an individual until it's fully developed and born and able to survive without the direct and constant life support of the mother. I don't care if the fetus is living and growing, it's not fully developed human. Until it's fully born the fetus is of the same status of living being that a dog or a cat might be; living but that's it. And we have no laws against putting down pets that can't live healthy lives.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","12:37 PM","abortion-debates","68"

What you are saying is that you don't like how individual is defined so you wish to change it to make yourself feel better. A born baby can't even survive on its own so why can't we kill born babies?

[quote]But it didn't override Section IX of the Roe vs Wade decision. So your claim of fetal personhood remains an outright lie. The law stated no such thing. Please provide documentation for you lie. Really? How is a member of a species defined? You don't know? Then perhaps your claim is a bit premature and based on ignorance, eh!!! Exactly, Dred Scott was a decision about citizenship, not personhood like you falsely claimed. I never said it didn't, your lie none withstanding. Your claim was about being a person. Clearly the Dred Scott decision did NOT claim slaves and African-Americans not to be persons. So your claim is false. Nope, I didn't claim that either. Again, please explain how a species member is defined. I never said ANYTHING about a parasite. But since you are on that topic, certainly the fetus carries out a PARASITIC FUNCTION in the woman. You can not deny that and be honest. What does that have to do with anything? the issue was the word ""person."" I can only assume that your evasive rhetorics and revisionist linguistics is an attempt at not admitting that you were wrong. Your surrender is accepted. Huh?
