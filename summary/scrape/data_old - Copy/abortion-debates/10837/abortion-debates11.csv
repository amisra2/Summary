Second, unlike you, I AM a biologist and your pet scientist's definition is obviously contrived to fit anti-abortion propaganda. It has no basis in biology whatever. Indeed, it is not a scientific definition at all. A human embryo is no more a human being than a cat embryo is a cat. REAL biologists can tell the difference between embryos and mature animals, and see no need to ignore enormous distinctions to suit some cockamamie religious agenda.","Steeeeve","301348","So you have no evidence you just choose to stick your head in the sand. At least you are consistent.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","08:28 AM","abortion-debates","151"

So a tumor now is an entity. Hmm....","Steeeeve","301349","I'm saying I highly doubt you know what you are talking about and since you can't seem to give me an understanding of hydatidiform mole that is consistent with what I have recently read then I have no way to address your questions.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","08:30 AM","abortion-debates","152"
"02-12-2008","10837",11,"electrolyte","301314","One doesn't need to be taught what makes him or her happy or feel good. I agree that this is sometimes true, but I would consider copyright infringement much more trivial than murder or stealing goods. For what it's worth, I no longer download copyrighted material. I can say that the exploration that I used to do caused me to buy more music than I otherwise would have. While this is not justification, I can honestly say that it (my personal actions only) cost the artists nothing (because I would not have bought their releases) and that it in a few cases increased their revenue because I bought albums. In fact, I'm looking for one now that I haven't been able to find yet... I have, on numerous occasions, given back incorrect change, and not because I was afraid of being ""caught"" or of being judged by a supreme being. Was this selfish and evil? This is not dependent upon a pre-existing set, only that whatever the set is, whenever its origin, it is shared. I'm not saying that people must get the morals from society. I'm still not convinced of this, in part because of my statement immediately above. However, I can't say that I've rebutted this, either... Not so fast. His morals were not the only factor in his designation as abnormal. If they were, then you might well be right. Let us also consider the evolutionary approach. In this respect, there is an ""internal"" morality that is shared by most that still allows for designation of abnormality. Generally, the more major issues are not disputed. Hardly anybody believes that outright stealing is ethical. There were no evolutionary implications of whether a fetus has rights. There were no evolutionary implication of the right to bear arms. Perhaps this is the reason there is so much dispute over these things and not others. In the case of Cho, one must realize that his view of morality caused him to take his own life, which in itself can be seen as abnormal. A damn good question. I don't know of any genetic research, but research on animal behavior shows inherent morality. Right, but my point is that I don't see any case where there's a necessary infiltration of an outside source as you're claiming. I think we've seen several instances on this very forum of twisted logic that is consistently twisted and illogical... Again, I agree. I generally find it a lot more productive, though, to address the vastly different viewpoints. I used to pitch in anytime I disagreed, but I'd rather address the terribly illogical posts rather than the ones that miss only a couple minor points. Depends, are they good ideas, or more just wishful thinking? Because I've got plenty of that, and even made a couple of requests, but nothing has come of them.","Steeeeve","301360","I have two points to this. (1) You still have to know what good or happy is (or understand the term) and (2) I don't think you want to say what makes you happy or feel good is the same as right and wrong do you? I would say it is on par with stealing goods but this is a little a little off subject. I think people get swayed by the fact that it is so common therefore it is not that bad. To put it in an extreme example, slavery was so common people thought it wasn't that bad. You rationalize your selfishness to make it ok in your mind. This is something that is hard to overcome. No, I should have clarified that point. Naturally I think that happens but a solid moral foundation allows one to give back incorrect change. This gets into reasons why we ought to have a moral system instead of whether or not one makes sense to have. I stand by my claim that one can be moral without believing in God. I just add that they have no reason to which can open the door to bad things. I think it is dependent because otherwise what would you have to share? This more or less strays from my point. A morality system based on yourself won't be justified in that there is no reason to act in those moral ways. Why would helping society be good? What reason do you have for being good? Those kinds of things can't be answered by having a morality system based on yourself. It basically implies you (yourself) are god yet this doesn't work because, once again, you really can't answer any of those basic questions (and there are more than listed). I'm not expert on evolutionary stuff but isn't the abnormality the first step into evolving to something new and becoming the norm? Furthermore, you get into questions about at what level is something abnormal (perhaps another moral question) and does this affect good and evil, right and wrong. Can one say that because homosexuals are a small portion of the population that they are abnormal and thus their moral system may be flawed? I don't know if we can judge morality based upon a society norm like that. Are they major issues because they are not disputed or not disputed because they are major issues? Whether blacks were equal to whites was a big morality issue at the time. Now it is not disputed. Are treating others equal not an evolutionary trait? I don't know if the evolutionary model can really hold up under these questions. Animals have morality? I think they have instincts but this seems to be different from morality. It wouldn't be necessary...just random, happened by mere whim like the dice. I kinda forgot what we are talking about with this though haha. True, I think conclusion based reasoning is the worst offender. People start with something like ""coke is better than pepsi"" and really work their way back to making that true. I also love the posts where you provide evidence of where your logic came from yet the responses back are ""no, I'm right and you are wrong"". Those people you just have to ignore. There are some posters I just don't read anything they write or in rare cases they are blocked. Seems to be the best way to deal with the increasing number of XXXXXX on this forum haha. Definitely wishful thinking but would be a good idea if it worked. At some point you just have to realize that we don't have an intelligence test or age limits to join these forums so we have to deal with certain kinds of folks.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","09:18 AM","abortion-debates","153"

I am a scientist, and I am just not impressed by whatever you seem to think is the epitome of science, because the arguments you offer are so poor. Alabama? I didn't know they could even read in that state. You seem to be arguing that as long as you define it as a human being, it is a human being, no matter that others don't share your definition. Bloody arrogant, if you ask me. And you appeal to some local yokel in Alabama. Just for your information, the definition of ""human being"" is not something anyone has ""evidence"" for. It's a relatively arbitrary classification -- one may be more reasonable than another, but none is subject to ""proof"". Your classification is one of convenience that suits your religious agenda. Mine is based on reason and includes sentience as a key component. This allows me to exclude embryos in the earlier stages of development, the brain dead on body life support machines, and various organs and separated cells. Being a human being, being a person, takes a lot more than just having the right DNA. It's got to be able to exist as a separate person. Biology just doesn't agree with you.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","09:27 AM","abortion-debates","154"

If you are a scientist then surely posting some informational sources won't be too much trouble. That happened to be the first one I found from a biologist. And your argument is that ""my definition is right and yours is wrong"". You go on to insult a state and once again another scientist (like you did in the global warming thread) instead of addressing the issue. You prove again that you have no interest in science but prefer insulting others that disagree with you. Your definition has no basis in anything since you can't provide any real evidence out there that your definition makes sense. But since your don't feel evidence is needed then at least provide reasoning for why your random definition is better than the one in the dictionary and the one used by many people. It also allows you to exclude new born babies if you wanted and include some species of monkeys. And now back to appealing to science when you claim it is an arbitrary definition just mere sentences ago. If you appeal to biology then provide some evidence for your claim.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","10:00 AM","abortion-debates","155"
"02-12-2008","10837",11,"Steeeeve","301264","Why does it have to be an organization? I think human rights are endowed by my Creator so the UN really has no say to me. In fact, I think they are wrong on human rights. The common set of human rights are going to be reflected in our laws but I don't think this means those what human rights mean. I think our laws should seek to reflect the outside standard of human rights.","Another opinion","301373","But that is the trouble. The UN is the closest thing we have to an international standard of human rights. Outside of that, there are various private organizations - such as Amnesty International, various churches, etc. - that set their own standard. Even if you go more local to the US, the standard that is applied depends on the party that is in the White House. If there is no one standard of human rights, one cannot start pretending that your standard is THE standard. One can try to make a case with arguements to logic or appeals to empathy and other emotions, but one cannot use definitions from one context and arbitrarily apply them to another context. That just does not work. Even in that original context of biology, it is clear that the definition of ""human being"" is far from universally accepted as applying to embryos. To address the concept of human rights as the concept has historically been applied - from victims of war, to slavery, to child or spouse abuse, etc. - I would think that one would need to look at the aspects which drive people to fight for human rights to begin with. The appeals I hear most often in that context are appeals for sympathy for the suffering of the victims of human rights abuse. This, then, can apply to late-term fetuses - which probably can suffer - but not to early term fetuses.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","10:32 AM","abortion-debates","156"

But I am not surprised you found it comforting, because it was designed to fit in with your religious prejudices. Sorry, but the definition is still ludicrous. You are the one in the invidious position of taking seriously a self-styled biologist who supposedly can't tell the difference between an embryo and a mature organism. It doesn't impress me at all, but i am not surprised it impresses you. Your standards for science are negligibly low. Sweetie, I don't know where this stupidity came from, but I am perfectly capable of distinguishing between monkeys and human beings, and between newborns and embryos. YOU are the one with a blind spot on the matter. Biology doesn't support your bizarre claim that there is nothing to distinguish an embryo from a mature, conscious, self-sufficient human being.

In fact, you still haven't come up with an reason or research to show your view...which wouldn't even be that hard since you claim to be a biologist and I assume you'd have access to many journals. So you dismiss a scientist because you don't like his or her stances. Shows that you don't really care about science again. You have yet to cite a journal that supports your beliefs. Is this how you conduct your science? You just say ""well, I disagree with that because my beliefs so the science is wrong and the scientists is an idiot"". The same thing you did in the global warming thread. Yet your definition doesn't support such a distinction...sweetie. You have yet to prove this or even show an example of this. Right now I have one journal citing of a biologist saying an embryo is a human being and you have your own opinion. I take fact over your opinion any day. I think you are just stalling why trying to find one source to prove your point. My sources are ridiculous because you don't like them? You can't attack the point so you attack the source.

I grant that the definition really doesn't matter because you can change definitions but lets at least be realistic with what definitions already exist. No reason to change them for purposes of a debate. There is nothing I have seen to indicate I can't call the embryo a human being but there does seem to be indications that you can't call it not a human being. As for standards of rights, I simply deny the UN has any authority on the subject so I choose to ignore there random claims. They aren't almighty and until they are prepared to tell me those human rights came from more than thin air then I see no reason to listen. You know I disagree with this. Ways you appeal for human rights don't equate to why the human right exists in the first place.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","02:16 PM","abortion-debates","159"

"02-13-2008","10837",11,"Another opinion","301423","Definitions exist, but since words can have multiple definitions depending on context, one needs to keep the context in mind. Where biology is concerned, though I don't read biological journals or too many books relating to biology, the articles that I have read that are related to biology generally use more scientific terms than human being - where ""human being"" seems to be used far more in non-scientific situations than in scientific situations. Much more often, I here the simple term ""humans"". Either way, the important aspect of the word ""human being"" is how people generally use it in the context of human rights, which is why I brought up the UN. I think we might agree that there is no universally accepted definition of the term ""human being"" in that context of human rights, so we need to deal with individual arguements on this - not on appeals to authority or on universally accepted standards. They are the closest thing to an authority on the subject but I would agree that, just because an organization is an authority on a subject, that doesn't mean that they cannot be wrong. However, it does mean that you cannot claim that your definition is the universal definition. However, ways that human rights were appealed to in the first place give an idea of how people in general view human rights. If you want to stray from that general interpretation, you need to present new appeals.","Steeeeve","301464","Then don't appeal to the UN. I think human being is used plenty of times in biology...from what I have seen but mainly in terms of species. Science isn't in the moral business so they don't have much reason to discuss the morality of abortion and defining human rights. I don't hear human being used in terms of human rights much...at least less now that we have some weird distinction between person and human. No they aren't and you yourself said appeals to authority are no good. They aren't the closest thing to an authority because they have no given authority to decide such things. They gave themselves this authority and you can't do that. I say they are not even an authority on the subject. My definition is of human beings...not human rights. No, how they appeal don't say how they view them. I don't understand this correlation.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","12:00 AM","abortion-debates","163"
