"02-13-2008","10837",12,"Steeeeve","301411","I find it comforting because I know you can't come up with a reasonable argument. In fact, you still haven't come up with an reason or research to show your view...which wouldn't even be that hard since you claim to be a biologist and I assume you'd have access to many journals. So you dismiss a scientist because you don't like his or her stances. Shows that you don't really care about science again. You have yet to cite a journal that supports your beliefs.","lesz","301496","Sweetums, scientists have better things to do with their time than write learned treatises on what constitutes a human being -- we leave that to philosophers and theocrats. Scientists have perfectly good scientific terms for describing the various stages of human development from sperm and egg through mature adult. We don't labour under your delusion that these are all equivalent persons. That is a legal or theological argument, and you can't appeal to science to settle it for you. Not that you would know how to appeal to science... Sweetums, you select some local yokel from Alabama who may or may not have a biology degree, and who has carefully contrived a definition of human being to include everything except what he wants to exclude. He doesn't use science to back up his preferred and idiosyncratic definition, and it isn't one most scientists would go along with. Science doesn't provide legal and theological definitions. But, since the local yokel puts out the propaganda you want to hear, you lap it up like mother's milk. Pathetic, Steve. You haven't a scientific leg to stand on, and it shows. Once again, scientists don't waste their time writing articles defining the term ""human being"". Quoting some ""right-to-lifer"" from Alabama isn't making a scientific argument. Steve, dear, what you are desperately grasping for is a scientific justification of your religious superstitions. You just aren't going to get one. It's a pity your knowledge of biology is so weak you get the wool pulled over your eyes so easily.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","10:00 AM","abortion-debates","170"

Quote us a scientific research article that shows a foetus is a person with the same range of awareness, feelings, emotions, thoughts and dreams as an adult person. That's what you need to do to convince rational people, but you won't, Steve, because you can't. There are no such articles in the scientific literature. Those are problems that concern theologians and philosophers, not scientists. There simply is no scientific support for your religious opinion.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","10:06 AM","abortion-debates","171"
"02-13-2008","10837",12,"Steeeeve","301464","Then don't appeal to the UN. I think human being is used plenty of times in biology...from what I have seen but mainly in terms of species. Science isn't in the moral business so they don't have much reason to discuss the morality of abortion and defining human rights. I don't hear human being used in terms of human rights much...at least less now that we have some weird distinction between person and human. No they aren't and you yourself said appeals to authority are no good. They aren't the closest thing to an authority because they have no given authority to decide such things. They gave themselves this authority and you can't do that. I say they are not even an authority on the subject. My definition is of human beings...not human rights. No, how they appeal don't say how they view them. I don't understand this correlation.","Another opinion","301498","Unless I have been misunderstanding you in these posts and discussions, you seem to want to use definitions of the term ""human being"" as used in the biological sphere and apply them to the idea of human rights. The only reason I can so you doing that is to claim authority of definitions themselves to apply human rights to zygotes. My main arguement is that I view such an approach as invalild since: 1) Definitions in one context may change for another context, which is why most dictionaries contain multiple definitions of words. You cannot just pick and chose them for your convenience. 2) In the context of human rights, there may be no one standard but the fact that the UN seemed to take birth as a standard is indicative of the fact that there was at least agreement at that high diplomatic level. That is not insignificant. The main discussions of human rights come into play on an international level - where, for ex., the US accusses North Korea or some other country of human rights abuses towards its people. If international spheres are the main spheres in which human rights is mentioned, then it makes sense that an international organization such as the UN should be taken as an authority. Do you propose another authority? If you deny any authority of the UN and you cannot propose another universally accepted authority, then you would have to admit that there is no authority on the subject and that any appeals to human rights would have to be done not to any imaginary standard of human rights but on a case by case basis. If that is the case, then why these games with definitions? What are you hoping to accomplish?

"02-13-2008","10837",12,"None","None","None","lesz","301499","Finally, Steve, let me point out to you that ""human being"" is not a recognised scientific taxonomical term. It's a colloquialism, for Christ's sakes. In biology, we refer to ourselves as ""humans"" or Homo sapiens , and sometimes as ""hominids"", ""apes"", ""primates"", ""mammals"", ""vertebrates"", ""chordates"" and ""eukaryotes"". A human egg or sperm is ""human""; a human zygote is ""human""; a human embryo, foetus or child is ""human"". So is a human liver. A ""human being"", however, is a colloquial term with no precise scientific meaning -- it has traditionally referred to any born member of the species Homo sapiens , and always one with self-conscious awareness. Now you want to extend the term colloquially to mean unborn humans as well, because that makes good propagandistic sense. It doesn't make scientific sense, however, because science already has its own nomenclature, which doesn't need your facile improvements: we have human embryo, human zygote; human blastula; human foetus, etc., etc. Stop trying to use science to advance your religious agenda, Steve. You can't make it work. It's a waste of your time.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","10:15 AM","abortion-debates","173"

He wants us to confuse the scientific term for our species, ""human"", with the colloquial term ""human being"", which is generally accorded various rights. (Which ironically enough, our Steve refuses to admit exist! For casuists like Steve, only unborn human beings have rights. Born ones mysteriously lose them.) Just because something is scientifically regarded as human tissue doesn't mean it should be automatically accorded full human rights we would give a sentient human being. But our Steve likes to confuse the issue. His thinking is fatally clouded by his religious beliefs.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","10:22 AM","abortion-debates","174"

Seems a little inconsistent. So you have nothing and you choose to insult scientists. This comes after you state that what scientists say doesn't matter. You are all over the place. This is the same bs you pulled in the global warming thread so I am not surprised. Quoting a scientific journal isn't a scientific argument? You are really stretching it here. And if it is the case that scientists don't ""waste their time"" then why are claiming what they think? You have shown no proof of this and it doesn't look like you will. The greater pity is not my knowledge of biology but the fact that you claim to be a scientist and yet just insult them when they disagree with your biased views. Once again you have no evidence for your claims and I do. This is nothing new from you. You have shown no evidence of this.

Then you can't say its wrong for your convenience either. The entire debate started because I called an embryo a human being...which is a correct use of the term. Doesn't matter if there are other definitons, point is that it is proper to use the term and to say it is not is wrong. Very insignificant actually. They have no authority on the subject and to say they do is no more than an appeal to authority fallacy. Indeed I do believe there is another authority on the subject but I don't think you will like it. The UN is not universally accepted for one and if it were then it still doesn't make it a source of human rights because acceptance of something doesn't make it true. If the UN felt blacks were inferior then I'd still claim this is wrong. As for the rest of the conclusion you draw, it doesn't follow from the reasoning you presented.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","12:34 PM","abortion-debates","176"

Would YOU as an individual be perfectly alright with some far removed politicians that're out of touch with the world, deciding for you what exactly is legal to do with your own body? Do you support giving your right to choose away to someone that'll make a choice for you even though it might not be the choice you want? Show of hands, who here is perfectly alright with the government being allowed to make all of your decisions for you, and telling you how you're going to live your life?","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","02:06 PM","abortion-debates","178"
"02-13-2008","10837",12,"Another opinion","301535","Do you or don't you aknowledge that words can have multiple definitions depending on the context? If you don't aknowledge that, then you would really need to look at more dictionaries - multiple definitions are everywhere . If you do aknowledge it, then why do you think it is relevant to apply the definition of ""human being"" from the context of biology (where, even there, the definition is vague enough to be contentious) to the context of human rights? It just seems like a pointless exercise. Nevertheless, since the term ""human rights"" is most often used in the context of international relations, wars, and the treatment of governments of their people, I do think that the UN and other such international bodies do have some authority on the subject (at least more so than any other groups) that one can refer to as a global standard. However, even though that is the closest thing that we have as a standard when it comes to the usual use of the term human rights, I do not think that standards need to be fixed for all time. One can change standards by convincing people with arguements that appeal to reason and emotion. To be in the least bit convincing, any extention of human rights to zygotes or fetuses requires such arguements. You may claim your particular Christian religion as an authority but you know full well that it is not a universally aknowledged authority so you cannot claim it as such. The UN is far more universally aknowledged and far more quoted and referenced in its views on human rights than are religious institutions. The UN is the closest thing we have to a universally accepted authority but I agree that authorities are not always right. You often compare the lack of rights of zygotes and embryos to the earlier lack of rights for blacks. It just makes no sense to make that comparison if one doesn't analyze WHY blacks were deprived of rights and WHY they were eventually given rights - i.e. what arguements were used to give them rights.","Steeeeve","301547","Seems you missed the point. The point is that in no matter what context I use the term ""human being"" for, it is proper when referring to an embryo. I'm not the one that question the use of the term. You can be of that opinion I suppose but I find they have no authority. Human rights are discussed when being violated against. They are violated mostly by governments but you can have them violated by people. You can also discuss them as we were now...in a general sense. The argument requires a reason for having human rights in the first place. Then UN certainly hasn't established this. This is yet another reason they are not an authority on the subject. To add to this, you can't extend human rights without a reasoning for rights. Without that all you would have to say is ""they aren't included therefore they have no rights"". Do you have any evidence for this? Seems the Bible is quoted more times than a UN report. I say that its not close for one, universally accepted means nothing, and the UN had no authority to begin with. Comparisons are not meant to be all inclusive of events. I use blacks and others as examples to show we traditionally have been wrong every time we say a human being is not worthy of rights. Blacks were ""inferior people"" and with the unborn we just declare them not people. The reasons for making such declarations will always vary but it seems traditionally the reasons are only seen as ""wrong"" long after the fact....as in 20/20 hindsight.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","03:54 PM","abortion-debates","179"
