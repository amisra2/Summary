Just don't expect everyone else to accept your personal definition as one that works for them. To me, it's ludicrous to define an embryo or foetus as a human being -- a human being is born. That's not to say that an embryo or foetus isn't human, of course it is, but a human being means much more to me than just tissue with human DNA, whatever its potential. In these days of cloning technology, any cell of your body is a potential human being, but that just doesn't make it an actual human being. Now, you are perfectly free to think in your own private definition that some gestating foetus is a human being -- so is any mother who harbours it, and I will respect the mother's definition. But I won't respect yours as anything other than your idiosyncratic one. I won't respect your definition for some third party female who wants or needs an abortion -- she's the one who decides it's a human being or not, not you or me. Until you get that through your noggin, you haven't a prayer of understanding what I'm saying.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","10:24 AM","abortion-debates","241"
"02-19-2008","10837",17,"lesz","302439","I think you are confusing electrical activity from nerve cells with coherent and regular brain waves indicative of a conscious state. Brain development isn't complete till some years after birth. Nerve cells start firing at about 6 weeks, but this isn't indicative of anything except that they are beginning to form synaptic networks and just starting to slowly organise themselves into a brain. There is a difference between the nascent brain which starts forming just before 6 weeks, and the rapid acceleration of brain development that begins at about 25-28 weeks. Or if you prefer, there's the Wiki summary. Note, the nervous system doesn't really develop enough to control any bodily functions till about the 26th week after fertilisation. One can call it a ""brain"", but what it really is, is a ""proto-brain"" -- the precursor of the mature brain. Its brain waves don't mean what you seem to think, that it is the developmental, emotional, conscious equivalent of a child or an adult human being. Scientifically speaking, that's nonsense.","lesz","302457","Oh, and Steve, you didn't respond to this: Electrical activity in nervous systems isn't indicative of consciousness -- even a cockroach can generate the brain waves akin to a human foetus, but I don't see you arguing the right to life of cockroaches. Neural activity is not the same as being a sentient being. Even jellyfish have nerves and muscles and electrical activity, but we don't accord them all that much respect. That's some science for you.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","10:30 AM","abortion-debates","242"

I'd go on to say you can't define words any way you want. Changing the definition of human being doesn't make something right or ok. Why does she get to decide? Can my mother decide if I am a human being right now? The argument was only about brain waves. I wasn't arguing that brain waves make someone deserving of rights. Brain waves begin at 6 weeks and I haven't seen anything to argue otherwise. This is the problem with debating you, you make a strawman argument out of everything. If I make an rebuttal to Another Opinion who said something like ""brain activity is what makes you a person"" with my response being ""well what does this mean because brain activity starts from 6 wks and develops until well after birth"" then I made no argument about brain activity being part of human rights or personhood or anything. You then have another poster come along and say brain waves don't start until 26wks and I say ""no it is 6wks"" which it is. You then pick it up and assume my argument is that at 6wks you have brain waves which makes you deserving of rights which is an argument I never made. You have created a strawman with the cockroach comparison. A classic fallacy when you aren't paying attention to detail.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","12:13 PM","abortion-debates","244"
"02-19-2008","10837",17,"Another opinion","302459","What I meant by that question was for you to point out some examples of more everyday situations in the US that people have labelled human rights abuses. Since you don't seem to think that rights are based on reasons but are based on proclamations, then I am not surprised. I don't get what you mean by that. Can you elaborate? There were certainly enough people around at the time arguing for the rights of blacks and certainly enough capable blacks (Frederick Douglas, etc.), that the Southern Slaveholders already had some evidence before them of the illogic of their opinions. They ignored the opposing evidence and stuck to their views because they ""knew"" they were right. By the 19th century, analytic reasoning and critical thinking were common enough that the lack of its use by Southern plantation owners was purposeful. I can just as easily hypothetically claim that you are wrong in saying that unfertilized eggs are not deserving of human rights. When human rights have been violated, then the common theme has been suffering and, very often, illogic in the assumptions made about the people that were made to suffer. What would you claim is the incorrect assumptions (about the characteristics of zygotes) that we on the pro-choice side make? You yourself once spoke of different levels of rights - essentially legal rights vs natural rights. There are many rights - the right to vote, the right of free speech, rights which protect one from cruel treatment, rights to property, rights to sue for breech of contract, rights for a jury, ... The UN doesn't address ALL those rights. It can't. It is not a world government. It just tries to address the worst rights abuses - mainly, the extreme ones that most often happen in war or by bad regimes that are tagged ""human rights"". You and I disagree that there is an absolute moral code. My arguement about the key importance of empathy in morality comes from simple observation about how people are brought up. ""How would you like it if that were done to you?"" or other such sayings are extremely popular among parents teaching kids the reasons behind a rule (once they are old enough to be able to be convinced by reasons). ""Do unto others"" also requires a sense of empathy to place oneself in the others shoes to realize the concequences of your actions. Judging from other posts, you do not seem to understand that any random brain waves do not mean a mental existence or sentience. Late fetuses can feel pain - where it takes a rudimentary level of mind to register that pain. Early embryos can have reflex actions, but it is only later that they can register pain in the brain. Either way, my main goal was not to defend them but to try to prevent this forum from going into another set of weeks devoted to arguements about definitions.","Steeeeve","302486","I don't think that was what I was referring to (just human rights..not human rights abuses). But we talk about human rights abuses on these forums as well. Morality is based on proclamations because reason is not a basis but a method. Reason can only take you from A to B but can't actually be A. It is simple: Prove reason. You can't do it without first violating reason (begging the question). Because of this you proclaim reason to be reasonable and true. This is just one example of a very proclamations one must make before coming up with a morality. Like in my example above..the very fundamental level of morality would be A. You can prove A but you have to get from A to B so you assume A and assume reason to get to B. From there on out you are ok with using reason. And you can't say it is any different now with the issue of abortion. I guess you could claim I can't prove it to be the same either but I don't claim proof but merely opinion that I see strong parallels in arguments from the slave time to the current issue of abortion. Indeed you can. This is why I use the argument as a means to advance other arguments and not use it alone. For example if I say X is a human being and then use arguments about how mistreatment of human beings in the past has proven to be wrong then the argument works better. Doesn't have to be physically suffering. It is the fact that a human right has been violated that is the problem. Someone shot in the head doesn't exactly suffer but has still had a human rights violation. I told you, that they are not deserving of human rights. I am asking about human rights and whether or not those are different for different ages. I 100% agree that there are different kinds of rights. Yet with no absolute you can't say this is true with absolute authority. Your denial of an absolute (which ironical creates an absolute) would have to except a different morality stance. Again those are arguing not for the existence of rights by someone but a violation of rights already thought to exist with the other. So if A and B are assumed to have the same rights you argue empathy or whatever to say if A does something to B then you violate B's rights. Now this doesn't address why A or B should have rights in the first place. Right now we have a situation where A has rights and B is said to not have rights. You need to argue why B is worthy of rights. This is a subtle difference and harder to show because it gets back to a belief in my opinion. This wasn't the point. You said ""I would not disccriminate against level of mental development"" to which I point out that mental development could be said to be beginning with the first activity of the brain..no matter how fundamental. Brain waves begin at 6 weeks so do you mean something different when talking about mental development? You can see how other members of a forum can so easily change the frame of a debate and construe phrases to make it seem like I was saying something I was not. I made no claim of mental existence or sentience when posting about brain waves. Feeling pain is not a self-awareness but a reaction. I am interested on your stance regarding self-awareness as in the ""I exist"" idea. Oddly enough I have heard many folks argue that since self-awareness develops so much later that you should be able to terminate up to one year of age (or varying depending on who is talking to me). Then you need to be posting to the members who brought it up in the first place. It is unfair to press me on it and not the cause when you want an honest debate. I know you are an honest debater so I don't think anything of it but I thought you should know that it came across as biased.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","12:38 PM","abortion-debates","246"

It is likely that anything of that sort occurs some time after the first organized electrical activity appears, if it even occurs before birth.

I'm just giving you my opinion. Well, then don't do it. I think when most people think of ""a human being"", they don't think of a foetus. They think of another post-natal person. It's her body the foetus is physically attached to and feeds from. That's why SHE gets to decide, and NOT you or me. Nope. YOU are a physically independent individual. And what she may think of you in private is not my business! Well, ""brain wave"" isn't really a well-defined scientific concept. All it means is any kind of periodic, neuronal electrical activity, and there are many different kinds of brain waves. Foetuses do not, so far as I know, generate electrical activity similar to neonates till fairly late in pregnancy. So you are right, and they are right, and all is right as right can be. And I agree with you that mere presence of electrical activity does not mean the generator of such activity deserves full human rights. Quit projecting.

This ""brain waves at 6 weeks!!!"" is just another ploy by religious activists to make early abortion seem far worse than it is. It's nothing more than anti-abortion propaganda. Anti-abortionists are really shooting themselves in the foot with this one. On the one hand, if they really mean that neuronal activity is the gold standard for possession of human rights, then they haven't a leg to stand on with regard to abortion before six weeks. On the other, they really set themselves up for scientific refutation as to where to draw the line. If science ever decides when self-awareness emerges during foetal development (or even post-natal development!), then they won't have a leg to stand on to prevent abortion (or even infanticide) before then. It's a very poor basis for argument, and it's really counter-religious as well, trying to turn a religious opinion into a scientific. I have far greater respect for anti-abortionists who argue on the basis that all human life at any stage is sacred (though I don't entirely agree with that -- I think there are rational degrees of sacredness and not everyone is going to agree on them); or even better, that all animal life is sacred, and should not be arbitrarily destroyed. Now, I'm not sure how far along either of those positions I'd care to go, but at least it's an argument based purely on ethical considerations -- i.e. due reverence for our fellow living beings -- without trying to force some answer out of science. It's respectable, if a tad extreme. Science isn't currently equipped to answer such questions -- all it can do is tell you what a foetus can or can't do at any stage of development. How we deal with that knowledge is then up to us, not to scientists.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","05:26 AM","abortion-debates","254"
