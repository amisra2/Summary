"02-04-2008",1,"10837","63","Dane","300115","No, because the law says so. read the Roe vs Wade decision, it clearly and unambiguously states that the fetus is not a person. Now, you can continue to lie or espouse wild fantasies (depending on how ignorant vs dishonest you are about this claim. but the law is clear. A fetus or an embryo is NOT a person. Given that we now have seen you spew the same lies time after time, we already know what lies you are going to push , so strictly speaking we don't need you, no. We already know what lies you would be using . Because I don't agree with your misrepresentation of Constitutional law? What nonsense. there was never a time when black people were not people. Any other lies you want to spew (Rhetorical question, of course there are). Nope, that's another of your lies. Please document your lie. (And no, the dred scott decision that pro-life liars like to drag out for this argument doesn't say such a thing so you better have some other source). Never claimed any species identity, liar. Nope, because constitutional law says so, your endless lies none withstanding. Nope, your deceitful strawman none withstanding.","Steeeeve","300144","So if the law says someone is not a person then they are not? I won't even go into the fact that Roe vs Wade was gutted by the Casey decision. ""Liar liar pants on fire."" Do you like repeating yourself in a sentence (see underline)? You haven't shown you know anything about the constitution yet and it is pretty obvious But the law said they weren't (in the 1800s)! Isn't this the criteria you use? Are you going to start saying I'm not a person? Really? This one is not even that disputed on these forums. It is hard to argue that the fetus or embryo are not a member of the species homo sapien. A little extreme on your part. You don't need to look at just Dred Scott but since you brought it up that is a great example (another example could be the constitution itself). Dred Scott said blacks were ""property"" and had no citizen rights in the constitution. ""regarded as beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race either in social or political relations, and so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect, and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit."" How could you not see that as anything other than devaluing human life? Really? So a fetus in a dog is no different than a fetus from a human? A human fetus is by its very definition part of the species homo sapien. In fact, when you started claiming ""parasite"" you naturally assume a different species (parasite defined as one species living off another). So I ask you again what species a human fetus is? So if constitutional law said a fetus and embryo is a human and abortion is illegal then you'd say this is true? The courts called them property before...why don't you? Were blacks ever just property and were blacks ever inferior like the courts said?","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","10:35 AM","abortion-debates","382"

[quote]But it didn't override Section IX of the Roe vs Wade decision. So your claim of fetal personhood remains an outright lie. The law stated no such thing. Please provide documentation for you lie. Really? How is a member of a species defined? You don't know? Then perhaps your claim is a bit premature and based on ignorance, eh!!! Exactly, Dred Scott was a decision about citizenship, not personhood like you falsely claimed. I never said it didn't, your lie none withstanding. Your claim was about being a person. Clearly the Dred Scott decision did NOT claim slaves and African-Americans not to be persons. So your claim is false. Nope, I didn't claim that either. Again, please explain how a species member is defined. I never said ANYTHING about a parasite. But since you are on that topic, certainly the fetus carries out a PARASITIC FUNCTION in the woman. You can not deny that and be honest. What does that have to do with anything? the issue was the word ""person.""

Blacks were not ""persons"" legally but I maintain they were always persons and always deserving of human rights. I'd hope you'd agree. And for the record, it is obvious that ""person"" in the 14th amendment did not cover the human fetus. This is all the court claimed of which none of it matters because person is not just a legal term. They were property for one, thought of as inferior for 2, and the constitution declared them 3/5ths of a person. For you to even deny that blacks weren't treated as persons under the law in the 1800s is a remarkable rewrite of history and dangerous. There you go answering questions again..... The fetus is a member of the human species. Get over it. All that is needed to be a member of a species is an entity with its own DNA if functioning systems. Again, you already acknowledged this by calling the fetus a parasite thus implying it was actually a different species. They were denied citizenship because they were inferior persons and property... are you actually going to sit here and tell me blacks were treated as persons in the 1800s? It certainly did. It claimed they were inferior. Why wouldn't it be? You already have denied it because a parasite has to be of a different species and you claim no species. You seem to think the law is everything so if the law defined a fetus or embryo as human (or person if you prefer) then does this make it so? Hahahaha, you are no different then the dozens of others than have come in here rambling off inconsistent notions that have no basis in reality or logic.

It is about rights and therefore about the law. Hmm, backpedaling. Yes, they were always persons and due human rights. So when you make claims about ""rights"" of a fetus as a person, then you know you are lying. Thanks for that admission. Not affecting their personhood despite your claim. False. The 3/5th designation was strictly a census designation but then that's not what I stated, your lie none withstanding. So your false accusation is irrelevant to this discussion.

Now apply that to an unborn baby and you see that personhood does not get defined by just the law. And roe v. wade was only referring to the original meaning of the 14th amendment. So it was not an overall view. Then what do you state? Were blacks treated as equal persons under the law in the 1800s? If not, then explain why they were still persons if the law didn't say so. Answered in the last post. Why are you scared to answer? Because you know the human embryo and fetus is a human being? Fallacy aside, that does not fit the definition so no. The unborn does fit the definition and is therefore a human being. You just did in the last post Roe vs. Wade never declared an unborn not to be a person...just not a person in terms of the 14th amendment. So were blacks inferior beings in the 1800s? You haven't claimed no species? Then what species is the unborn? Only to a fool. So if the law changes then you'd be against abortion? Human being is a biological issue and it just so happens the unborn is defined as a human being (no surprise). And you agree with this?

Because you first insisted that it was about African-Americans not being person's under the law and you now going away from that claim when proven wrong. Because that's my opinion. Actually, the law DID treat them as persons, just not as citizens and free persons. Rights are guaranteed by the law. Unless you have the law, you have no rights. Actually, the issue specifically was whether their designation as property affected them being persons, and it didn't as you now finally admit to despite denying it previously. As I said, I accept your appology for being wrong before. It does actually. It just happens that slaves DID fit within the definition of a person, while an embryo does not. As the 14th Amendment IS the Amendment dealing with personhood, yes it is. The law still saw them as persons. The law didn't give them rights as free persons, but they were still persons. Nope. You did NOT provide any clear answer to how members of a species is defined. Why must you lie ? (bolded and underlied per your request - see later) ""Being"" still implies individual existence. As such, embryos and fetuses are not beings. No fallacy. YOUR definition fits a hydatidiform mole as well as an embryo or fetus. Actually, it DOES fit your definition. It is a human fetus but not a being. Likewise, the hydatidiform mole is a human hydatidiform mole but not a being. Nope, I never called the fetus a parasite. YOU ARE LYING !!!!

There was no legal ruling on the definition of a word just like their wasn't in Roe vs Wade. Blacks were not considered persons under the law in that they were not treated as such. If you are property you are already not treated as a person. No? Because a comparison between two things is the second step of the process. You would already have a ""good"" in mind (meaning the standard already set) and now you apply it to real life situations. I can't think of a way where good vs evil could come about that is not just pure belief. There really can't be a reason behind it because reason is more of a method and in a method you have to have a starting point . So if you are reasoning what soap to buy you ultimately go all the way back to the most fundamental belief you have (granted for soap its not really hard). In other words you can't prove your very basic starting point and thus it is belief. No I agree it is philosophy but philosophy doesn't teach one standard for ethic or morality. The purpose of philosophy is to get one to think about morality not to teach one what it is. I am saying that without a moral absolute then perhaps they should stay our of issues that don't affect them but it doesn't force them too. In fact, without the absolute standard they can do whatever because of the lack of guidance. There would be no reason to do something that affects someone else but there is also no reason not to. Random chance I guess you could say. Yes, you force morals on people because they may violate certain rights of people. But rights of people is a morality judgment so really you are forcing those morals because your morality says so. As an aside, since I believe the fetus to be a person doesn't that make it only logical that I be against abortion and force the morality on others? If you could do it for born persons there is no reason not to force that morality on non-born persons. As for animal cruelty this is just a point showing that morality is often times influencing laws and not when it affects another human. Doesn't this prove the point actually?

They were legally property. Substance over form qualifies here, just because the constitution doesn't take the time to define who is or isn't a person doesn't mean it doesn't inherently do so. It did say they were property though and that makes you not a person. How would you compare them? Don't you already have to have good and evil to decide this? If you comparing them and good and evil doesn't exist then how could you say one is good and one is evil? You can have a morality based on yourself but it leads to evil things (at least in my perspective) and basically declares yourself god. The problem with this is not that you can't do it but it doesn't hold up as a morality that can work. Many people do it though and I call it a selfish mindset. If you base your morality on your feelings then you can't say what Cho did at Virginia Tech was wrong...at least not wrong in the general. He went by his feelings and that led to evil....granted this is an extreme example. It just removes any objective standard and you wouldn't be able to convince somebody of an evil if they feel it is good. But like I said, its possible to have a morality based on this. ha, my problem is I can't find my kind of soap....its always at the bottom and deep in the shelf or something. I don't understand.

If you are comparing for which one is ""more good"" then you already have an understanding of what good is. I'd say we are inherently evil and often times it is the legal consequences or lack of opportunity that holds us back. A good example of this is internet downloading. Without a question this is stealing yet people find it to be ok because lack of enforcement (easy to get away with) so it is justified to being ok. Of course if you would have asked someone prior to the internet if stealing music was ok (said just like that) then almost everyone would have said yes. In fact, today you don't see people walk into Best Buy, take the CDs, and walk out as if it were a-ok. So I think people will do the evil thing if given the opportunity. The evil thing always is the selfish thing. Yet someone would already have to have morals for this to work. Otherwise you would everyone saying ""i'll get more morals from society"" and because everyone is saying that society doesn't have a set of morals..just confusion. so you get back to the idea that morality has to be based on yourself. I morality based on yourself would be made to benefit yourself. This system won't always lead to a selfish result or always be immoral but it does lead to a moral system that can't justify itself. Well at this point you say there is an outside standard for judging the abnormality of a person. This would have to mean that morals can't be made in ones own mind because you say Cho can't do so. So now we get into a situation of what this outside standard of morality is (ie. it isn't based upon yourself). Yet many moral values are disputed...this forum is proof of that. If it is a trait then you also get into the argument used on the gay rights forums which is if it is an inherent trait then you can't say its wrong (which I actually disagree with). That goes back to my Cho example. If that is inherent then how does one say Cho was wrong and not just dancing to his DNA? For curious sake, has there been any research to suggest this is the case? I was just providing an example of something that happens at random. Everything is brainwashing to some extent. I say the difference is that a brainwashed brain would have reasoning and logic twisted as opposed to being consistent with what one says. Welcome to my world. It isn't one side of the fence that comes up with boneheaded ways of thinking. I generally don't read peoples posts who agree with me because it is a waste but sometimes I do and I am embarrassed that they believe what I do. I thought about actually finding a way to address to terrible posters on these forums because they actually end up bringing the good posters down sometimes. I have some ideas if you ever are interested (PM only). And yes this discussion has made me think as well...which is a bad thing sometimes ha.

Better to talk to one that disagrees with you and doesn't have their head in the sand then someone who disagrees with you and refuses to listen.
