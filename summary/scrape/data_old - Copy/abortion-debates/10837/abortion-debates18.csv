It's her body the foetus is physically attached to and feeds from. That's why SHE gets to decide, and NOT you or me. Well, ""brain wave"" isn't really a well-defined scientific concept. All it means is any kind of periodic, neuronal electrical activity, and there are many different kinds of brain waves. Foetuses do not, so far as I know, generate electrical activity similar to neonates till fairly late in pregnancy. So you are right, and they are right, and all is right as right can be. And I agree with you that mere presence of electrical activity does not mean the generator of such activity deserves full human rights.","Steeeeve","302659","And I disagree.

"02-20-2008","10837",18,"Another opinion","302503","I am just wondering what types of rights you place under the general category of ""human rights"". The way I have heard the term ""human rights"" used in the news stories I have heard throughout my life has been to refer to basic rights from cruel treatment. Perhaps I was jumping to assumptions, but you seemed to imply that more everyday rights could be referred to as ""human rights"", which is why I was and am looking for SPECIFIC examples. But A doesn't need to be a proclamation, it can be an observation. Where morality is concerned, 'A"" can be an observation of human nature and how it reacts to various stimuli. For example, humans suffer when pain is inflicted on them. If groups are targeted for a particular characteristic, then most of those of the group will live their lives in fear. There are probably thousands of such larger-scale or smaller observations one can make, and one can use reason to analyze those observations. Furthermore, history has shown the consequences of various moral systems, so many systems have already been tried out. It is not an exact science, but a combination of observation of human nature combined with reason can get one far. On the opposite spectrum, proclamations, if they are not supported by reason, run the risk of being either unjust in most people's view, or ineffectual, or illogical... I am not against proclamations in general, just against proclamations that are not allowed the judgment of reason and comparison to reality. What do you mean by ""prove reason""? Reason is logic. One either has an illogical arguement or a logical arguement or a mixture of the two. Yes, reason has to start at some point and go from there but, as I said, reason can start from observation. But you haven't outlined the details of that parallel, which makes your argument very flimsy indeed. That is just playing with definitions. I can say randomly that unfertilized eggs are human beings since they are human and have the potential (as do zygotes) to grow into full humans. Well, there is the moment of pain of getting shot in the head, but a large part of the problem is the fear that is caused by random members of a particular group getting shot. People want to live and a threat of death causes suffering. You think human rights kick in at fertilization. I think human rights kick in at the start of mental existence. We simply chose different points at which to start human rights. My choice is based on the concept of ""I think, therefore I am"" - i.e. that it is not bodies alone that I value but people = bodies + mind (of any level). The brain controls both physical and mental processes. Just because a brain exists does not mean that mentality exists. The brain has to be developed enough to have some mental function - not just physical function. Until we have mental function, we do not mentally exist. It is those aspects of our existence which many religions attribute to a soul. Science has shown that much of that function, probably all of it (though I hope not), resides in the sufficiently developed brain. Then why did you bring up brain waves? Was it simply a non-sequitor? Many animals do not recognize themselves as separate entities in terms of having any concept of ""I"". So, they are not self aware. Nonetheless, they can have emotions, can have some rudimentary level of reasoning, can feel and register pain, etc. - i.e. they have some level of mind. Once again, a mind doesn't need to recognize its own existence to exist. Well, it takes two to tango. I would urge all of you (both you and your pro-choice opponents) to just agree to disagree when it comes to the definitions. My assumptions, which you have not yet refuted, is that your goal was to try to force that definition of human being and then use it to claim that human rights should apply to fetuses.","Steeeeve","302663","Those rights not dependent on anything are human rights. There probably aren't many but the main one is you have a right to be alive as a human. Observation uses a reasoning. If you make an observation you are answering questions and deciding things with that. You could claim an observation to be an 'A' (but not the first A) but you still proclaim reasoning to be true in order to make a decision about that observation. It would be like taking a picture and not looking at it (the observation) and then looking at it to make a decision (the reasoning). The picture alone with no reasoning does you no good. Observation is merely a tool and not a beginning point. They beg the question though. You can't prove reasoning by reasoning. Reasoning is a proclamation by itself. No it can't start from observation because you already have to have the ability to reason to make that observation mean anything. You can't prove reasoning to be true and therefore it is a proclamation. I never was asked too and we haven't had a forum topic on it in a long time. You play with definitions here. I assume in my example that human being is what it is. I didn't mention anything about what I was referring to other than human being. ""X"" in my example could be you and I if you want. I don't feel the need to argue the definition of every word in every argument. Not to the dead person. Now you get into the idea of society suffering and if that matters. Well, if society is ""suffering"" because they don't like the thought of abortion then is this reason to consider it wrong? So human rights are equal among all ages from the point you think they get them until the end? That is my question. I don't question your position I only question the statement you made and how it can be taken to mean something different. Mental development might be a bad choice of words. Because of what you said. You said you do not discriminate with regards to mental development. I brought up brain waves asking if that is a stage of mental development (which it could be said to be). You clarified that is not what you meant in the above paragraph (quote). So it isn't really self-awareness that matters. Am I understanding this correctly? No, it takes one person to start such a stupid argument and it takes two to continue it. I chose to continue it because I can get an idea of certain posters are thinking (or not thinking as the case may be). No, I refute this. It started when I spoke using the word ""baby"" to describe a human fetus. ""But you are ok with a woman deciding what is right for someone else's own body...specifically the babies?[sic]"" I wasn't forcing any term on anyone...merely using a term as one can. Dane would be the first to disapprove of this usage. """"Babies"" are a stage reached after birth.""","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","09:20 AM","abortion-debates","257"

You aren't going to agree with ANY argument that permits ANY abortion. Duh! Tell me something I don't know about your opinions. Nope. It's not a woman's ""fault"" an embryo has grown. And as an embryo isn't aware of anything, it has no rights. For starters, you haven't presented anything ""from reputable sources"". Sorry, but neither ""human being"" nor ""brain waves"" mean what you want them to mean. Not to me. If you would stop trying to twist definitions to suit your religious prejudices, you wouldn't get into these semantic messes you can't escape from. Yes, neuronal electrical activity exists at about six weeks. You can't really call it a brain with all the functions of a brain, though. It's a developing brain, non-sentient at that stage. It can't even know it exists. It is true that brains develop gradually over several years. The important question to me is when sentience develops. I can't pinpoint that, but it seems ludicrous to assert it starts at ""6 weeks"" without an iota of evidence for it, and plenty of reason to think otherwise.

"02-20-2008","10837",18,"Another opinion","302688","Early brain waves themselves are not a sign of mental development. They are too disorganized which, along with analysis of early brains, shows a lack of communication between brain cells that is needed for mental existence. Even late-term organized brain waves do not guarantee a mental existence but support the possibility that a mental existence might be there. It is mental existence that matters. Self-awareness, as I understand it, requires a mind to recognize itself. I do not require a mind to recognize itself in order to say it exists. So, yes, self-awareness doesn't matter to me for the basis of human rights. That is a more developed mental state (which still happens quite early). My main moral drive is the ""do unto others"" which is itself largely driven by empathy. I can empathize with a mind, whether or not it recognizes itself. A being with a mind but no self-awareness can still suffer, have emotions, etc. - just like many animals.","lesz","302726","No quibbles there. There is good reason to think there are plenty of animals that are self-aware. I don't think the concept of suffering has any meaning without self-awareness. Without self-awareness, suffering just becomes a reflexive response. Change the pH of a bacterial medium, and the bacteria will reflexively respond, but would you want to claim they are suffering? So to me, self-awareness is critical in the assessment of human rights, and to the extent that many other animals are self-aware, I am happy to concede that they have animal rights. I draw the line at vegetable and bacterial rights, because i have no evidence for self-awareness in those kingdoms. Yet. Self-awareness is, I believe, the key to abortion rights and choices. Once a foetus has developed to the point of being self-aware, and be cognizant of pain, rather than just reflexively responsive to some stimulus, then the rights of the mother shrink dramatically.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","03:19 PM","abortion-debates","261"

THE NEUROLOGY OF SELF-AWARENESS What is the self? How does the activity of neurons give rise to the sense of being a conscious human being? Even this most ancient of philosophical problems, I believe, will yield to the methods of empirical science. It now seems increasingly likely that the self is not a holistic property of the entire brain; it arises from the activity of specific sets of interlinked brain circuits. But we need to know which circuits are critically involved and what their functions might be. It is the ""turning inward"" aspect of the self its recursiveness that gives it its peculiar paradoxical quality.","Another opinion","302731","I think self-awareness goes beyond just having a mind. It seems to include the concept of recognizing oneself as separate - which is more developed than just going along experiencing life without thinking of separateness. From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness: Self-awareness is the explicit understanding that one exists. Furthermore, it includes the concept that one exists as an individual, separate from other people, with private thoughts. It may also include the understanding that other people are similarly self-aware. Self-awareness remains a critical mystery in neurology, philosophy, psychology, biology, and artificial intelligence. I think that most animals don't recognize their existence as separate beings. They just experience sensations from the environment and act accordingly based on instinct and some reasoning. Higher order animals might recognize their own uniqueness - ex. apes or dolphins will recognize themselves in a mirror. I don't think a being needs to recognize itself in order to mentally exist and have a mind. However, it is still possible that I am misinterpreting the concept of self-awareness. ---on edit----- Here is another quote I found on self-awareness. From http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/rama...n07_index.html - quoted from a neurologist from UC, San Diego : So, self-awareness is not the self itself but that ""turning inward"" aspect - i.e. a recognition of self.

I think also the arguments for extending this property to many other animals are pretty good -- I've owned both cats and dogs, for example, and it strikes me none of them were automatons who were unaware of their existence as individuals. Not at our level, obviously, but pretty close. They are certainly capable of feeling many emotions familiar to ourselves. I suspect that self-awareness comes in degrees. Is a cockroach self-aware?

This was denigrated as anthropomorphisation. There was, it was said, no evidence to suppose animals could feel as we do, because animals can't talk and communicate as we do. Therefore, it was appropriate to assume they didn't. I think there has been a huge sea change in the biology community. Now, it's inappropriate to assume animals have no feelings.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","04:17 PM","abortion-debates","264"

I don't know, but I wouldn't be surprised to find it has some glimmer of self-awareness. What is commonly called self-consciousness (even in philosophy occasionally) is really two distinct phenomena. On one hand we have what I call the self-model. Basically the self-model is how we mentally represent our selves, it contains information about what motivates us, as well as information such as how we might look to an outside observer. The other phenomena that is sometimes called self-consciousness is self-awareness. Self-awareness is much less abstract than the self-model. In the simplest possible terms self-awareness is the process by which perceptions and knowledge are felt as being part of us. When you are hungry you feel the need to get some food for yourself; it is self-awareness that is responsible for the knowledge that this feeling of hunger is our feeling and that we need to do something in order to satisfy it. ... Now let us turn to self-awareness. As I mentioned above self-awareness is closely tied to our perception of the external world and of our own internal mental states. It is not simply perception though; it contains the knowledge that these perceptions are mine, and not someone elses. Although I cant provide you with an objective explanation for the cause of self-awareness it is quite easy to demonstrate that it exists. Consider a man who has been for a long time without water. Let us allow that he has the perception of his thirst but no self-awareness of this perception. If we presented this man with a glass of water then he has no special reason to drink it. Yes, he perceives thirst, but if he doesnt realize that it is his thirst, so why should he be motivated to drink? Because situations such as this never actually arise we can be reasonably sure that we all possess self-awareness. Let me use an example to help distinguish this self-awareness from our self-model. My perception that I am sitting down is a good example of self-awareness. It is true that the more abstract information about this event, such as what it might look like to someone else is part of the self-model. However the direct perception of the feeling of sitting, and the knowledge that I am the one doing the sitting, is self-awareness. Thus, in contrast to the self-model, self-awareness is immediate and tied to perception. Before we answer the bigger question about the relationship between consciousness and self-consciousness lets look at the possibility of animals being self-conscious. It seems pretty clear to me that most animals lack a self-model or possess only a rudimentary one at best. For example a parakeet can be fooled by a mirror into thinking that it has a friend with it, so clearly it lacks a self-model that contains expectations of how the parakeet looks to an observer. Self-awareness however seems much more likely. If you think that animals are conscious in any way then it seems obvious that they must be self-aware, since they are motivated by their desires as much as we are. So are animals self-conscious? Yes and no.","Another opinion","302748","I think we might have a different understanding of the term ""self-aware"". I suppose that there are various levels of self-awareness and the fact that it seems to be used in different ways by different sources muddies the picture. On the highest level, ""self-awareness"" is used to denote some inner reflection about oneself - i.e. ""know thyself"" - which is clearly a higher level intellectual pursuit. At a lower level of use of the term self-awareness, most animals might exhibit self-awareness by recognizing the difference between another creature and themselves. If the other creature gets hurt, they themselves will not get hurt. They themselves cannot control the actions of the other creature, etc. At the lowest level definition of self-awareness, it seems to denote an understanding that the sensations one experiences belong to yourself. However, even at that level, a creature that is not self-aware could experience such sensations, but not recognize that they are the ones to whom those sensations belong and, therefore, do nothing about them. There is an interesting web-site speaking about this lowest level sense of self-awareness - http://onphilosophy.wordpress.com/2006/06/19/: This philosophical analysis suggests that creatures that have no self-awareness can indeed still get perceptions - i.e. can still feel pain, etc. They just will not make the mental step of realizing that the pain is theirs and they need to do something about it. Where morality is concerned, I think that, as long as there is that perception of pain beyond a simple reflex action, then the being deserves some rights to protect it from the pain. Indeed, as long as there is a mentality that is able to perceive, then I personally think that this means that there exists some level of human mind which, by its very existence, deserves some rights.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","05:53 PM","abortion-debates","265"
