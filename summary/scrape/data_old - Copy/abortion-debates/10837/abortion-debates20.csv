"02-25-2008","10837",20,"preciouslife","303428","First I'd like to thank you for your response. It was very polite and you got your point across. So because the brain isn't fully developed it's ok to end a human life? That reasoning is along the same lines of why slavery was constitutionally ok. Because in the opinion of the oppressors the black man was only considered to be 3/5 human. As for the comparison to someone with brain damage, that is something that cannot be recovered from. A fetus is developing and therefore will become a fully functional human at some point. That is like comparing a totaled vehicle with one being manufactured. The fact that the brain is not fully developed does not make it less human. It's just an attempt to justify terminating a pregnancy. As for religous views of the soul entering the body for the first time, that is a whole different debate but I understand the point you were making. The problem is that as a society it is ok to end an unborn human life based on the opinion that the life is worth less than that of our own. As for the unfertilized egg, it does not have all the cells necessary to develop into a fully functional human life. It is not a human life until it is fertilized. Some may call that an opinion but according to biology it is a fact.","Dane","303430","It's because the brain doesn't function AT ALL. And ""human life"" is a rather iffy postulation here. Is the Hydatidiform Mole a ""human life""? Like the right-to-life crowd sees women, you mean? You need to read up on this. For CENSUS purposes only, because the Northern states were worried about census data assigning more representatives to the South, the compromise was struck that slaves only counted 3/5th on the census data. This does not mean what you claim it to mean. Maybe. perhaps. can you predict the future? And certainly if aborted, that argument is moot. Or with a lump of ore that might become steel and a car. But certainly less sentient. In fact not sentient at all. Nope, it is an argument against revisionist linguistics and emotional hyperbole of the fundamentalist right-to-lifers. The argument FOR terminating pregnancy has nothing to do with the fetus. It relies on the woman having the right to control her own bodily resources. All the stuff about the fetus and whatnot, that is arguments in response to right-to-life arguments. It has absolutely nothing to do with arguments FOR the right to terminate a pregnancy. Rather, that the sentient, sensate woman is worth more than non-sentient, non-sensate tissue. Neither does the embryo. And neither does the fetus. That is NOT an argument that is going to help you. You really don't want to go there. really? Sperm and egg are not ""human""? What species are they? Or are you saying that they are not live cells? Just because you make an absolutist claim about this still means that you are wrong. REALLY? You just goofed. According to biology, your claim of a fact is an outright falsehood. PRESUMABLY because you were ignorant about that and not because you outright lied, right? But here is a hint for you. I suggest you NOT go around and make claims about facts on behalf of science. Some of us here are scientists and we WILL call you on inaccurate claims every time. And when you make false claims on behalf of science, rest assured that we will come down on you HARD every time.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","01:21 AM","abortion-debates","286"

Don't forget that many woman decide to terminate their pregnancies at 7 weeks and up. Have you seen images of a 7 week aborted fetus? You can see fingers and toes.","Dane","303431","For the woman whom you seek to restrict from getting an abortion, your position feels like you are doing just that to her. This is about function, about sentience. Most happen at 6 weeks. I am sure that before you venture into those kinds of arguments, you know the data, right? So? What does that symbolize? Frankly, emotional histrionics or fetal porn doesn't carry much weight.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","01:24 AM","abortion-debates","287"
"02-25-2008","10837",20,"None","None","None","bhbcu64","303476","Once again, the profetallifers on this forum have managed to turn the debate so that it is being carriecxd on on their terms. The real question is simply this: Who gets to decide the future of a woman's pregnancy - the woman herself or some nameless, faceless government bureaucrat? If one argues in favor of the bureaucrat, then there must needs be criminal sanctions for violating the ""rules"". Are we really ready to see our wives, girlfriends, sisters, and nieces being hauled off to prisojn or worse for the ""crime"" of securing an abortion? In a nutshell, that'w what it boils down to. If we cannot trust women with a decison on the most intimate aspect of her life, how can we ever trust her with a child? Maybe it's time to move this discussion off the angels on the head of a pin to something a good deal more practical and substantive.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","02:54 PM","abortion-debates","289"
"02-25-2008","10837",20,"preciouslife","303429","Thanks for the response. I don't feel it is right to judge life based on what it looks like. Sure the blastocyst looks like a blob and a little kid looks like a precious bundle of joy (sometimes). But the fact that they look different doesn't mean that it is ok to destroy the uglier of the two. Also, it is never morally right to destroy one human life to save another.. It is really hard for this society to not judge by appearences. Don't forget that many woman decide to terminate their pregnancies at 7 weeks and up. Have you seen images of a 7 week aborted fetus? You can see fingers and toes","thelmoose","303489","I was not talking about appearance at all. You posited that the blastocyst and a child are the same thing. I was maintaining there is a great deal of difference between a clump of undifferentiated cells and a seven year old child. I asked you if you thought there was any difference between these two and you did not answer. On the contrary, we do this all the time. There are wars, acts of self defense, death penalties, justified police shootings, etc. Appearances have nothing to do with it. That is one of the main reasons I object to using images of a 7 week aborted fetus as a point of argument. It is emotional and sensational and not a reasoned argument. Fingers and toes are cute and precious and all, like cuddly puppies, but that is not relevant to this serious adult discussion.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","04:03 PM","abortion-debates","290"

Do you disagree with Another Opinion on this?","thelmoose","303505","This is kind of loaded. I do not want to be in a position stating whether I agree with a third poster's opinion based on your assertion that is his opinion. I don't know if AO holds that opinion or not. Even if you show me a post confirming that, I would rather he address his own opinions on things, not me. However, I will state that I believe that arguments that appeal to emotion only and do not have a sound intellectual underpinning are not valid arguments and are merely manipulation. That is not to say some intellectual arguments might not, in addition, have some emotion overtones if they strike at the heart of an emotional issue. Strong arguments need not be sterile and cold. As per your implication, any valid argument might make one group sympathetic for the issues of some other group, like gaining rights for said group. This may be getting a little far afield from my original post, but I am trying to answer your question.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","05:01 PM","abortion-debates","292"

Do you disagree with Another Opinion on this?","Another opinion","303524","Just to try to clarify, I think that arguements for empathy or sympathy lie at the core of many moral arguements. However, any such emotional arguements have to have a basis in reality. For example, one cannot argue rights for rocks because one has an anthropomorphic feeling of sympathy for rocks. Sympathy or empathy , by its very definition, is (from the online Merriam-Webster dictionary, second definition) : the action of understanding, being aware of, being sensitive to, and vicariously experiencing the feelings, thoughts, and experience of another of either the past or present without having the feelings, thoughts, and experience fully communicated in an objectively explicit manner . Such a valid sense of empathy requires that the ""other"" have feelings, thoughts and experience, which, in turn, requires a mental existence. Otherwise, one is falsely attaching a personality to an object - as in the first definition of Empathy under Merriam Webster: the imaginative projection of a subjective state into an object so that the object appears to be infused with it - where the key point is ""imaginative"" - i.e. not real. I often find pro-life proponents engaging in exactly this second type of empathy. They imagine that, because the embryo is starting to look human, that it can suffer or that one can empathize with it. Some have even written imaginary letters from the unborn. This type of thinking is just imaginary and false.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","06:37 PM","abortion-debates","293"

I'm not going to quote everything and answer everything because it would take hours. As for when I stated the so called fact. That may be opinion, I was under the impression that when all the cells necessary to form a being were there that according to biology that is when life begins. This may have been anothers opinion. So according to biology I may not know when life actually begins. So call it opionion, it doesn't really change my view either way. As far as the blastocyst goes, it does have all the cells necessary to form into a completely functional adult human, that is why I see it as a human being. The sperm by itself and the egg by itself are not complete. A lump of ore does not make a car. That was just me trying to make a point. I love that we have free choice in the country and I don't want to take away freedom. I just have difficulty understanding why it is ok for a woman to choose to destroy another life. The fact that it is in her body and dependent on her is not enough to convince me that it should be ok. Thelmoose - to answer your question... In my opinion the only difference between the blastocyst and a 7 year old child is appearence and function. I really wish I could see the blastocyst as nothing more than a mass of cells. That would be easy. So for you pro-choicers... Does late term abortion seem to be ok with you? What about partial birth. I'm talking after they can feel pain and they have functioning brains? Or does the womans choice outweigh the life of the innocent in this as well?","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","07:46 PM","abortion-debates","294"

Calling a blastocyst a mass of cells is completely accurate. It is not more or less ""easy"" that anything else. You seem to imply that statement is making a value judgement. Maybe there is a collective noun that you would prefer, a gaggle of cells, maybe? Generally speaking, I would oppose abortion as fetal viability becomes more likely. It is a rare (I would submit unheard of) circumstance that abortions are performed on fetuses that ""can feel pain and they have functioning brains"". If the life of the mother necessitated ending the pregnancy at this stage, they would attempt delivery, not abortion. You need to learn something about partial birth abortion. It is a term made up by politicians and has no clinical meaning. It is unrelated to gestational stage. All your questions are so loaded and leading.

""Partial Birth"" abortion does have meaning. It may be called something else inside the clinics.

Certainly, what the anti-choice crowd calls partial birth abortion occurs BEFORE sentience and ability to feel anything, so your question doesn't make sense. So again, I feel you need to define your terms before we can answer here. Are you talking about abortions after the 27th-32nd week? Because these for sure are very rare and likely are for medical necessities. As such, denying women these abortions will directly put their lives at risk. If that are the abortions you are talking about, then I would find anybody objecting to them to be despicable. Another loaded word of emotional hyperbole.

More emotional histrionics. And the question begged, of course, is what that matters. Some muscle cells with an automatic pulsation rhythm are pulsating. So what? Not unknown, science actually explored this. And no, there is absolutely NO pain sensation at 6 weeks. You have to add another 20-26 weeks before there is any sensation. So that claim is nonsense. This is where you need to actually educate yourself from scientific sources rather than getting your info from pro-choice lie-sites. Nope. ""Birth"" is a specific term referring to the 3 stages of labor. No such occurrence happens during an abortion, so your CATCH PHRASE, your expression of emotional histrionics is indeed meaningless your denial none withstanding. Again, get your information from something other than pro-life lie-sites. The D&X procedure is specifically done to reduce the need for cervical dilation during the time of pregnancy where the fetal head is much wider than the torso. Once you hit 3rd trimester, the fetal torso gets so wide that there is no benefit from the more involved and complicated procedure. So your claim is flat-out false. The procedure is done from 13-24 weeks. That sounds like pure nonsense. More emotional histrionics. ""Baby"" is a term referring to a developmental stage beginning AFTER birth (you know, after the 3 stages of labor). As such, claiming that the fetus is a ""baby"" certainly IS a catch-phrase, is emotional histrionics and revisionist linguistic hyperbole. (1) How is it innocent? (2) ""unborn child"" sounds like more emotional histrionics. Sounds like the equivalent of calling you an undead corpse.

So lets make my view of a late term after 21 weeks. On the matter of partial birth, I responded just a few minutes ago to thelmoose about that. I'll say again that it is unknown whether or not a child can feel pain at 6 weeks. As for the extremely rare case where a womans life is at risk because of the baby and she has to choose between herself or the child which could result in possible death for both. Who am I to say what decision she should make. That is a horrible thing for someone to have to choose. I do know, however, that my wife almost died during pregnancy and right after pregnancy because of the baby and she would have never chose herself. As for the innocent thing... a kid an adult a fetus an old person about to die, whatever... how about just another life, innocent or not. I think most people would agree that a newborn child is pretty innocent.
