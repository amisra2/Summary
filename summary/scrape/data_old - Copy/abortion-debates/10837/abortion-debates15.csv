The journal requires one author to be member of their organization, it refuses independent editing and requires the authors to pay to be submitted. As I have pointed out, these requirements precludes it being a scientific journal. Your ongoing claims to the contrary, after you have been shown otherwise, makes you a poster of outright lies . Really? Where is it listed that the article is reviewed by experts in the field, and who do not know who the authors are? Oh, wait, you didn't provide that information anywhere. You are again LYING !!!! Let me help you with some easy reviews: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review You got to be incredibly ignorant about this when you don't even know that the secrecy is about who the author is. We KNOW who the peer-reviewers are, but the peer-reviewers are not supposed to know who the authors are. Sheesh. Is there ANYTHING at all that you know about the Scientific Method? Or are you utterly and completely science-illiterate Are you? Where is your documentation?","Steeeeve","302007","There is nothing that you have given that shows this journal to not be credible. The fact that they are associated with the AAAS (the writers of the journal Science) is proof enough. Furthermore, I showed where a company responsible for maintaining a database articles has declared this journal to be peer-reviewed and acceptable. You provided the information actually. See that Word document you posted at the bottom. It says: ""Manuscripts will be reviewed by experts in the research area"". Furthermore, there is no criteria stating the author cannot know who is reviewing or that they have to know. You are grasping at straws here. I documented where you are lying. That does not make me wrong. So your claim is yet ANOTHER LIE . Are you at all able to post without lying ? I find it a little ironic that you quote wikipedia to try and prove a scientific journal is not up to journal standards. Furthermore, nothing in that wikipedia article suggests this article isn't peer reviewed. In fact, we have already seen where people believe it to be peer reviewed. Seems your article suggests the peer-reviewers shouldn't be known by the public. Furthermore, are you claiming wikipedia is the standard? http://www.aaas.org/aboutaaas/affili...ies_of_science","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","12:19 PM","abortion-debates","211"

"02-18-2008","10837",15,"Another opinion","302304","The whole point was that the subject of human rights and abortion was, as you say, implied. If you had been having that discussion in a completely new forum (not 4forums.com where your views are known) that has nothing to do with abortion or human rights, then you probably would have had much less enthusiastic rebuttals of your arguements of embryos being called biologically human beings, since there would have been no assumed conotations carried with that word. Your arguements here of embryos being called human beings was obviously transparent - at least to me and I would be very surprised if had not been transparent to the others you were discussing this point with. Can you give some specific examples of more everyday situations in the US where ""human rights"" are discussed? It doesn't necessarily focus on that, but the appeals for rights in specific situations often mimic the original drive for rights that drove people to demand them and governments to eventually grant them. However, my guess is that it is not these people-demanded and government-granted rights that you had in mind but that you have in mind some automatically existing rights based on a global proclamation of rights - be they ""natural rights"" or a religious view of rights. I suspect that we may be getting back into the discussion territory of proclamations vs reasons, where I think that there were original reasons for people to have rights and you may think that there is a blanket statement that one can make about rights. There were discussions about ""natural rights"" among philosophers, which were then adapted by politicians supporting rights, but philosphers generally tried to defend their own views of ""natural rights"" with reasoning. I think that the only area where a proclamation of rights is not necessarily supported by reasons is in the realm of religion and suspect that this is where you are coming from in your ideas about rights. I argue that their reasoning was illogical and could have been disproven if even minor objective investigations would have been made - thus curtailing the slaveholders ability to use bogus arguements. Stepping back to your comparison between slavery and abortion in denying rights, what incorrect assumptions about embryos do you claim that pro-choice proponents make? Here, I am looking for something similar to my outline of the incorrect assumptions made by slaveholders about blacks. You didn't mention a soul here in this thread but eventually mentioned it in another thread when I had challenged you to note the main difference between a zygote and an unfertilized egg that is critical to you. Otherwise, your arguements mostly revolved around proclamations. As for your claim that we are changing the definition of the word human in human rights to suit our purpose, I would claim that this is what you are doing, not us. The only time I had heard the term ""human rights"" applied to embryos is by you. Though I haven't read the entire declaration of human rights, it mostly seems to address rights to protect people from cruel treatment. I don't think it really addresses property rights, rights of dependents, etc. So, though it might pertain to the rights of children from violence, slavery, etc., it will not address whether the child can have property rights to, say, its Sony Playstation ... Basically, the UN addresses ""human rights"" (where that term usually refers to the more basic of rights against cruel treatment) not ALL rights - most rights are up to the constitutent countries. It appeals to a common sense of empathy that most humans have. The existence of a sense of empathy in nearly all humans (except for psycopaths) makes it not arbitrary. Most of us were brought up with a morality that involved thinking about how our actions will effect others - where empathy played the main role in those moral decisions. For the core rights to life, I would not disccriminate against level of mental development but would discriminate based on whether there is any mind at all. I simply would not give rights to bodies. Recognizing that there is an ""I"" (which I understand is the concept of self-awareness) is different than being developed enough to experience everything that comes along with being an individual mentally existing being - the emotions and/or thoughts, the perception of pain or other senses, etc. Again, the importance I place on mind for having a right to life is not in a more highly developed mind but any mind to begin with. That mind doesn't have to recognize itself in order to exist. Most animals may not have self-awareness, but they have emotions, a sense of pain, etc. I was hoping to avoid that by jumping to the core of the arguement - i.e. can the term ""human rights"" be applied to embryos. Perhaps I am jumping to assumptions, but it seemed obvious to me that the arguements about whether the definition of ""human being"" in the biological realm includes embryos were never meant to stay only within the biological realm. It was and is clear to me that everybody saw the ultimate goal of that line of reasoning. So, it was important to me to point out the illogic of that line of reasoning instead of seeing this forum go back to long, pointless, unresolved debates about definitions.","Steeeeve","302319","Don't worry about my discussions with others, the two I am talking to do not care for honest debate and you trying to justify their position is not needed. These forums. I see no evidence that the reasons mimic the appeal. Reasoning only comes from proclamations. For example you can't reason that reason exists without actually violating reason. And I think you are wrong because you are already working from a different deck of cards. Hindsight can't be used when making an argument. That they are not deserving of human rights. I didn't mention in our discussion here and I am not aware of what you are referring to so please don't bring it up unless you have a reference that you are questioning. Of course, the definition has been changed for a long time. Again history has been against those that argue a human is not deserving of human rights. Aren't we talking about human rights? I'm ok with no granting an embryo the right to vote. So are their different levels of human rights now? That is still arbitrary because you never established a connection between empathy and morality where empathy is the reason for morality. brain waves begin rather early. Do you discriminate now? if that is self-awareness then I am pretty sure that develops after birth. This is what you care about...you have no idea what they are thinking or care to discuss. I don't mind you jumping in but don't take my use of words out of the context they were in. It was my goal too see how foolish some members of this forum are. It was clear there was not going to be an intelligent debate on the actual matters. For this reason there was no need for you to try and ""right the ship"" because the point wasn't what you thought.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","02:42 PM","abortion-debates","221"
