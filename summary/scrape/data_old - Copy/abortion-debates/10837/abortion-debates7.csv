The unborn does fit the definition and is therefore a human being.","lesz","300594","Really? But my definition of a human being includes the trait that it is an organism with a physically independent life. Since a foetus cannot survive outside its mother's womb, until fairly late in the pregnancy, and indeed from a biological perspective could be regarded as parasitic, I don't see how it is reasonable to regard every foetal stage as a human being the way you would regard a human infant as a human being after birth. Frankly, I think it's insane to think this way. There was no tradition, religious or otherwise, of making this absurd claim, till fundamentalist Christians got going on it and created it out of thin air. But then, that's fundamentalist Christians for you: human rights begin at conception and end at birth. After that, the kid and mother are on their own.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","09:16 AM","abortion-debates","91"
"02-07-2008","10837",7,"CUNxTime","300526","I think I'll pass, I like breathing. I honestly think that the fetus is going to be a person and it is killed in an abortion. It's just that I can't see forcing a woman to have one that doesn't want it and most likely an unwanted person is going to become a drag on society.","Steeeeve","300597","Can we kill bums?

"02-07-2008","10837",7,"electrolyte","300572","You said that blacks were not legally persons. The three-fifths clause says that you are wrong: blacks have always been persons . I never said that blacks have always been treated equally or civilly, etc. I might be able to be convinced of this, but I'm not as of yet. Why can't comparisons be made between certain things (i.e. actions) instead of being made against a standard? This seems really wishy-washy. Now, I realize that some people have no problem with things that other people find despicable, but these people are generally few and far between. If these feelings are no more than belief, why are there moral holdings that are held by the majority of people? As opposed to what? Surely not science, judging from your statement above. Religion? Why do you place it where you place it? Many universities have ethics classes in the philosophy department. Clearly I'm not the only one who thinks that this is the logical place. I must be lost. Why I should or shouldn't what? I'm trying to explore possibilities while minimizing assumptions. It seems to me that -- absent a moral absolute -- it makes more sense not to assume one. I'll explore ideas based on assumptions, though. Murder and stealing violate rights of people. Good point on animal cruelty. Let's include that in our discussion. I disagree with your reasoning. Here's an example: an email recently went around my school about the ""water fuel"" pseudoscam. Non-sciency people were getting excited until I replied with an analysis of the facts in terms of laws of thermodynamics, which shows that there's no magical fuel as implied in the distributed information. The fact that I was familiar with scientific concepts allowed me to perform an analysis that non-scientists could/would/did not. The question is whether morality depends on the people or vice versa. However, whether your morality can be justified might be better known to an ethicist than a soybean farmer.","Steeeeve","300602","Blacks were legally property. There was no legal ruling on the definition of a word just like their wasn't in Roe vs Wade. Blacks were not considered persons under the law in that they were not treated as such. If you are property you are already not treated as a person. No? Because a comparison between two things is the second step of the process. You would already have a ""good"" in mind (meaning the standard already set) and now you apply it to real life situations. I can't think of a way where good vs evil could come about that is not just pure belief. There really can't be a reason behind it because reason is more of a method and in a method you have to have a starting point . So if you are reasoning what soap to buy you ultimately go all the way back to the most fundamental belief you have (granted for soap its not really hard). In other words you can't prove your very basic starting point and thus it is belief. No I agree it is philosophy but philosophy doesn't teach one standard for ethic or morality. The purpose of philosophy is to get one to think about morality not to teach one what it is. I am saying that without a moral absolute then perhaps they should stay our of issues that don't affect them but it doesn't force them too. In fact, without the absolute standard they can do whatever because of the lack of guidance. There would be no reason to do something that affects someone else but there is also no reason not to. Random chance I guess you could say. Yes, you force morals on people because they may violate certain rights of people. But rights of people is a morality judgment so really you are forcing those morals because your morality says so. As an aside, since I believe the fetus to be a person doesn't that make it only logical that I be against abortion and force the morality on others? If you could do it for born persons there is no reason not to force that morality on non-born persons. As for animal cruelty this is just a point showing that morality is often times influencing laws and not when it affects another human. Doesn't this prove the point actually? The standard of science is what you bounced these new ideas off of and they came back saying there is no magical fuel. Ethicists and people judging morality are seeking that standard. I would argue that morality doesn't depend on the people because I can think of examples were a majority of people felt X was moral while it was clearly not and I would say it wasn't even at that time in history. I don't think so because of the reasoning I used above regarding the magic fuel.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","09:54 AM","abortion-debates","94"

They aren't physically independent of their mother; they aren't sentient and self-aware. Your liver cells meet your criteria. Oh? Really? Since when did you become such an expert on the biology of parasites? A parasite is an organism that derives its sustenance by exploiting another living organism during its life. It doesn't have to be a separate species, just a separate individual. Of course, the definition of a foetus as parasitical is a little tongue-in-cheek. It's just that the foetus is genetically distinct from its mother, and shares many of the same properties as the usual parasites, in that it's totally dependent on its living host. It's totally dependent on its mother, and therefore cannot be regarded as a separate organism with rights of its own that supersede the rights of its host. A foetus does have certain rights, but so does the mother. You lot refuse to recognise the mother has any. To you lot, every mother is no more than an incubator.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","10:06 AM","abortion-debates","97"

An entity with human dna is all that is required. Your liver is part of an entity and not an entity itself. Well using your definition (which is wrong it does have to be a different species) then you just admitted the fetus is a separate individual did you not? Dependency is not a criteria for obtaining rights. A new born is 100% dependent but they have rights. Of course you would just throw in random charges creating a fallacy and a poor argument.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","12:57 PM","abortion-debates","98"

This is discussion is not about how blacks were treated; I objected to your statement about whether blacks were ""legally"" persons . I've interpreted your statement in two ways. I'll address both interpretations, just in case my suspicion that you really mean the latter is incorrect. 1. This doesn't follow. It seems I need only compare two actions/things against each other in order to develop a system with a morality rating system, not an independent action/thing of declared value or a definition. 2. What are the implications if we use our feelings as judgement? If someone doing things for me makes me happy, perhaps that is my basis for judging those actions good. (Whether this idea stands up to scrutiny, I don't know. Let's explore.) If we base our morality on our feelings, and the vast majority of us have predictable feelings in response to certain stimuli, then it is reasonable that these responses are evolutionary in nature. After all, it does make sense that morality increases fitness of groups. Are you nuts? There are so many choices! It takes me fifteen minutes every time I have to buy more! :P If it only requires comparison without a standard, then I don't think this statement is true. If there is some evolutionary cause, then the basis is in evolutionary history. I agree. This is why I'd like somebody to address the questions in my ""Atheism and Morality"" thread. I think that an absolute lack of reason to do anything is reason not to do anything. Why get involved for no reason? What happens most of the time is that people do not feel an absolute lack of reason: In this particular example, people feel that it is right to reflect their morality upon others. If I weren't so mentally exhausted at the moment, that would probably sound less convoluted. This is intriguing. It seems we're all hypocrites. That really sucks. Or maybe I'm missing something because I'm so wiped out. I'll have to come back and revisit your post later, but I'd rather pitch in with what I can so that you can respond to my initial replies. I meant in this respect: people who have studied the material are more likely to be familiar with coherent systems of morality and common failures/fallacies even if he or she doesn't endorse any particular one. I don't think the soybean farmer has this background knowledge, much in the same way I don't have background knowledge of these things. Well, I had three responses for this, but by the time I got done typing the second, I couldn't remember the third. (1) Is morality really at the whim of the people? Are we restricted to second-guessing only in hindsight when we aren't a part of that reality? (2) Are people completely unreliable judges because of these apparent contradictions?

They were legally property. Substance over form qualifies here, just because the constitution doesn't take the time to define who is or isn't a person doesn't mean it doesn't inherently do so. It did say they were property though and that makes you not a person. How would you compare them? Don't you already have to have good and evil to decide this? If you comparing them and good and evil doesn't exist then how could you say one is good and one is evil? You can have a morality based on yourself but it leads to evil things (at least in my perspective) and basically declares yourself god. The problem with this is not that you can't do it but it doesn't hold up as a morality that can work. Many people do it though and I call it a selfish mindset. If you base your morality on your feelings then you can't say what Cho did at Virginia Tech was wrong...at least not wrong in the general. He went by his feelings and that led to evil....granted this is an extreme example. It just removes any objective standard and you wouldn't be able to convince somebody of an evil if they feel it is good. But like I said, its possible to have a morality based on this. ha, my problem is I can't find my kind of soap....its always at the bottom and deep in the shelf or something. I don't understand. Do you mean like a ""built in"" morality the evolved? Seems like an interesting thread but would take lots of thinking haha. Its a little deeper of a conversation than abortion. It would happen by random chance. Like a dice has no reason to land on 6 but it can. Yeah, this is probably true and I agree with this to some extent. No reason to rush responses. I take a long time sometimes. Lucky for you I'm sick so I haven't been at work much....which has turned out to be a really bad thing. I don't know if it is hypocritical so long as you don't hold the position that you can't force morality on others. I think you can but not to an unlimited extent because no one person is a God. So with an imperfect way to impose morality the best way to operate (according to our founders at least) would be to vote on things to some extent. Even this gets it wrong though. Perhaps they wouldn't be better arguing about it. (1) I'd argue that morality is not at the whim of the people but rather is an outside standard by which we should try to achieve. The problem is morality in the law is at the whim of the people which is really how a lot of it is enforced. (2) I'd argue people are flawed and are unreliable. Which begs the question about how you can trust what I'm saying now haha.
