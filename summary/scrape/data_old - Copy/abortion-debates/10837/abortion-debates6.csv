Comments like these are the ones that really make me wonder if you're as familiar with debate as you've claimed to be. A soybean farmer is not an authority on ethics. An ethicist is.

"02-05-2008","10837",6,"Dane","300283","Correct. ""Person"" is a legal designation. But it didn't override Section IX of the Roe vs Wade decision. So your claim of fetal personhood remains an outright lie. The law stated no such thing. Please provide documentation for you lie. Really? How is a member of a species defined? You don't know? Then perhaps your claim is a bit premature and based on ignorance, eh!!! Exactly, Dred Scott was a decision about citizenship, not personhood like you falsely claimed. I never said it didn't, your lie none withstanding. Your claim was about being a person. Clearly the Dred Scott decision did NOT claim slaves and African-Americans not to be persons. So your claim is false. Nope, I didn't claim that either. But since you are on that topic, certainly the fetus carries out a PARASITIC FUNCTION in the woman. You can not deny that and be honest. What does that have to do with anything? the issue was the word ""person."" I can only assume that your evasive rhetorics and revisionist linguistics is an attempt at not admitting that you were wrong. Your surrender is accepted. Huh? Could you clarify?","Steeeeve","300304","Person can be a legal designation but it doesn't have to be and certainly isn't when referencing human rights. Blacks were not ""persons"" legally but I maintain they were always persons and always deserving of human rights. I'd hope you'd agree. And for the record, it is obvious that ""person"" in the 14th amendment did not cover the human fetus. This is all the court claimed of which none of it matters because person is not just a legal term. They were property for one, thought of as inferior for 2, and the constitution declared them 3/5ths of a person. For you to even deny that blacks weren't treated as persons under the law in the 1800s is a remarkable rewrite of history and dangerous. There you go answering questions again..... The fetus is a member of the human species. Get over it. All that is needed to be a member of a species is an entity with its own DNA if functioning systems. Again, you already acknowledged this by calling the fetus a parasite thus implying it was actually a different species. They were denied citizenship because they were inferior persons and property... are you actually going to sit here and tell me blacks were treated as persons in the 1800s? It certainly did. It claimed they were inferior. Why wouldn't it be? You already have denied it because a parasite has to be of a different species and you claim no species. You seem to think the law is everything so if the law defined a fetus or embryo as human (or person if you prefer) then does this make it so? Hahahaha, you are no different then the dozens of others than have come in here rambling off inconsistent notions that have no basis in reality or logic. You seem to be of the impression that if the courts or the law say it then it has to be true. So were blacks ever just property and inferior to the white man?","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","09:15 AM","abortion-debates","77"

Since this is not the case (to some extent) and it is all based on belief then the soybean farmer is just as relevant in the discussion as the ethicist. An ethicist has no better judgment on abortion than the soybean farmer. An ethicist has no better judgment on right vs wrong than the soybean farmer. That should have said ""are not"". So it should have read: ""Moral decisions are NOT decided by a certain group of people unless you can establish an absolute moral right that only they know."" Without that ""not"" it really makes no sense. I do argue it exists but I also argue that there aren't certain people that can ""know"" it better. It is a belief structure. I would say an appeal to an ethicist is an incorrect appeal to authority because they have no authority to decide right vs wrong.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","09:23 AM","abortion-debates","78"

"02-05-2008","10837",6,"None","None","None","CUNxTime","300311","I have to say I don't think that the abortion debate will ever be solved because there is no way to compromise. People who want to shut down the clinics see abortion as murder, plain and simple. I tend to think it would be impossible for someone to compromise on that if that is what they truly believe. People who believe that a woman should be able to chose to terminate will never concede the control of their own bodies. What's the answer? I think the status quo is. Women should have the choice as to whether they carry a baby to term. The last thing we need is MORE unwanted people crowding the planet. However, I think it's important that there be some opposition to it. The opposition brings a sort of humanization to the situation that causes people to think it over and performs a 'moral grounding'. I mean, we don't want to discard life to easily... Just a thought.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","10:27 AM","abortion-debates","80"

Which is precisely why the choice to continue or terminate a pregnancy must be left to the unfetterd decision of the woman herself - which is exactly what Mr. Justice Blackmun stated in RvW.

It is about rights and therefore about the law. Hmm, backpedaling. Yes, they were always persons and due human rights. So when you make claims about ""rights"" of a fetus as a person, then you know you are lying. Thanks for that admission. Not affecting their personhood despite your claim. False. The 3/5th designation was strictly a census designation but then that's not what I stated, your lie none withstanding. So your false accusation is irrelevant to this discussion. Again, how are members of a species defined? But then if you want to call an embryo an ""entity,"" then you have to do the same for a hydatidiform mole. Are you going to claim the hydatidiform mole to be a human being? Your unique and unworking definition has nothing to do with science. I am not calling the fetus a parasite, your lies none withstanding. I'm saying that the law did not declare African-Americans to not be persons, regardless of your claim that it did. But made no claim that they were not persons. In fact, when you read the Dred Scott decision, it mentions Scott as a person. Didn't you read it? Here you are, check it yourself: http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/script...l=60&invol=393 I have not, you are again lying. The law is everything in the area of rights and legal issues. Human would be a biological issue, but yes if the law defined an embryo and fetus as persons, then they would be persons. You need to talk back to the mirror.

"02-06-2008","10837",6,"electrolyte","300419","The three-fifths clause declared them ""persons."" There we go again, we crazy liberals ""rewriting"" history by citing the Constitution. One could say the same about any science. We technically accept nothing as infallible, but that doesn't mean that we accept what Joe Schmo off the street says about quantum physics. I question the assertion that ethics is ""all based on belief."" Let us suppose that this statement is true, but that no absolute morality has been established. Why, then, should Washington bigwigs have any moral authority regarding issues that don't affect them? Why shouldn't the decisions be made by those people the decisions actually effect? Which sounds to me like an argument that Mr. Washington Bigwig shouldn't force their moral decisions upon the populace (e.g. stem cell research, abortion). A scientist doesn't ""decide"" what is right or wrong, but a scientist has examined the evidence and comes to a reasoned decision based on more extensive knowledge than the soybean farmer. The same could be said for ethicists and ethics.","Steeeeve","300451","Are you trying to tell me the constitution treated blacks like persons? Are we really having this conversation? morality is not a science and science does have a standard by which to judge. It is impossible to prove something is good unless you have a standard by which to judge good and evil. This standard can be nothing more than belief. I think it would be hard to show otherwise. Why do you think morality falls under philosophy? Assuming no moral absolute? If you assume this then there is no reason why you should or shouldn't. Murder, stealing, animal cruelty. Those too. using phrasing like ""Mr. Washington BigWig"" is borderlining on a logical fallacy by tainting the water. A scientist has a standard by which to judge...the ethicist does not unless the ethicist has concluded a moral standard and if there is a moral standard then the soybean farmer would still have just as much room to talk on the matter. The reasons for this are vast but in short, morality is not an observation or investigation. Morality is the conduct of the people to right and wrong. I can take this one further as well and say my morality by definition would not be known (or have the ability to be known) more to an ethicist than to a soybean farmer.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","09:01 AM","abortion-debates","86"

If so then if a right doesn't exist how can one say they have a right to something? How is that backpedaling? And how can you say they were due human rights when the law didn't say so? And if they were always persons and the law didn't treat them as such then how were they persons if the law is the only thing that defines this (as you seem to think)? You are all over the place it seems. Rights are not given by the law. I agree, the law and the way the law treats someone does not affect their personhood. Now apply that to an unborn baby and you see that personhood does not get defined by just the law. And roe v. wade was only referring to the original meaning of the 14th amendment. So it was not an overall view. Then what do you state? Were blacks treated as equal persons under the law in the 1800s? If not, then explain why they were still persons if the law didn't say so. Answered in the last post. Why are you scared to answer? Because you know the human embryo and fetus is a human being? Fallacy aside, that does not fit the definition so no. The unborn does fit the definition and is therefore a human being. You just did in the last post Roe vs. Wade never declared an unborn not to be a person...just not a person in terms of the 14th amendment. So were blacks inferior beings in the 1800s? You haven't claimed no species? Then what species is the unborn? Only to a fool. So if the law changes then you'd be against abortion? Human being is a biological issue and it just so happens the unborn is defined as a human being (no surprise). And you agree with this? Perhaps I should start counting how many times you use the word ""lie"" (or variation) in your posts. The good thing about this is that it gives me an idea of who I am posting too. It is funny how certain age groups act the same and we have had many folks post exactly like how you do.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","09:20 AM","abortion-debates","87"

I honestly think that the fetus is going to be a person and it is killed in an abortion. It's just that I can't see forcing a woman to have one that doesn't want it and most likely an unwanted person is going to become a drag on society. When my Crazy A%s ex-girlfriend got pregnant, she insisted on having an abortion, I begged her not to but I couldn't convince her not too. She eventually went completely off the deep end and I finally got away from her (that's why I moved down here) and now I'm married to a great girl and not chained to the old one, so in the long run, I'm glad she had that choice. As to the question of rights and the law, I believe there are certain rights that should exist for a thinking, feeling, sentient being REGARDLESS of the laws. I can't get behind the 'Cultural Relativism' argument stating that all cultures are equal and etc... Look at Fundamental Islamic countries, the LAW states that if a woman gets raped or commits adultery or has sex before marriage-- she should be buried up to her head and rocks thrown at her until she's dead. Now that's the Law. I would say that the law goes against Natural Inherent Rights that should exist for people, IN SPITE of the law...","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","05:40 PM","abortion-debates","89"

The three-fifths clause says that you are wrong: blacks have always been persons . I never said that blacks have always been treated equally or civilly, etc. I think you're right, but I'd like to explore these aspects. I might be able to be convinced of this, but I'm not as of yet. Why can't comparisons be made between certain things (i.e. actions) instead of being made against a standard? This seems really wishy-washy. Now, I realize that some people have no problem with things that other people find despicable, but these people are generally few and far between. If these feelings are no more than belief, why are there moral holdings that are held by the majority of people? As opposed to what? Surely not science, judging from your statement above. Religion? Why do you place it where you place it? Many universities have ethics classes in the philosophy department. Clearly I'm not the only one who thinks that this is the logical place. I must be lost. Why I should or shouldn't what? I'm trying to explore possibilities while minimizing assumptions. It seems to me that -- absent a moral absolute -- it makes more sense not to assume one. I'll explore ideas based on assumptions, though. Murder and stealing violate rights of people. Good point on animal cruelty. Let's include that in our discussion. Point taken. I disagree with your reasoning. Here's an example: an email recently went around my school about the ""water fuel"" pseudoscam. Non-sciency people were getting excited until I replied with an analysis of the facts in terms of laws of thermodynamics, which shows that there's no magical fuel as implied in the distributed information. The fact that I was familiar with scientific concepts allowed me to perform an analysis that non-scientists could/would/did not. Again, I tend to agree with this simple statement, but it's worth discussing. The question is whether morality depends on the people or vice versa. Your personal morality is not really what I'm interested in. Whether somebody knows your morality has no bearing on whether you are actually ""good."" However, whether your morality can be justified might be better known to an ethicist than a soybean farmer.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","10:47 PM","abortion-debates","90"
