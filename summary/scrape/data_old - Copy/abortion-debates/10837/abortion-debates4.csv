When I find your views and actions not to be ""moral"" does that give me the right to restrict your rights and your control over your own body? If I think you should give your kidney to somebody dying from kidney failure, should I be able to force you to do so, because I find your reluctance to not be moral? There still isn't a ""someone,"" no individual human being, your emotional histrionics none withstanding. By having an abortion or carrying to term. hence, it is the woman's CHOICE. So you are saying that all emergency rooms should be shut down? That nobody should ever be treated for heart attacks and other events directly resulting from choices in how you live? You are seeking to control another person's body You are trying to enslave them regardless of what cowardly argument you are trying for in avoiding to admit to it. An embryo or a fetus. Didn't you know? You can't possibly be THAT ignorant about this issue when you are trying to debate it, can you","Steeeeve","300044","And because I said so works for you? An individual is often defined as a single person. The fetus is a unique single person. I don't know why you need to use semantics to make your argument. Perhaps to sleep better at night? Yes. If you feel that is what is moral then shouldn't you be pushing for that? Because you said so right haha. and it shouldn't be a choice. You should not have the choice to end someone elses life. The consequence is the pregnancy and creation of another life. You never have a choice to end up someones life for convenience of yourself. The heart attack is the consequence of how they lived. You don't have a choice but to live with that consequence...including paying the bill. I'm seeking to prevent the killing of a person's body actually. If preventing someone from being murdered is cowardly and enslaving then I choose that. Your arguments are no better than the slave holders of the 1800s. Sometimes called a baby as well. I didn't realize you had to use semantics to rationalize your position.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","02:04 PM","abortion-debates","46"
"02-03-2008","10837",4,"Ghost Rider","300026","You know, I was going to go off on a tangent and talk about how I was going to contact every female legislator I can find and try to convince them to introduce and sign onto as sponsors, a bill that would make it a federal offense for any man to abadon any child or potential child he might have. But it would be so vaguely worded that it would criminalize masturbation since every sperm has the potential to become a child. I still believe it, but I'm gonna use a different argument. I wonder how many men are really in support of a ban on abortion. How many of you scumbags that have some side-whore that you f**k when the wife isn't looking or not in the mood, would be in favor of a law that would make it impossible for your side-whore to have an abortion if you got her pregnant? That'd be lovely for you wouldn't it, having to support two families now.","Steeeeve","300047","If there was a bill that forced the father of a child to care for the baby (unless adoption is the case) then I'd sign it or vote for it.

"02-03-2008","10837",4,"electrolyte","300045","Just as ""atheist"" can be used to describe an immoral person? Some dictionaries include these types of things because these meanings are used in the vernacular, not because they are particularly accurate. Whether the fetus's individuality is a part of reality is what is being debated. And I think that there is no more merit to a bunch of lawyers making these decisions instead of ethicists and the people directly impacted and/or doctors. Should we poll a bunch of soybean farmers to determine whether you should have your spleen removed, or whether 10000 shares of Google at $150 apiece is a good buy?","Steeeeve","300048","I've never heard the term atheist being used in that context. You aren't showing its not an accurate term to use. There is no win in semantic arguments anyway. I don't care if you call the unborn baby a fetus, embryo, or whatever so long as you use a proper definition of a word. In my case I have. You don't get to decide what is being debating between myself and another person on this forum. If those are moral questions then the soybean farmer is just as equipped to answer as anyone else. They happen to not be moral questions though.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","02:12 PM","abortion-debates","49"

Unborn people = Oxymoron. Does the census count fetuses as people? The state should have no more say over what choices a woman makes about the future of her pregnancy that it should about whether or not she should remove a cancerous tumor or a ruptured appendix.

Sure it should. And the laws agree with my point. So your ""shouldn't"" wishful thinking only exists inside your misogynistic mind. The only legal issue about ""someone elses life"" really is regarding the death penalty. The fetus is a thing, not a ""someone."" Just like the consequence of eating to many burgers and not exercise is likely heart disease. So we should quit treating heart disease because it counteracts ""consequences"" of people's actions? Your distasteful attempt at oppressing and controlling women aside, your punitive beliefs have no business in the US. Utterly irrelevant. The embryo or fetus is not ""someone,"" your revisionist linguistic hyperbole none withstanding So you ARE saying that we should deny people treatment for heart attacks, then. You truly are demonstrating how extremely out of touch with society that you are. Irrelevant to the current discussion as the embryo is not a person.

"02-03-2008","10837",4,"electrolyte","300093","Either dictionaries are updating their entries to be more correct, or (more likely) I'm remembering incorrectly. Here's the definition I find for ""godless"": The fact that I am an atheist (and therefore ""godless"") in no way means that I am wicked or immoral, but enough bigoted jackasses use the word that way that the dictionaries include that ""meaning"" (in the same way that the pronunciation of the word ""nuclear"" includes the variant ""nucueler"" because enough scientifically illiterate people say it that way). If that's true, then you've expanded the definition of ""baby"" so wide that the statement ""it is immoral to kill a baby"" is not an absolute. It's like saying that the word really is ""nucueler"" because we're discussing changes in nucules (or even new cules). Gee, Steeeeve, if you want to muzzle everyone, go talk to admin. Or you could start a closed formal debate with a single opponent. But these are the open forums, and I get to pitch in if I so desire. Worst case, address our arguments separately.

You have to take a definition of atheist and then define a word in that definition to come up with that. I personally wouldn't find that to be an accurate definition but you can use it if you want.

Why don't you follow your own advice sometime. You are full of contradictions and you just joined this forum. You don't have to respond to me. You pass the law and I'm there. Good job answering your own questions by the way. Do you even need me for this conversation? I've got a pretty good feeling you have no knowledge of the US constitution. Pushing morals is not against the constitution. In fact, the constitution removes nothing from the democratic process. Just like how blacks weren't people. Very racist of you. the fetus is a human being...Do you think human beings are ""things""? Do you think blacks are ""things""? That was the argument used in the 1800s...are you saying it is valid? I guess I'm glad we finally settled that issue right or I might be in trouble thanks to people like you. So why do you feel it is ok to rank some humans as more important than others? The consequence of sex can be pregnancy and the consequence of eating too many burgers is heart disease. The way you deal with that consequence should not be to kill another human...in either case. Very relevant. What species is the fetus you speak of? Actually, I'm saying your analogies are idiotic because you create a strawman argument. Reported ""because you said so"" right? Do you support calling blacks non-persons? Why can't you just answer the questions.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","12:12 AM","abortion-debates","57"

One could also so that a born baby can't survive on their own either. To your point it is irrelevant but in the event of life threatening you have to save the life you can. I have a problem with you using logical fallacies. I don't buy the argument that the only way to not be depressed is to kill another. So you admit there are two people? Why not? If the embryo/fetus/baby/or whatever you call him/her is not valued then why not support abortion whenever for whatever reason. The only reason you would not support it always is if there is some value. The only reason justified is life threatened of the mother. I grant that rape and incest are not easy to deal with. You answer those by saying you don't punish the life of one for the crime of another. Actualy I have: http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...3&postcount=37 Check the second link...which was posted to you upon your request. There are no stats on braindead or suffer horrible birth defects but assuming any possible problem with the baby called ""fetal health"" then it ranges from 2-3%.

"02-04-2008","10837",4,"Ghost Rider","300002","There's still nothing on the Federal level, so a state law can be rather moot in the discussion. Any act that results in death? So a woman tripping and falling flat on her stomach and suffering a miscarriage would result in charges of murder?","lesz","300119","I don't believe that federal law has as yet criminalised the harming of a foetus without the mother's consent, but I can't see any constitutional reason why they couldn't do it, for cases over which they have jurisdiction, anyway. All I was really pointing out is that there already is legal precedent for criminalising actions that injure a foetus against the mother's will, and such laws do not appear to be unconstitutional to the courts that have dealt with them. Bear in mind there is a distinction between a doctor who performs an abortion at the mother's request, or to save the life of the mother, and someone who criminally injures the mother and so kills the foetus. If legislators see fit to bring additional penalties for such an action, I can't see that they are acting unconstitutionally. No, of course not. There is a recognised legal and moral distinction between death by accident and deliberate homicide. Or feticide, whatever. If an assailant so injures a woman that she loses the child she wanted, then that is a serious additional injury to her that the law can legitimately take into consideration. Please note, I am not arguing for making elective abortion illegal, just pointing out that the situation is fairly complex.","whether-you-agree-not-its-dark-truth","06:18 AM","abortion-debates","60"
