It would certainly be an interesting cross sectional study to look at the incidence. I would think it would be very difficult for someone who has had an abortion, fathered an aborted child, or is very close to someone that has to step back from that experience and look at the arguments in an unbiased way.

Whether it is or isn't true, it is completely irrelevant. Again, this has absolutely nothing to do with the validity of anyone's arguments. I'm glad you understand that, but when we start to introduce all of this speculation it distracts us from the valid points being made. I don't go around asking pro-lifers ""have you ever been raped? Do you know what its like to carry a rapist's child inside of you?"" for the exact same reason. These types of arguments are fallacies that distract us from the debate.

I personally know three women who have had abortions. In my opinion, one definately made the correct choice, one did not, and one abuses the procedure and disgusts me. However, I was well established in my opinion of being pro-choice before any of them had an abortion. As to why I am pro-choice - - - I was taught to be. My grandmother raised 11 kids in a one room shack with an abusive husband who wouldn't work during a time she could not get birth control without his permission (which he would not grant), spousal rape was legal (she could not say ""no""), and divorce was unheard of. Once my grandfather died she VOLUNTEERED in a woman's health clinic that, in addition to many types of services, offered abortion. My mother had a very difficult third pregnancy, was in her 30s and decided she wanted no more children. She could not get her tubes tied without my father's consent, something he only granted after her sympathetic doctor lied to him about the health risks of further pregnancies to her. This same man walked out on his children ten years later. My body and all choices regarding it are MINE and mine alone. Without exception. These stories are part of why Easy's canned and callous ""All pro-choicers have one thing in common, they're mothers chose life"" comment enfuriates. He neglects to realize that until very recently women had little to no choice in reproductive matters at all - especially those that were married. But rest assured, I have had no abortion and have taken all needed precautions. (Am single, celibate, ""fixed"", and would just as soon throw myself off a tall cliff as clutter my life up with some fella.)","pro-choice-roots","09:21 AM","abortion-debates","9"

"03-20-2010","14010",4,"Archangel","395382","How open minded of you. If a woman chooses to murder her unborn child, you approve of it. Forget about defending an innocent human being when a woman's choice to kill it is the other option to consider. You keep repeating your lie as if it's true, but it isn't true. An unborn human being is no more a parasite than any other type of mammal which shares a common type of gestation in order to develop into its kind of creature. A parasite is a foreign body which intrudes upon a healthy host and leaves that host either weaker or dead since it literally consumes it as it feeds upon it. And that parasite never grows into the host which it is infecting. I posted a link which explains what a parasite is yet you continue to misrepresent them. Are you ignorant or just stubborn? And see the last bolded sentence? Apply that statement to the unborn baby you are promoting the death of if its mother chooses to be selfish and kills it for the sake of her personal convenience. I don't blame the Jews, as in the Jewish people, for Jesus death at all. Crucifixion was a Roman form of execution in case you didn't know it. I do blame the religious hypocrites who called for his death since He was totally innocent of any crime at all, much less one worthy of death. But the Jews didn't have the legal authority to execute anyone which is why they took Him before Pilate and the Herod with their false accusations. You are guilty of applying the same fallacious arguments as all atheists in that you attempt to indict all christians for the past crimes of the catholic church throughout its early history. You will find that I'm not an apologist for the church or men who claim religion in any way. I defend Christ only since only He is worthy of Praise and Glory due to His perfect sacrifice for us in order to redeem Humanity from our fallen state. Remember that Jesus prayed ""Father forgive them for they know not what they do,"" so if He forgave His murderers who were contemporaries at the time, who am I to condemn all Jews today?

And Jesus said to him, ""It is as you say."" Mat 27:12 And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He did not answer. Mat 27:13 Then Pilate said to Him, ""Do You not hear how many things they testify against You?""

Mat 27:15 Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the people [fn] any one prisoner whom they wanted. Mat 27:16 At that time they were holding a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas. Mat 27:17 So when the people gathered together, Pilate said to them, ""Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"" Mat 27:18 For he knew that because of envy they had handed Him over. Mat 27:19 While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, ""Have nothing to do with that righteous Man; for last [fn] night I suffered greatly in a dream because of Him."" Mat 27:20 But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to put Jesus to death. Mat 27:21 But the governor said [fn] to them, ""Which of the two do you want me to release for you?"" And they said, ""Barabbas."" Mat 27:22 Pilate said to them, ""Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?"" They all said, ""Crucify [fn] Him!"" Mat 27:23 And he said, ""Why, what evil has He done?"" But they kept shouting all the more, saying, ""Crucify [fn] Him!"" Mat 27:24 When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, ""I am innocent of this Man's blood; see to that yourselves."" Mat 27:25 And all the people said, ""His blood shall be on us and on our children!"" As you can see, it wasn't Pilate's will that Jesus be crucified but was the will of the Chief Priests who stoked up the people against Jesus and even were willing to take the consequences of choosing a convicted murderer like Barabbas to be ""freed"" in place of the promised Messiah, upon their own heads and the heads of their children.

"03-22-2010","14010",6,"None","None","None","Easyrider","395648","The recent passage of the Democrat Health Care bill identified, once and for all, which political party cannot be trusted with the lives of Americas most helpless individuals the innocent unborn. Since Roe vs. Wade, and for the last forty-plus years, spiritually-challenged Democrats have sacrificed on the altars of political correctness and convenience, the lives of some 50 million future American citizens, teachers, scientists, health care professionals, and taxpayers enough souls to actually fund, in full, the Pelosi Reid and Obama Health Care bill. And while many Republicans and Independents over the decades have likewise abrogated their moral responsibilities to the unborn, their moral turpitude pales in comparison to the left wing Capitol Hill Butchers and their like-minded constituents. On Sunday, March 21, 2010, when supposed pro-life Michigan Representative Bart Stupak and company abrogated their personal responsibilities and duty to protect the unborn, and shamefully transferred that obligation into the hands of a pro-infanticide serial prevaricator by the name of Barack Obama, the fate of the unborn was sealed. Barack Obama: Abortion-Enabler-in-Chief Barack Obama the most prolific, pro-infanticide president in American history says that abortions need to be more rare. If theres nothing wrong with abortion, then why do they need to be more rare? Mr. President? And if there is something wrong with abortion, then why isnt the Abortion-Enabler-in-Chief pro life? Can anybody answer that? Michelle Obama, can you answer that for your spiritually challenged husband? Besides apologizing for America, what did they teach you in that church you attended for the last twenty years? Did they ever teach you what the Word of God says about abortion? Did you ever crack open your Bibles and read them with the same diligence and thoroughness as Saul Alinskys Rules for Radicals? And if you did read it, why havent you taken it seriously? What does the Bible say about abortion? And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she has a miscarriage, yet there is no further injury, he shall surely be fined as the womans husband may demand of him; and he shall pay as the judges decide. But if there is further injury, then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life. (Exodus 21:22-23) Straight from the Jewish Torah, God immediately confirms the value of human life in a mothers womb for Jews and Christians alike. Next, life in the womb according to Gods divine plan: Jeremiah 1:5 Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations. Psalm 139:13 For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mothers womb. Of course, the question here is: What divine insight does the pro-abortion crowd think they have to where they can destroy in a mothers womb that which God is somehow instrumental in creating? Mr. President? Michelle Obama? Anyone? That was a future prophet to the nations in the womb. And the pro-infanticide crowd wants to pretend that instead of a baby with a divine plan, its nothing more than an unviable tissue mass. Are you kidding? Well, God is not fooled. Infanticide down through the Ages When Moses the Lawgiver was expected, they killed the babies (Exodus chapter 1). When Jesus was born, King Herod ordered the babies to be killed again (Matthew chapter 2). And now that the Lords return is imminent, the Butchers of Capitol Hill are again working unabashedly to extinguish the lives of the innocent. The fact is that God has a plan for everyone, no matter how insignificant they may appear to be. The Bible is full of personal accounts of people who trusted in God, and who then went on to achieve great things. God respects life. We should also. Now, a question for the Obama Christian and Jewish sycophants: Why did you vote for and support a man who condones, defends, and enables the horrendous, unbiblical act of genocide against the innocent unborn? Is that not one of the most grievous practices in the whole universe to rip apart the innocent unborn in a mothers womb? And you feel proud about that man? And yourselves? Let me give you a clue: Youre part of the problem for supporting him. You too have blood on your hands. And Im guessing youre probably too prideful to repent of it and change your thinking. I have more respect for the secular humanists and the bloody Viet Cong of the Vietnam war than I do the black, white, and Hispanic (etc.) Christians and Jews who voted for the Abortion-Enabler-in-Chief. The secularists generally dont know right from wrong in this instance, but the Obama Christians and Jews should know better. But what about the right of the mother to have dominion over her own body, you ask? To that I ask, What about the right to life of the innocent baby in that mothers womb? Who is its champion? The fact is that you dont kill an innocent baby for the sins or personal convenience of the parent or parents. You have a greater responsibility than that. If the mother is ill, then try to save the baby. If not, pray to God for the answer. And so today, the slaughter continues. A presidential directive will not stop the flow of abortions for long, if at all. Another president can come in and quickly reverse the directive. Or more likely, people will point to the fact that the Health bill, as law, trumps the power of a presidential directive, and will ignore Obamas initiative altogether. If Obama thought highly of the innocent unborn, hed veto the bill and do it over. And if Stupak and Company had any lasting moral character to begin with, they wouldnt have let things get this far. America, we need to reverse course and protect and respect the innocent unborn. Theres no other way around it. For the God who established America can darn well take our country from us and bring divine Judgment to our shores. Dont think he wont. We are treading on very thin ice and there surely will be a personal and national price to pay for our continued, callous disregard of innocent life. America, repent and turn from your ungodly ways before its too late. And in November, vote the Butchers of Capitol Hill the hell out of office, and anyone who looks like them.

Chemical castration drugs I could understand, but making it ok for convicted sex offenders to get free viagra shows clearly the level of intelligence and moral oversight these people retain. They also voted down an amendment by Grassley which would have forced Obama and Congress to own the same healthcare bill they passed for us and of course it was defeated the the ungodly hypocrite majority who refuses to be locked into what they feel is good enough for the surf class they are creating with this debacle of a bill. Oh, the Senate also voted to preserve all of the sweetheart and backroom deals which Obama promised had been taken out before the House came up with their sham of a vote to go against the will of ""we the people"" once again. Senate Democrats rejected an amendment last night offered by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) that would have required the President, Vice President, cabinet members, top White House staff, and the congressional leadership and committee staff who drafted the proposal to purchase their health insurance through the government exchanges like everyone else. As a result, President Obama will not have to live under the Obama healthcare reforms, and neither will the congressional staff who helped to write the overhaul, Grassley said. The message to the people at the grassroots is that its good enough for you, but not for us. Senate Democrats also voted 57-42 in favor of providing Viagra to sex offenders and 54-43 to give a ringing endorsement of the backroom, sweetheart deals for individual states such as Louisiana that remain in the bill. (I single out Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisianas $300 million sweetheart deal simply because of the prime comic relief afforded by her attempts to defend her actions from the Senate floor.)

Unless God did a hell of a clean up job, a literal flood would've left some serious evidence (besides the Grand Canyon). I don't know if the big bang actually happened, and I have no recollection of ever saying the big bang was true. But, there is evidence that suggests the Bing Bang did happen, but there is NO evidence that suggests the world was created in spontaneously in 7 days. That's true, which is why I don't buy into it. Faith shouldn't be a punishment-reward type of thing. The ""heaven"" and ""hell"" philosophy is undeniable proof that much of your religion came from the ""shallow imaginings of man"". Punishment and rewards are flawed concepts created by flawed humans. There is no way in hell that a loving, omnipotent God would use a concept that is both flawed and human in nature. I would be a lot more sympathetic to your religion had it not created a place like hell, where all the ""bad people"" go. It doesn't matter who you are. Using fear as a means of control is not right, and not like a loving God. Throw Hell and believing literally in the bible out the window, and I could actually see myself as somewhat of a Christian.","Archangel","396310","You prove how low and how arbitrary your actual standard of proof is when you make statements like this. If evidence serves your agenda then you accept it as rational, otherwise you reject it as bogus. And you think the Grand Canyon is the only evidence of Noah's Flood? The global flood catastrophe is one of the key facts of all history. Not only is there a mass of geological evidence,it has left an indelible impression on the memory of the entire human race. An analysis of some 600 individual flood traditions reveals a widespread concurrence on essential points: the prior corruption of mankind, a flood warning unheeded by the masses, a survival vessel, the preservation of up to eight people with representative animal life, the sending forth of a bird to determine the suitability of reemerging land, significance in the rainbow, descent from a mountain, and the re-population of the whole earth from a single group of survivors. Especially remarkable is the persistence of that biblical name Noah. And this is particularly so when you consider the ultimate language differences between peoples, and the extreme local distortions which (developed in flood legends. Yet the name survived virtually unchanged in such isolated places as Hawaii (where he was called Nu-u), the Sudan (Nuh), China (Nu-Wah), the Amazon region (Noa), Phrygia (Noe) and among the Hottentots (Noh and Hiagnoh). : SUDDEN APPEARANCE: Are you aware that ""ALL CULTURES BEGAN SUDDENLY"" and were fully developed? A long preliminary period is not supported by archaeology. Before cities on earth, there was nothing. There was no transition whatsoever between the ancient civilizations and any primitive forebearers. They were at their peak from the beginning. : ...Great cities, enormous temples, pyramids of overwhelming size. Colossal statues with tremendous expressive power. Luxurious tunnels and tombs. Splendid streets flanked by magnificent sculpture, perfect drainage systems. A decimal system at the very start. A ready-made writing, already perfected. A well established naming system (in which each Pharaoh had as many as five names). Society already divided into specialist classes. An army, civil service and hierarchy minutely organized. A court exhibiting all the indications of well-defined precedence and form. Egypt came from a clearly established civilization. The only conclusions that can be drawn from the evidence is that,1 Each of the first civilizations appeared suddenly, already fully developed. 2) That a connection existed between them. 3) Their footprints led back to the Middle East mountains where Noah and his family left the Ark. : The sudden appearance of civilization is itself a memorial to history's one great catastrophe. More importantly, the flood is a historical event of tremendous testimonial importance to modern man...... : You have no idea if it happened yet you have never opposed those who have defended it as a rational theory, and you also defend it as rational right here. But it is an imagined 15 BILLION year distant event which cannot be proven at all yet you accept it as rational. That is my point and it is undeniable that your as inconsistent in your world view in your condemnation of the bibles explanation as one can be. This is totally your opinion which makes clear that you don't like the idea that you will be held responsible for rejecting the savior who died for your sins. God makes it clear that you don't have to accept His offer of salvation but don't accuse him of not existing just because you reject His TRUTH. And be sure that in the end, His truth will be the only truth that matters and your rejection of it will feel as foolish to you then as it appears to me now.

Liberal Fundamentalism Someone once said to beware of zealots. Yet Jesus Christ was a zealot for the ways of God, and Mother Theresa was certainly a zealot for helping the sick and needy. Being a zealot, then, is not automatically a prescription for hated. Likewise, religious fundamentalism. One can certainly believe in the fundamental teachings of Jesus Christ and Biblical values, practice them, and not be a threat to society or ones neighbors. On the other hand, theres a new and particularly pernicious brand of fundamentalism making the rounds in America today liberal fundamentalism. Liberal Fundamentalism is a failed and destructive philosophical enterprise, replete with a host of anti-Biblical, pseudo-religious doctrines that seeks to elevate the ways and wisdom of man above the wisdom and desires of God. Its principle aim is the sacking of traditional Judaic and Christian values and beliefs, which are revisited through suspect liberal scholarship or politically-correct dogma in an effort to replace them with the tenets of carnal moral hedonism and the failed social doctrines of todays liberal elitists. The genesis of todays liberal fundamentalists was the anti-traditionalist hedonists of the 1960's and 70's. They advocated fornication and free-love, illegal substance abuse, moral relativism, contempt for authority, and they enjoyed a prosperous America founded on the very hard work and enterprise they sought to distance themselves from. The freedoms they enjoyed were purchased by the blood, sweat and personal sacrifices of the very forefathers they held in contempt. Personal responsibility, self-restraint and self-sacrifice are often foreign concepts to them. Right and wrong, and good and evil were arbitrarily revisited, for such concepts had no objective meaning to them. They had no objective rationality for their hedonistic philosophy other than if it feels good, lets do it. The only righteous cause that qualified for support in their progressive mindset was the undermining and revising of traditional American and Judeo-Christian values. They said not to trust anyone ""over 30,"" and now they're over 30 and say, ""Trust us, and what we teach!"" Thank you, FOXNews.com - University of Colorado Board Votes to Fire Embattled Professor Ward Churchill - Local News | News Articles | National News | US News Ward Churchill. One of the most revered mantras of liberal fundamentalism is equality. The net effect of this experiment, in many instances, was to elevate women via the degradation of men, promote racial equality by instituting race-based preferences and reverse discrimination, engender class warfare against people of means via their socialistic redistribution of wealth schemes (a concept centered in greed for other peoples money, rather than relying on ones own personal initiative and work ethic), and elevate wickedness (sodomy, fornication, pornography, and other ungodly issues) to the plateau of respectability at the expense of traditional Godly values. Along with the failed liberal concept of equality was the mantra of liberal tolerance. However, liberal tolerance is not what it appears to be. It is a contradictory, partisan philosophical perspective with its own rigid set of dogmas. It assumes, for instance, a relativistic view of moral and religious knowledge. This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality, abortion rights, and religious truth claims, leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs. But this posture is often dogmatic, intolerant, and coercive, for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues, and if one does not embrace it, one may likely face public ridicule, demagogic tactics, and perhaps even legal reprisals. Liberal tolerance is therefore neither liberal nor tolerant. Rather than truly embrace freedom, liberal fundamentalists seek to control virtually every aspect of the lives of the masses that are unfortunate enough to be under their fundamentalist rulership. They seek to outlaw SUVs, impose smoking bans while advocating marijuana use, prohibit freedom of religious expression in government and public schools, advocate compulsory training in politically correct opinions and attitudes, seek to enforce Bible bans in schools and the workplace, embrace a de-facto litmus test against pro-life judicial nominees, seek to criminalize pro-life demonstrations through the RICO racketeering statute, try to squelch legitimate religious speech via hate-speech laws (note Canada), and generally engage in a wide range of behaviors designed to subvert the U.S. Constitution and traditional American values. It is certainly arguable, then, that progressive liberal fundamentalism substantially undermines the basic effectiveness of the government and other societal elements of democracy. Despite the idealistic goals of liberalism, attempts to build a utopian liberal society in America have only led to heightened outbreaks of AIDS, VD, porno-related crime, social divisions, divorce, abortion, drug addictions, deficit spending, the welfare state, a crushing tax burden, the breakdown of the family unit, moral depravity, and numerous other such scourges which have resulted in enormous societal suffering and discontent. As a result, liberal fundamentalism is strongly associated with left-wing fanaticism, reverse-racism, anti-intellectualism, elitism, nihilism, godlessness, and societal violence.
