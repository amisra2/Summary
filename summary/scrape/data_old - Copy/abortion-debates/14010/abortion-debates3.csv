"03-14-2010","14010",3,"None","None","None","omega word","394596","well obviously a baby is a parasite until born. it lives of its mother, siphoning off a little food and nutrition. it also makes most mother act differently, usually in a bad way, so there is no way the mother benefits. therefore it is a parasite. also if my mother had chosen not to have me that would have been her right as an American and i respect that. _____________________________________________ if god wishes to rule my life and mind, let him appear and let him talk.","pro-choice-roots","08:42 PM","abortion-debates","33"

Parasites Read this link and educate yourself. Nowhere in it will you find any reference to a baby being a parasite, or a pregnant woman being infected by a fetal parasite. You can think anything you like but that doesn't mean you're right. And as for Galileo, are you serious? I'm in my fifties kiddo, I never met Galileo. I was born in 1953, not 1553. Get your centuries right and then get your history right cuz I'm not catholic either so I did nothing to him. Galileo Galilei - Biography","pro-choice-roots","09:40 PM","abortion-debates","37"

However, they, and anyone else who thinks like them, are the real baby killers when they participate in, or defend, abortion.","Shooterandproud","394640","The hippies incorrectly called Veitnam Vets ""baby killers"", and now you're doing the exact same thing to everyone who supports freedom of choice.
