"03-21-2010","14010",5,"jitobear","395435","By our standards, sure, but the Romans weren't so tender-hearted. Jesus was preaching about a new kingdom at hand (that wan't Roman) and riling up an occupied people during a time they traditionally celebrate their freedom from oppression (Passover). Historical documents paint Pilate as quite the bastage and here he was in Jerusalem, during Passover, nowhere near home and he had a trouble maker in his midst. Not that the Jewish powers didn't have their hand in it, they surely did, but Jesus certainly was doing enough to tick off Rome and I doubt Pilate blinked an eye about crucifying him.","Archangel","395465","You would be wrong in your assumption then because Pilate saw no guilt in Jesus and wanted to spare Him against the will of those who sought His crucifixion. Here is the account from the bible to remind you of the specific events. Mat 27:11 Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned Him, saying, ""Are You the King of the Jews?"" And Jesus said to him, ""It is as you say."" Mat 27:12 And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He did not answer. Mat 27:13 Then Pilate said to Him, ""Do You not hear how many things they testify against You?"" Mat 27:14 And He did not answer him with regard to even a single charge, [fn] so the governor was quite amazed. Mat 27:15 Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the people [fn] any one prisoner whom they wanted. Mat 27:16 At that time they were holding a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas. Mat 27:17 So when the people gathered together, Pilate said to them, ""Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"" Mat 27:18 For he knew that because of envy they had handed Him over. Mat 27:19 While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, ""Have nothing to do with that righteous Man; for last [fn] night I suffered greatly in a dream because of Him."" Mat 27:20 But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to put Jesus to death. Mat 27:21 But the governor said [fn] to them, ""Which of the two do you want me to release for you?"" And they said, ""Barabbas."" Mat 27:22 Pilate said to them, ""Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?"" They all said, ""Crucify [fn] Him!"" Mat 27:23 And he said, ""Why, what evil has He done?"" But they kept shouting all the more, saying, ""Crucify [fn] Him!"" Mat 27:24 When Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, ""I am innocent of this Man's blood; see to that yourselves."" Mat 27:25 And all the people said, ""His blood shall be on us and on our children!"" As you can see, it wasn't Pilate's will that Jesus be crucified but was the will of the Chief Priests who stoked up the people against Jesus and even were willing to take the consequences of choosing a convicted murderer like Barabbas to be ""freed"" in place of the promised Messiah, upon their own heads and the heads of their children. It is widely believed that this single choice was the cause of the spiritual blindness and suffering which the Jewish people have experienced over the last 2 millennia and will continue to suffer until their spiritual eyes are opened during the Tribulation Period when they finally recognize Jesus as the promised Messiah who died for the sins of Man. Gods covenant with the Jewish people which He made with Abraham is intact, but God chastens (punishes) those whom He loves and this is what has been occurring over the last 2,000 years to Israel/the Jewish People. Hebrews 12:56 (NKJV) 5 And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to sons: My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord, Nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him; 6 For whom the Lord loves He chastens, And scourges every son whom He receives.","pro-choice-roots","07:27 AM","abortion-debates","64"

I believe the man was a bastard and that by Roman law Jesus was conducting activities that could have easily gotten him crucified. Not that I don't believe that Jewish leaders at the time weren't supportive - I am sure they were and urged their Roman pals along. Christ was a threat to their power base. I am sure they did all they could to demonize him and get him out of the picture. If Pilate gave the crowd a choice, I am sure it was for his own amusement and/or to appease the Jewish leaders who wanted Jesus out of the picture.

But Jesus didn't act like any accused man he had ever known before. And although promoting a god other than Caesar was a crime at the time, it was understood that Israel had their own God and Rome allowed that belief in order to avoid a complete uprising by the Jews. The fact is that Pilate did wash his hands of any culpability for the death of Jesus and found no reason to crucify Him since He had broken no Roman Law at all. Further proof of this is that he previously sent Caiphus and Jesus to Herod, Pilates superior, and Governor over the whole Province, only for Herod to send them back to Pilate. So beside neither leader seeing nothing that Jesus did that justified crucifying Him, as Easy said, his wife's dream the previous night must have surely had an impact on Pilate. And one more thing Jito, do you know anything about who Barabbas was? He was a Jewish political zealot who was convicted or murdering one or more Roman Centurion's in his quest to free Israel from Roman rule. He was awaiting execution for his crime against Rome so I'm sure it galled Pilate to release someone he knew was a true threat to Rome instead of this innocent man who was being led to the slaughter without ever opening his mouth in His own defense. But this custom of freeing a guilty man on Passover was longstanding and had to be honored, so the rebellious Jews got their wish to their longstanding regret.","pro-choice-roots","04:46 PM","abortion-debates","73"
