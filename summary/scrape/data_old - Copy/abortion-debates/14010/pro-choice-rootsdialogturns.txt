Turn No: 1:  Easyrider: 
I'd like to introduce you to the bigger picture: Psalm 139:13 - 'For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb.' Jeremiah 1:5 - 'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations." Of course, the question is, what divine insight does the pro-abortion crowd think they have to where they can destroy in a mother's womb that which God is somehow instrumental in creating?
Turn No: 2: chester:
If so you believe, then so you must act, within your own family. What you need to remember is that not all Americans share your answer to what is at best a metaphysical question. Please let us know why you think your particular answer should be law in the universe? In the interim, keep your poison away from the women in my family who are of child bearing age. They are perfectly capable of making their own choices without your "advice."

We don't butcher the unborn. Nor do most of Americans share yours. See my Biblical references above. Go climb on a parking meter, dweeb. And tell your stiff-necked, spiritually constipated family members to quit imitating the devil and stop killing the innocent unborn.

OOOHH!! Such ANGER!!! What is it about you righties that impels you to resort to ad hominem attacks on those whose opinion differs from yours? Must be that your quiver quivers for the lack of the arrows of substance.
Turn No:5
Easyrider:
People like you who defend the infanticide of the innocent unborn. I think you people need to clean the abortionist's sinks when you're done, and bury the dead, so you can see the end product of your demented and ungodly immoral relativism.
Turn No:6
chester:
"Demented and ungodly", eh? Your rant is totally off base and irrelevant to those of us who do not equate abortion with infanticide. Spare us your phony rage.
Turn No:7
Easyrider:
And your belief is contrary to God's will, as I previously documented. One day you will be held to account for it. There's nothing phony about it. Just wish I could legally deport you.
Turn No:8
chester:
1. How DARE you to speak as one who claims to know the will of God. Besides which, we are not living in a theocracy. If you want one of those, Iran might just be to your liking. 2. This Springsteen-American is staying right where he is, thank you very much. This Springsteen-American has just as much right to fly the flag of the USA outside his house as you do - more in fact. 3. This Springsteen-American has enough confidence in the women of his family to make choices that are in their best interest without any help from the likes of you. Keep your poison away from them!
Turn No:9
Easyrider:
Murder is murder, whether it's the old or the unborn. It's not rocket science. And I dare greatly, thank you! Strawman. You don't have to live in a theocracy to know murding the innocent unborn is wrong. Actually, Iran might be more to your liking since they don't value life very much either. Fly your flag, but don't think for a moment that the God who brought this nation forth approves of the mass infanticide of the innocent unborn. Godly women don't kill their unborn. They nurture them. As for poision, you're the ones who advocate death and infanticide, not me.

I'm sure Adolph Hitler had the same mindset. Where's the baby's choice? Why don't you self-absorbed egomaniacs ever think about the innocent baby that's being butchered? You don't kill an innocent baby for the sins or convenience of the parent(s). I think every time some woman aborts her baby she needs to not only view the remains of the dismembered baby she just had murdered, but then she needs to clean up the bloody abortionist's sink.

Turn No: 2: Shooterandproud:
Adolf Hitler was making choices about the bodies of others, kind of like what you are doing. Let this be a testament to your ignorance, that you would read the above post by Jito and still have the nerve to say something as stupid as this. Did you not hear a thing she said? It just doesn't matter to you does it... the suffering of others. As long as you're going to heaven who cares about anyone else? What a good Christian you are. Sleep well.

Go climb on a parking meter, meat face. STOP KILLING THE INNOCENT BABIES!!! What is it about the innocent unborn that you think they should have a bullseye on their heads? Butchers.

Its not a baby, its an inanimate life form. The woman has feelings, the fetus does not! What makes you think a mentally inanimate thing with no thoughts, feelings, or emotions deserves the right to cause physical and psychological agony toward another human being? By your logic, I should have the right to take a sledgehammer to your privates. The rights of real humans come before the rights of humans that don't exist yet!
Turn No:5
Easyrider:
Nuts. Funny how when a woman wants to give birth she always announces that SHE'S GOING TO HAVE A BABY!
Turn No:6
Shooterandproud:
Exactly, shes going to have a baby , not "I already have a baby".
Turn No:7
Easyrider:
That's stupid. That same day she looks over at her husband and says, "Honey, come quick and feel THE BABY kicking."
Turn No:8

And I sometimes call the graphite on a pencil "lead", even though its not. A slang term for a fetus is hardly scientific evidence.
