Just as we would never force a woman TO abort, we also support her right not to be forced into NOT aborting. It's a woman's choice, despite your ever more frantic ad hominem comments.","pro-choice-roots","07:28 PM","abortion-debates","17"

That same day she looks over at her husband and says, ""Honey, come quick and feel THE BABY kicking.""","pro-choice-roots","08:06 AM","abortion-debates","19"

"03-14-2010","14010",2,"iangb","394549","You may wish to look up 'quickening', when it happens during pregnancy, the development of the foetus at that time and how legal it is to abort after that point. Just a thought.","Easyrider","394550","I'd like to introduce you to the bigger picture: Psalm 139:13 - 'For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb.' Jeremiah 1:5 - 'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations."" Of course, the question is, what divine insight does the pro-abortion crowd think they have to where they can destroy in a mother's womb that which God is somehow instrumental in creating?","pro-choice-roots","04:27 PM","abortion-debates","22"
"03-14-2010","14010",2,"None","None","None","omega word","394554","[QUOTE=iangb;394553]...so the Bible says people are made in the womb. That doesn't mean that they are people from conception onwards, it means that they become people at some point during pregnancy - for example, at quickening. i agree with this. from a scientific view, baby's are simply unthinking parasites living and growing of the mother. however is there a difference between murder and the prevention of life? __________________________________________________ if god wishes to rule my life and mind let him appear and let him speak.","pro-choice-roots","05:04 PM","abortion-debates","24"
"03-14-2010","14010",2,"None","None","None","omega word","394565","i agree with that to a certain point. if you break a rock its not murder because its A. never alive and B. a rock. but if you prevent a baby's birth then in some terms it is murder. if you go back in time and kill your best friend's mother then you have killed your best friend to. if it would have lived but was stopped then it is a killing. don't think i am against abortion but it is killing, however since murder is defined as ending a life unlawfully and an unborn baby is not yet under the laws protection since up until a certain point it is not alive or if it is it is no more than a parasite and not actually human.","pro-choice-roots","05:55 PM","abortion-debates","26"

However, they, and anyone else who thinks like them, are the real baby killers when they participate in, or defend, abortion.","pro-choice-roots","05:58 PM","abortion-debates","27"
"03-14-2010","14010",2,"None","None","None","omega word","394569","being in a war is different. you are both under orders and serving your country. how does that make you responsible? i don't approve of war in general and some wars like Vietnam and the current one are rather pointless, but when someone like Hitler comes to power then i would be proud to serve personally. however i do stand behind abortion.","pro-choice-roots","06:02 PM","abortion-debates","28"
