Liberal Fundamentalism Someone once said to beware of zealots. Yet Jesus Christ was a zealot for the ways of God, and Mother Theresa was certainly a zealot for helping the sick and needy. Being a zealot, then, is not automatically a prescription for hated. Likewise, religious fundamentalism. One can certainly believe in the fundamental teachings of Jesus Christ and Biblical values, practice them, and not be a threat to society or ones neighbors. On the other hand, theres a new and particularly pernicious brand of fundamentalism making the rounds in America today liberal fundamentalism. Liberal Fundamentalism is a failed and destructive philosophical enterprise, replete with a host of anti-Biblical, pseudo-religious doctrines that seeks to elevate the ways and wisdom of man above the wisdom and desires of God. Its principle aim is the sacking of traditional Judaic and Christian values and beliefs, which are revisited through suspect liberal scholarship or politically-correct dogma in an effort to replace them with the tenets of carnal moral hedonism and the failed social doctrines of todays liberal elitists. The genesis of todays liberal fundamentalists was the anti-traditionalist hedonists of the 1960's and 70's. They advocated fornication and free-love, illegal substance abuse, moral relativism, contempt for authority, and they enjoyed a prosperous America founded on the very hard work and enterprise they sought to distance themselves from. The freedoms they enjoyed were purchased by the blood, sweat and personal sacrifices of the very forefathers they held in contempt. Personal responsibility, self-restraint and self-sacrifice are often foreign concepts to them. Right and wrong, and good and evil were arbitrarily revisited, for such concepts had no objective meaning to them. They had no objective rationality for their hedonistic philosophy other than if it feels good, lets do it. The only righteous cause that qualified for support in their progressive mindset was the undermining and revising of traditional American and Judeo-Christian values. They said not to trust anyone ""over 30,"" and now they're over 30 and say, ""Trust us, and what we teach!"" Thank you, FOXNews.com - University of Colorado Board Votes to Fire Embattled Professor Ward Churchill - Local News | News Articles | National News | US News Ward Churchill. One of the most revered mantras of liberal fundamentalism is equality. The net effect of this experiment, in many instances, was to elevate women via the degradation of men, promote racial equality by instituting race-based preferences and reverse discrimination, engender class warfare against people of means via their socialistic redistribution of wealth schemes (a concept centered in greed for other peoples money, rather than relying on ones own personal initiative and work ethic), and elevate wickedness (sodomy, fornication, pornography, and other ungodly issues) to the plateau of respectability at the expense of traditional Godly values. Along with the failed liberal concept of equality was the mantra of liberal tolerance. However, liberal tolerance is not what it appears to be. It is a contradictory, partisan philosophical perspective with its own rigid set of dogmas. It assumes, for instance, a relativistic view of moral and religious knowledge. This assumption has shaped the way many people think about issues such as homosexuality, abortion rights, and religious truth claims, leading them to believe that a liberally tolerant posture concerning these issues is the correct one and that it ought to be reflected in our laws and customs. But this posture is often dogmatic, intolerant, and coercive, for it asserts that there is only one correct view on these issues, and if one does not embrace it, one may likely face public ridicule, demagogic tactics, and perhaps even legal reprisals. Liberal tolerance is therefore neither liberal nor tolerant. Rather than truly embrace freedom, liberal fundamentalists seek to control virtually every aspect of the lives of the masses that are unfortunate enough to be under their fundamentalist rulership. They seek to outlaw SUVs, impose smoking bans while advocating marijuana use, prohibit freedom of religious expression in government and public schools, advocate compulsory training in politically correct opinions and attitudes, seek to enforce Bible bans in schools and the workplace, embrace a de-facto litmus test against pro-life judicial nominees, seek to criminalize pro-life demonstrations through the RICO racketeering statute, try to squelch legitimate religious speech via hate-speech laws (note Canada), and generally engage in a wide range of behaviors designed to subvert the U.S. Constitution and traditional American values. It is certainly arguable, then, that progressive liberal fundamentalism substantially undermines the basic effectiveness of the government and other societal elements of democracy. Despite the idealistic goals of liberalism, attempts to build a utopian liberal society in America have only led to heightened outbreaks of AIDS, VD, porno-related crime, social divisions, divorce, abortion, drug addictions, deficit spending, the welfare state, a crushing tax burden, the breakdown of the family unit, moral depravity, and numerous other such scourges which have resulted in enormous societal suffering and discontent. As a result, liberal fundamentalism is strongly associated with left-wing fanaticism, reverse-racism, anti-intellectualism, elitism, nihilism, godlessness, and societal violence.

"03-31-2010","14010",10,"Archangel","396375","Actually, it's called a common sense analogy, and anyone with a modicum of common sense can see that. In other words, just because abortion is legal today in America, that doesn't mean it isn't genocide against a segment of our population which has no voice of its own and is beingmurdered for the sake of another segments convenience.","Shooterandproud","396617","""In an analogy, two objects (or events), A and B are shown to be similar. Then it is argued that since A has property P, so also B must have property P. An analogy fails when the two objects, A and B, are different in a way which affects whether they both have property P. "" Since the holocaust has the property of being Murder, so also abortion must have the property of murder. An analogy fails when the two objects, the holocaust and abortion, are different in a way which affects whether they both have the property of murder (like fetuses not being Jewish people IE not brain dead).","pro-choice-roots","06:36 PM","abortion-debates","143"
"03-31-2010","14010",10,"Easyrider","396297","Originally Posted by Easyrider: Bust the resurrection. If you think you can. If you can't that's your key to understanding the truth you already got. You have no idea how pertinent that is. The resurrection is the crux of Christianity. Jesus said he would raise himself from the dead (""Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it again."" He was speaking of the temple of his body). If Christ can do that, and if he is risen, then what he says, and the premise of Christianity, are solid. That would include Jesus' statements on Genesis, what the prophets prophesied, etc. But it looks like you can't bust the resurrection, so you're weak. If it were such a sham you, WITH YOUR BRILLIANT MIND, should be able to bust it in a heartbeat. But you can't, can you? Also, did you answer Archangel's question about where in the Bible it says the world is 6,000 years old? That's another hairbrained argument you people buy into because you haven't done your due-diligence and studied the issue.","Shooterandproud","396618","You epically fail to take into account the fact that the bible was passed down through many generations of oral tradition before it was written down. Don't you think the story got a bit distorted and exaggerated during those hundreds of years? Do you actually think there were talking snakes, virgin births, and resurrections from the dead? Or has it crossed your mind that these ""truths"" may have been inadvertently distorted through the centuries, like all stories passed through oral tradition are? Once you can prove to me that the content of the Bible stayed exactly true, even after being told for hundreds of years ( very unlikely), then we can talk.","pro-choice-roots","06:41 PM","abortion-debates","144"

You start it out by saying something softly to one person, and they tell it to the next, and the next, until 15 or 20 people later you get a really distorted or totally different version of what was originally said, right? WHAT YOU PEOPLE NEVER TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IN THIS WARM AND FUZZY LIBERAL ARGUMENT IS THAT THERE WAS ALWAYS A PERSON THERE WHO KNEW WHAT THE TRUTH (TRUE SAYING) WAS, AND HE LET EVERYONE KNOW WHAT IT WAS. Likewise, the caretakers of the Word of God made sure the cretins didn't screw up the New Testament. Generation after generation they took care of business, SO THAT WHAT WE HAVE TODAY AGREES STRONGLY WITH THE EARLIEST KNOWN EXTANT MANUSCRIPTS . You people ALWAYS conveniently forget to mention that, don't you? Do you do that on purpose or are you just scatterbrained not to mention it? Sorry, Jack, that dog of yours won't hunt, As for miracles, you have your own mind-blowing miracles you have to believe in when you deny the existence of God. Among those are a whole universe magically appearing out of nothing, and the mathematically improbable concept of abiogenesis. On sciences attempts to explain / justify abiogenesis: There isnt any doubt that science, for the moment at least, is at a dead end. The optimism of the 1950s is gone. The mood at the 1999 international conference on origin of life was described as grim full of frustration, pessimism, and desperation. Nobody pretends that any alternative provides a reasonable path of how life went unguided from simple chemicals to proteins to basic life forms. Quote by Walter L. Bradley, Ph.d. Designed or Designoid Klaus Dose, the biochemist whos considered one of the foremost experts in this area, summed up the situation pretty well: More than thirty years of experimentation on the origin of life in the fields of chemical and molecular evolution have led to a better perception of the immensity of the problem of the origin of life on earth rather than to its solution. At present all discussions on principle theories and experiments in the field have either ended in stalemate or in a confession of ignorance. OH YE OF GREAT FAITH!!! P.S. stop killing the innocent unborn.","pro-choice-roots","09:05 PM","abortion-debates","146"
