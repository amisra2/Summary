"04-17-2009","12568",1,"None","None","None","Lakrite","349929","Think about this. If a man wants to have sex with a woman, he will more likely do so if he knows the woman can just get an abortion. If abortion remains legal, more men will continue to use women as simply sex objects. The man will have no responsibility, as even if ""safer sex"" practices do not work, abortion is always the back-up escape plan. If abortion were illegal, men would not be as likely to use women as objects for sexual pleasure. Why? If the woman gets pregnant, the man will have to help pay for the child. Unless he really loves the woman and wants to be with her, he will have absolutely no desire to pay for a child for any portion of his life. It takes both a man and a woman to have a child. Over 90% of the time both are willing to have sex, and nothing is forced upon the woman. Only 1% of pregnancies are a result of rape. The woman can just say NO. The man can resist his temptations like most members of society can. Abortion makes women sex objects. Without the possibility of a child, men can continue to abuse women and not worry about a new life forming because of it.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","06:45 PM","abortion-debates","1"

I'm sure you thought it out properly before you posted. So what? If legal abortion leads to more sex object treatment, therefore it should be banned? Because men treating women as ""sex objects"" is the worst thing in the world, worse than all the negative outcomes that result from outlawing abortion? Somehow I don't think so.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","07:56 PM","abortion-debates","2"

If they knew abortion was not an option, they would probably think twice before having sex with any woman they wanted.","chester","350088","So then, you think that the threat of criminalizing abortion will decrease sexual activity. In earlied posts you condemned wome's ""lust"". We gather that you think sexuality is a BAD thing. Why?

We gather that you think sexuality is a BAD thing. Why?","Lakrite","350112","Not necessarily. It will decrease the amount of pregnancies in my opinion. More people will use condoms if they know that abortion is no longer an option. There might be a slight decrease in sexual activity in people not wanting to risk the failure of condoms. Not just women's lust, but the lust of men as well. There is absolutely nothing wrong with having sex. Sexuality is a good thing. I am not sure where you got the idea I thought otherwise. No one yet has argued the main point of this topic. I am waiting for somebody to prove me wrong. Abortion degrades a woman's sexuality. A man can go to a woman and say, ""have sex with me."" The woman would reply ""I dont want to have a child"" The man would respond ""just get an abortion."" Does the man in that case care about the woman, or just care about sex? He certainly does not care about the purpose of sex to create children.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","03:58 PM","abortion-debates","6"

What's wrong with that? Why shouldn't two peole who are attactive to each other have sex? Who are you to say that, if it results in a pregnancy, that you know better than the pregnant woman how to determine the future of that pregnancy? What is it that makes you think that your word should be law in the universe?","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","06:23 PM","abortion-debates","7"

Yes, you should, because you clearly haven't. Please show evidence for this claim. This is not an issue of ""think about it""; this is a positive claim that needs to be supported with recorded data. Nonsense. No legislation can change personal views, especially views that are related only tangentially to the legislation. Or, show that I'm wrong by providing evidence. You know, that pesky connection to reality that you seem to be missing? This is like saying that skydiving with a parachute is irresponsible because the skydiver has a backup 'chute . Wrong. See, this is where it helps to check some numbers. (You know, that reality thing again.) In most places where abortion is illegal, abortion rates are comparable to places where abortion is legal. Laws don't tend to have as large an effect as you seem to wish. People who want an abortion just go to where they can get one legally, or they get one illegally, meaning in a non-regulated, dangerous, and often unhealthy way. Ask me for data. Go ahead. Follow the request by posting data that support your point.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","02:28 AM","abortion-debates","11"
