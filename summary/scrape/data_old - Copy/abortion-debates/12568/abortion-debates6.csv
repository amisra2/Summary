I think maybe you should slow down and re-read what you just responded to and maybe re-think your response to it. Also, you might want to consider that you can't invite someone into your house (intentionally or un-intentionally) then change your mind and kill them for tresspassing.","jitobear","351880","You asked why he difference of rights between baby of the same age - the only difference beiing whether they are born. I told you the determining factor. Location, location, location. But I sure as hell can throw you out. Also - unless you accept abortion in the case of molestation or rape this is an empty argument from you.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","08:03 PM","abortion-debates","77"

Chester mistakingly attributed more rights to a premature born baby than he does one that is 6 weeks old.

It's not a matter of whether or not I accept the justifications in cases of rape or molestation,... They are Constitutionally justified regardless of how I (or anyone else) ""feels"" about it.

"04-30-2009","12568",6,"jitobear","351875","Because its in the womb, and that womb does not belong to the fetus, government or you.","Archangel","351886","If this statement is true Jito, then the fetus doesn't belong to the mother either and you are supporting the concept of its independent status. Nobody should have the right to expel it from its only source of life giving sustenance. And if you will argue that the woman should against the will of the father, then so should the father against the will of the woman. You can't have it both ways, or should I say you shouldn't be allowed to. But that is precisely how the cards are stacked in favor of women having the sole and exclusive right in our society to kill, as in murder the most innocent segment of our population and get away with it because the victim has no voice with which to defend itself. How can you claim to be a person of compassion and defend this ritualized culture of murder?","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","08:12 PM","abortion-debates","80"

Your analogy really works in my favor - try another. Or not. I am off.","Chuz Life","351892","The analogy doesn't work in your favor at all. You can claim it does,.. but it doesn't. To use your additional aspects,... if you invited a homeless person into your home and turned them out into the cold and he/she subsequently froze to death,... you could very well be held liable for their death. To suggest that then means that you have to provide them food and shelter for several months until it's warm enough outside is just another (of many) appeals to ridicule. It's a fallacious ""appeal to ridicule"" analogy because you completely ignored all the other remedies to the situation (calling the police, homeless shelter, taxi, put them on a Bus, etc.) All of which are not options for evicting an un-wanted pre-birth child. I understand and KNOW the desperation first hand (of having an unplanned pregnancy) believe me I do. I was a single parent for nearly 10 years because of a failed marriage that resulted from an un-planned pregnancy. You don't have to explain to me about being young, unready or desperate. I've been there.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","08:34 PM","abortion-debates","83"
"05-01-2009","12568",6,"Lakrite","351912","That is completely illogical. What you just stated was that: The life of a baby in the womb for 6 months is not worth the same as the life of a baby born premature after 6 months of pregnancy. Literally the only difference between the two is that one baby is in the womb and the other isn't. What logic do you use to conclude that the baby is worth less inside of the womb? Am I worth less depending on where I am? If you want to make it about ownership you have to remain consistent. Womb belongs to mother, so mother can kill what is in the womb. You agree with that statement? Then you must also agree that House belongs to mother, so mother can kill what is in the house. If ownership of the womb is the variable that makes the baby worthless inside of the womb, then you have to apply to other circumstances of ownership or it wont logically make sense. There is a word for using different logic in similar situations in order to justify something...the word is denial. The ownership of something does not permit the killing of a life in it.","jitobear","352021","Actually I made no value judgements at all. Yep Please. Its not like I picked up my womb at the Wal-Mart. Or took out a loan. My body is not property. Its part of my person. To deny a person complete autonomy in regards to their body is a limitation of freedom. Life without liberty is meaningless. The founding fathers knew that. I know it. I was a battered wife and I have been raped. I will break the neck of the next SOB who tries to take control of my body. I will also disregard any law. Decisions regarding my life and health will be mine and mine alone. Not up for discussion. Ever. I will not negotiate that. Period. Now that said - abortion is horrible and I am keenly interested in how that can be fixed. But you are not. You, like most people on both sides of this issue, are more interested in the argument than the issue. It really isn't rocket science to figure out that villifying and disempowering women are hardly effective ways to fix anything - - at all.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","02:18 PM","abortion-debates","86"

The only difference between a baby born premature after 6 months and an unborn baby at 6 months is the location of the baby. One is in the womb, the other is not. If a baby of the same age can be killed in a womb, but not outside of it, you are putting more value on the born baby. You actually are making a value judgement. You need to explain why a baby can be killed inside the womb if another baby totally equal in all respects cannot be killed outside of the womb. Ownership seems to be the only possible reasoning, which would make the fetus property, thus devaluing it. Please clarify your position if it is not inline with what I am stating. Don't be circuitous, simply state your position clearly. I can say the same exact thing about a fetus...and by the way, a fetus is NOT part of the woman's body. It has a separate brain, separate organs...nobody would say that a mother has two separate hearts while pregnant; the baby has one, she has the other. A baby growing inside of a mother often does not even have the same blood type. People cannot have more than one blood type. So explain to me how a fetus is part of the mother's body. Furthermore, the fetus is not even of the same DNA. It has DNA of the father and mother. It is not at all a part of the mother's body. The fetus is simply living inside of the mother. I didn't buy my house at wall-mart either. People do not have to buy what they own. Of course! But the problem lies in the fact that a fetus is a separate life, as demonstrated by its unique DNA and blood type. That is the attitude of a close-minded person. You have to be open to knowledge and ideas. I have been convinced against my own positions before because I allowed an open mind. Close-minded people often ignore key facts and points and deny logic rather than try to understand it. Perfect example of the denial of logic. You say abortion is horrible, and you also say that it kills. You don't know how to fix it, and claim that I am not trying to. The logical thing to do to lessen the number of abortions would be to outlaw it. You deny that as a solution by bringing up the ""woman's body"" argument when it has continually been disproved. Outlawing abortion will be effective, as evidence shows in the only developed countries with outlawed abortion. Not a very sensible post. The issue is abortion and the life of the child. Obviously, if people argue for or against abortion they care about the issue. Enough with that argument already! I suppose that all pro-life women want to disempower themselves? That argument has been disproved countless times. But just to reinforce its invalidity, let me sum up why it is ridiculous to say abortion disempowers women. 1. Disempowering anyone to perform the act of killing is not a bad thing. Abortion empowers women and allows them to kill the developing child within them. The right to kill the innocent is not a power anyone should have. 2. Abortion disempowers men. There are several cases in which men want the child. Why is the woman the sole decider in what happens to the child? Often the argument is ""woman's body"" but the child is NOT the woman's body. If somebody is in my house, that person does not become my house... Would you like to state why abortion disempowers women? What rights does it actually take away from them? Control over their body? I think not; a woman's body cannot have two blood types or two unique DNA's... The ISSUE is the right to life of a child, born or unborn. The Pro-Choice side makes the issue about the rights of the woman. Pro-Life advocates understand the ""woman's body"" and ""disempowerment"" talking points, but most Pro-Choicers wont even argue against the right to life, and ignore the issue of the Pro-Life side.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","07:41 PM","abortion-debates","90"
