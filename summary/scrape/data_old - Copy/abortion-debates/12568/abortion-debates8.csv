"05-04-2009","12568",8,"Lakrite","352554","So if there is no value judgement between babies...why is it that one of the exact same worth can be killed and the other not? You are essentially arguing that because the mother is in an unfortunate situation she has the right to kill her child to make that situation go away. The mother will not DIE during childbirth. You are not choosing between the life of the fetus and the life of the mother. In the case of a pregnancy where the mother would die, of course she can choose her own life because death to either the mother or her child would be certain. The effect of an abortion on the mother's growing child is far worse than mood swings and any emotional impacts. And think about this. A newborn baby ALSO puts emotional and physical stress on a woman. Crying all night long? Tiring the woman out? Changing diapers? That would surely be stressful. Hyper children running around the house would be physically and emotionally tiring for women. Why do the rights of the woman to kill the child not continue throughout the child's life? Pregnancy is not at all the only time in life where women experience physical or emotional stress. Whether it be the woman's child or her boss at work, just because she is stressed does not mean she can kill that boss or child. Thats fine. But the fetus is NOT your body. It just isn't. That is a fact. I have already gone into depth about the inaccuracy of stating that legality has no effect. Reread earlier posts. It is not accurate at all to compare developing countries with developed countries and then determine that because something doesn't seem to work in a developing country it wont work in a developed one. Ireland has one of the lowest abortion rates out of all the developing countries...and guess what? It has illegal abortion. It is also pretty much the only developed country with illegal abortion throughout. Of course. This should be done. But it does not justify at all the right to kill a fetus ever. Of course there are reasons. But the reasons do not matter. Whether the woman is afraid, has a bad family relationship, is worried her education will be hurt, her career, her parents, her own social life...all of that really isn't what matters most which is human life. The life being lost here is the life of the fetus.","jitobear","352584","The value judgment I make is between the mother and the fetus. I value the mother higher. You value the fetus more. I can admit it. Can you? And can we please move on from the 6 month old fetus? You would be damned hard-pressed to find a doctor who would perform an abortion on a fetus that far along unless it isn't viable. This is like arguing about whether Superman or the Hulk is stronger. Any child already born can be given to somone else to care for. You can't hand your pregnancy over to someone else to manage for awhile. Never said it was. Are you trying to claim that pregnancy has nothing to do with a woman's body? If so, you need a biology lesson. And I question your conclusion. The Guttmacher Institure is a well-respected organization that has been around a long time. They work with the WHO. People on both sides of this issue trust them. I also know me. The legality of abortion would not impact my decision to have one. I know my line in the sand. Wasn't using it as justification. And this is where I stop this debate with you. I will let you figure out why.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","09:52 PM","abortion-debates","106"

If I had to choose between the LIFE of the fetus and the mother, I would most likely choose the mother. But abortion is not choosing between the LIFE of the fetus and the mother. If this is like arguing about the strength of Superman or Hulk, why is it you valued the mother higher? Your analogy actually supports my point that the two are equal... Most parents will not hand over their newborn infants to someone else to take care of so they can have a break. The point is your argument that abortion should be allowed because pregnancy causes stress on a woman is invalid because there are plenty of other things in the world, like young children, that cause stress on a woman as well. Odd you would think I am trying to claim that, considering I have acknowledged the affects of pregnancy on a woman's body. My claim is that a fetus is NOT part of the woman's body. You apparently agree. Which would mean your position is in favor of killing a human being for the benefit of the woman. The evidence Guttmacher gave was for the most part correct. The problem was within the analysis. It claimed that because abortion rates were similar in developed countries and developing countries, the legality of abortion therefore made little or no difference. The problem is, developing countries have such different societies and governments that they really cannot accurately compare to developed countries. Furthermore, the study didn't even compare abortion rates in countries were abortion was legal and illegal. It just said that ""most"" developing countries have illegal abortion and ""most"" developed countries have legal abortion. The countries that do not fall into that ""most"" can affect the outcome of the results. Even with this said, it is only fair to compare developing countries with legal abortion to developing countries with illegal abortion, or do the same for developed countries. We need to try to isolate the ""legality"" variable as much as possible. The most accurate way to determine the effects of the legalization of abortion would be to compare two similar countries of similar economic status or simply compare the US with its past. Comparing both, the legalization of abortion has created a higher abortion rate. I already made this point and explained it in depth with electrolyte. He had no response to it other than ""thinking doesn't matter"". He has since fled the conversation. Odd...why is it that you keep saying a woman has the right to an abortion because she has control of her body? Abortion kills the fetus of a woman, which is not part of her body. Because you are at a loss of what to say. You ignored the majority of my post. I presume you either didn't read it or simply didn't want to try to accept it. This is the EXACT type of close-mindedness I am talking about that so many Pro-death advocates have. Say I was having emotional problems so I killed my son. Is that ok because of the reasons? Say I needed more money, so I killed my grandfather and received my inheritance. Does that reason justify anything? I am worried that my parents will discover a child that my girlfriend already gave birth to. Does that fear justify at all the killing of it? The reasons for having an abortion really DONT matter. They don't at all justify the fact that an innocent life is being taken away. You quit this argument because it is to my current understanding that you cannot find away to argue against this.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","10:55 PM","abortion-debates","107"
