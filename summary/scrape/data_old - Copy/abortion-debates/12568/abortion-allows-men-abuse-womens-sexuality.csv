If abortion remains legal, more men will continue to use women as simply sex objects. The man will have no responsibility, as even if ""safer sex"" practices do not work, abortion is always the back-up escape plan. If abortion were illegal, men would not be as likely to use women as objects for sexual pleasure. Why? If the woman gets pregnant, the man will have to help pay for the child. Unless he really loves the woman and wants to be with her, he will have absolutely no desire to pay for a child for any portion of his life. It takes both a man and a woman to have a child. Over 90% of the time both are willing to have sex, and nothing is forced upon the woman. Only 1% of pregnancies are a result of rape. The woman can just say NO. The man can resist his temptations like most members of society can. Abortion makes women sex objects. Without the possibility of a child, men can continue to abuse women and not worry about a new life forming because of it.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","06:45 PM","abortion-debates","1"

I'm sure you thought it out properly before you posted. So what? If legal abortion leads to more sex object treatment, therefore it should be banned? Because men treating women as ""sex objects"" is the worst thing in the world, worse than all the negative outcomes that result from outlawing abortion?

More people will use condoms if they know that abortion is no longer an option. There might be a slight decrease in sexual activity in people not wanting to risk the failure of condoms. Not just women's lust, but the lust of men as well. There is absolutely nothing wrong with having sex. Sexuality is a good thing. I am not sure where you got the idea I thought otherwise. No one yet has argued the main point of this topic. I am waiting for somebody to prove me wrong. Abortion degrades a woman's sexuality. A man can go to a woman and say, ""have sex with me."" The woman would reply ""I dont want to have a child"" The man would respond ""just get an abortion."" Does the man in that case care about the woman, or just care about sex?

Yes, you should, because you clearly haven't. Please show evidence for this claim. This is not an issue of ""think about it""; this is a positive claim that needs to be supported with recorded data. Nonsense. No legislation can change personal views, especially views that are related only tangentially to the legislation. Or, show that I'm wrong by providing evidence. You know, that pesky connection to reality that you seem to be missing? This is like saying that skydiving with a parachute is irresponsible because the skydiver has a backup 'chute . Wrong. See, this is where it helps to check some numbers. (You know, that reality thing again.) In most places where abortion is illegal, abortion rates are comparable to places where abortion is legal. Laws don't tend to have as large an effect as you seem to wish. People who want an abortion just go to where they can get one legally, or they get one illegally, meaning in a non-regulated, dangerous, and often unhealthy way. Ask me for data. Go ahead.

"04-20-2009","12568",2,"article","None","Oh, look another positive claim. If it actually had any relevance to the discussion, I'd ask you to provide numbers. I don't think you can, because I think you pulled this idea right out of your bum. I find myself wondering why it is that you associate abortion-prohibiting countries with rampant crime yet still want to make this country abortion-prohibiting. Outlawing abortion does very little -- if anything -- to actually reduce the number of abortions. Even if we take the Guttmacher numbers at face value, however, the claim that criminalization does not effect the abortion rate does not bear scrutiny. Abortion in Ireland, for example, is illegal in most cases, whereas across the pond in England and Wales it is basically legal (though with more restrictions than in the U.S.). According to Guttmacher, the abortion rate for Ireland in 1996 was 5.9 . For England and Wales, 15.6. That is, by Guttmachers own numbers, the abortion rate for England (where abortion is legal) is several times what it is in Ireland (where it is not). Presumably the lower Irish rate is not due to the countrys fanatical devotion to sex education and contraception. 3. If you want to reduce the number of complications from abortions, those abortions should be legalized procedures performed by standard medical protocol and subject to standard medical oversight.","Lakrite","350423","A known fact is that the fast majority of all countries that have abortion outlawed are in South America and Africa. Countries in these regions are developing countries, and developing countries tend to have increased poverty and crime rates. The few that do allow abortion still have high crime rates. South Africa has very high crime rates, a known fact. You cannot compare the statistics of a developing country with the United States. Outlawing anything does very little in developing countries. However, in more recent years, crime rates have began to decrease in developing countries, but the abortion statistics I was given in the article were from 2003, when developing countries did have higher crime rates. But even if all of what I said above is totally false, you still cannot compare the abortion rates of developing and developed countries. The economic systems are entirely different. One reason for abortion is poverty, and developing countries have more poverty and would be more willing to break that law and have an abortion. In order to more fairly compare abortion rates, we must look not at countries in Africa but countries in Europe. This article explains why it makes little sense to say that by making something that had been legal illegal, more people will do that something. Ironically, it disputes the actual source of evidence you cited in your argument. Even if that evidence is completely valid, your own source disproves the point you are trying to make. Time to compare countries in Europe with more similar economic structures. Let us compare not Africa and the United States, but Ireland (Illegal Abortion) with England and Wales(Legal abortion) Actually, upon reading the whole article, it is stating what I was stating at the start of the post. Read the whole article, it touches on the main points that: 1. Abortion rates are higher in developing countries whether or not it is illegal or legal. 2. Developed countries have lower abortion rates. 3. When comparing developed countries with illegal and legal abortion rates, countries with illegal abortion have less abortions than countries with legal abortion. This point is correct, but the problem is that women should not be getting abortions when abortion is illegal. That is their own fault for breaking the law. It reminds me of court cases were burglars sued homeowners for slipping on their sidewalk when trying to break into their house. If people do damage to themselves as a result of breaking a law, that is their own problem. I have more to say, but I do not have time right now to type anything else or even proofread this post for typos etc. So I will be back later tonight to finish up.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","08:34 PM","abortion-debates","17"

The data show that the legality of abortion has minimal effect on the number of abortions performed. Period. It's that simple. What don't you understand about this?

That having an abortion was tantamount to murder or manslaughter, etc. Much of that denial was due to the Courts ignorance on things like genetics, the science regarding aging and ""when a person's life begins"", etc. So, YES,.. the demand for elective abortion grew as a result of the ignorance and denials of the court. (Specifically the Supreme Court) There is a cause and affect relationship between the finding and conclusions of our courts and the tolerances of society as reflected in our laws. That being said,.. were the courts to overturn Roe v. Wade, recognize the scientific evidence regarding genetics, aging, etc... and establish the fact that an abortion kills a child and that it is tantamount to ""murder"" or manslaughter,... The laws and tolerances reflected in our society would be likewise reflected. This is different from prohibitions like banning booze, because there is no recreational value in having an abortion. And an abortion, unlike having a beer is not a ""victimless"" crime. To suggest that the demand for abortion would INCREASE as a result of banning it is therefor unsubstantiated. I was responding to Lakrite's post, not yours. If you do not believe that the demand for abortion will increase as a result of it being banned,... all you had to do is say so.

You're arguing that the rights of an embryo deny the woman the right to abort the pregnancy. What else would you call it? But I have, and I still challenge you. For example, see immediately below: Perhaps you're used to railroading people who don't have a good understanding of science. I want to discuss the science. I don't want a formal debate, where the objectives of learning and teaching unfortunately become secondary to convincing the judges who is correct. Specifically, I challenge your logic: First, we can define ""aging"" in a number of ways. For example, we can determine the ""age"" of a rock via a (and I'm taking some descriptive liberties here) chemical clock, but we don't call that rock alive. Alternatively, we can look at ""aging"" as a result of telomeric shortening, which will begin as soon as mitosis starts. Why does this necessitate the attribute of ""life""? Once again, what the hell do you mean by ""biological aspects of personhood""? You've shown no actual connection (and certainly not a scientific one) between ""aging"" and ""personhood."" Your argument amounts to, ""because A has B, I conclude C."" Ugh. And you say you have a background in logic. What poppycock. You're thinking of the impossibility of proving a universal negative. Proving negatives happens all the time. If you want me to show you, thus making you look like a complete imbecile, I'll be happy to. For this post, I'll instead simply point out that your assertion, ""you can't prove a negative,"" which you have presented as fact, is itself a negative . But that's really not even the issue. It's not my job to prove a negative. He who has the positive claim has the burden of proof. If I want to argue that an embryo does not qualify as alive, that burden of proof is upon me. If you want to argue that embryos have life, or personhood, or rights, then the burden of proof is upon you. See, this is the BS I'm sick of dealing with. I repeatedly challenge your ""scientifically"" based conclusions, but all you do is repeat the claim and say that it's a fact. You should be aware that such a statement is meaningless unless you can draw a necessary correlation between these facts and the idea that embryos are legally ""persons.""","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","09:28 PM","abortion-debates","44"

Wow, this bait-and-switch is even more blatant that I'm used to seeing. Pretend I'm arguing that ""life"" and ""life"" are different. Yeesh. I already provided two counterexamples that should serve as a jumping point for clarification. Rocks age. They're not alive.

"04-29-2009","12568",4,"Lakrite","None","Thesis: Gravity exists. Claims: [none] Warrants: [none] Evidence: Things fall. I seem to recall that you posted one -- count it, all of it, ONE country that supports your point. That's cherry picking. Hell, I tested your claim about North America versus Europe, and you still didn't have evidence. Do you have anything else? Please learn to read. I stated that the abortion rate in Africa (and elsewhere) strongly suggest that the legality of abortion has little to no effect on abortion rates. The analysis is already on the website. I linked to the pages. Is this a case of you being unable to read or just unwilling to read? But in science, a theory is evidence, evidence, evidence. My point is that, no, I don't. The data support my point regardless of the reason why I've stated that legality is not an impactful variable. Abortion rates may be higher or lower for a number of reasons. I state legality is one of them and gave my reasons why above. I gave evidence. You have stated legality is not one of those variables. I never said that it was the only variable in play. In fact, I explicitly mentioned, multiple times, that it's not the only variable. Another lie. I agree! But simple logic appears to be too complex for you. You don't understand parody as a method of logical refutation. I see no reason to continue showing particular patience with people who won't answer questions.","Lakrite","351638","Sure thing. Thesis: Gravity exists as that force. Claims: A force must be causing things to fall. Warrants: An object in motion stays in motion, and an object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by an outside force. Evidence: Things fall. Only one developed country actually has true illegal abortion throughout itself... You are trying to find out if the legality of abortion has an effect on the number of abortions. How would comparing Europe and the United States prove anything? You have to compare developing countries that have legal abortion with developing countries with illegal abortion. That would mean that your opinion is different from the article...it compares the US to Africa/other developing countries and makes that conclusion... Yet you then tell me that I need to read the article again after telling me your point is not even what the article says? Definition of theory: ""1. A belief or principle that guides action or assists comprehension or judgment: staked out the house on the theory that criminals usually return to the scene of the crime. 2. The branch of a science or art consisting of its explanatory statements"" Definition of evidence: ""A thing or things helpful in forming a conclusion or judgment:"" Let me explain this to you as simplistically as possible. There are multiple variables that cause increased and lowered abortion rates. We will look at two of them. 1. Contraception 2. Legality Say a country has legal abortion and contraception, and another has neither. Country A has both. Country B has neither. Country A and B both have similar abortion rates. Now which of the factors listed causes this similarity? You cannot simply say that legality does not because of the evidence shown. That would be the same as saying contraception has no effect. One can say that the number of abortions will increase without contraception because more people will become pregnant. Therefore, contraception has an effect. Outlawing abortion will cause the availability of abortion to decrease. Therefore, it too has an effect on the number of abortions. If country A has something that decreases the number of abortions (contraception) and something that increases the number of abortions (legal abortion) are present at the same time, and Country B has something that decreases the number of abortions (illegal abortion) and increases the number of abortions (illegal contraception) at the same time, the two countries should have relatively similar abortion rates. And they do. The why is important. If you, as a science teacher, cannot understand that, then you should not be teaching science. Thats exactly what I said you stated. You aren't reading everything I am saying. ""one of those""=variables that do effect abortion rates, as clear from my paragraph in context. If that is true, then you DO have to explain why it is that legality is not one of the many variables that effect abortion rates. The evidence you showed may be caused by a number of variables, so now tell me why legality is not one of them. You still haven't. You can't be that ambiguous. You must literally say that A=this and B=this. You have to define the variables first. So you are willing to admit that there is no logical reasoning behind your argument? Oh the irony! I spy a hypocrite! You then must be impatient with yourself, for you have yet to answer my question. Why would the legality of abortion have no effect on the number of abortions? All common sense says it does. Think about it. Yes, think. I hate to tell you that people actually need to think. Abortion is legal: 1). People have access to it almost anywhere. 2). It is safe; more people will take the risk. 3). There is no legal punishment. Abortion is illegal: 1). Access is limited to illegal ""undercover"" operations. 2). It is dangerous; less people will take the risk. 3). There is legal punishment if caught. You cannot honestly tell me that you think abortion rates would be the same. It defies logic completely. Tell me why your evidence applies to your thesis. Why would the legality of abortion have no effect on the number of abortions?

You agree with that statement? Then you must also agree that House belongs to mother, so mother can kill what is in the house.

The only difference between a baby born premature after 6 months and an unborn baby at 6 months is the location of the baby. One is in the womb, the other is not. If a baby of the same age can be killed in a womb, but not outside of it, you are putting more value on the born baby. You actually are making a value judgement. You need to explain why a baby can be killed inside the womb if another baby totally equal in all respects cannot be killed outside of the womb. Ownership seems to be the only possible reasoning, which would make the fetus property, thus devaluing it. Please clarify your position if it is not inline with what I am stating. Don't be circuitous, simply state your position clearly. I can say the same exact thing about a fetus...and by the way, a fetus is NOT part of the woman's body. It has a separate brain, separate organs...nobody would say that a mother has two separate hearts while pregnant; the baby has one, she has the other. A baby growing inside of a mother often does not even have the same blood type. People cannot have more than one blood type. So explain to me how a fetus is part of the mother's body. Furthermore, the fetus is not even of the same DNA. It has DNA of the father and mother. It is not at all a part of the mother's body. The fetus is simply living inside of the mother. I didn't buy my house at wall-mart either. People do not have to buy what they own. Of course! But the problem lies in the fact that a fetus is a separate life, as demonstrated by its unique DNA and blood type. That is the attitude of a close-minded person. You have to be open to knowledge and ideas. I have been convinced against my own positions before because I allowed an open mind. Close-minded people often ignore key facts and points and deny logic rather than try to understand it. Perfect example of the denial of logic. You say abortion is horrible, and you also say that it kills. You don't know how to fix it, and claim that I am not trying to. The logical thing to do to lessen the number of abortions would be to outlaw it. You deny that as a solution by bringing up the ""woman's body"" argument when it has continually been disproved. Outlawing abortion will be effective, as evidence shows in the only developed countries with outlawed abortion. Not a very sensible post. The issue is abortion and the life of the child. Obviously, if people argue for or against abortion they care about the issue. Enough with that argument already! I suppose that all pro-life women want to disempower themselves? That argument has been disproved countless times. But just to reinforce its invalidity, let me sum up why it is ridiculous to say abortion disempowers women. 1. Disempowering anyone to perform the act of killing is not a bad thing. Abortion empowers women and allows them to kill the developing child within them. The right to kill the innocent is not a power anyone should have. 2. Abortion disempowers men. There are several cases in which men want the child. Why is the woman the sole decider in what happens to the child? Often the argument is ""woman's body"" but the child is NOT the woman's body. If somebody is in my house, that person does not become my house... Would you like to state why abortion disempowers women? What rights does it actually take away from them? Control over their body? I think not; a woman's body cannot have two blood types or two unique DNA's... The ISSUE is the right to life of a child, born or unborn. The Pro-Choice side makes the issue about the rights of the woman. Pro-Life advocates understand the ""woman's body"" and ""disempowerment"" talking points, but most Pro-Choicers wont even argue against the right to life, and ignore the issue of the Pro-Life side.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","07:41 PM","abortion-debates","90"

Grown women are perfectly capable, intelligent beings. They don't need a some misogynist daddy figure telling them whats best for them. B) Nobody is out there encouraging women to have abortions.

"05-04-2009","12568",7,"Lakrite","352080","So then explain to me what on earth it is you are thinking. The only difference between a baby born premature after 6 months and an unborn baby at 6 months is the location of the baby. One is in the womb, the other is not. If a baby of the same age can be killed in a womb, but not outside of it, you are putting more value on the born baby. You actually are making a value judgement. You need to explain why a baby can be killed inside the womb if another baby totally equal in all respects cannot be killed outside of the womb. Ownership seems to be the only possible reasoning, which would make the fetus property, thus devaluing it. Please clarify your position if it is not inline with what I am stating. Don't be circuitous, simply state your position clearly. I can say the same exact thing about a fetus...and by the way, a fetus is NOT part of the woman's body. It has a separate brain, separate organs...nobody would say that a mother has two separate hearts while pregnant; the baby has one, she has the other. A baby growing inside of a mother often does not even have the same blood type. People cannot have more than one blood type. So explain to me how a fetus is part of the mother's body. Furthermore, the fetus is not even of the same DNA. It has DNA of the father and mother. It is not at all a part of the mother's body. The fetus is simply living inside of the mother. That is the attitude of a close-minded person. You have to be open to knowledge and ideas. I have been convinced against my own positions before because I allowed an open mind. Close-minded people often ignore key facts and points and deny logic rather than try to understand it. Perfect example of the denial of logic. You say abortion is horrible, and you also say that it kills. You don't know how to fix it, and claim that I am not trying to. The logical thing to do to lessen the number of abortions would be to outlaw it. You deny that as a solution by bringing up the ""woman's body"" argument when it has continually been disproved. Outlawing abortion will be effective, as evidence shows in the only developed countries with outlawed abortion. Not a very sensible post. The issue is abortion and the life of the child. Obviously, if people argue for or against abortion they care about the issue. Enough with that argument already! I suppose that all pro-life women want to disempower themselves? Abortion disempowers men. There are several cases in which men want the child. Why is the woman the sole decider in what happens to the child? Often the argument is ""woman's body"" but the child is NOT the woman's body. If somebody is in my house, that person does not become my house... Would you like to state why abortion disempowers women? What rights does it actually take away from them? Control over their body? I think not; a woman's body cannot have two blood types or two unique DNA's... The ISSUE is the right to life of a child, born or unborn. The Pro-Choice side makes the issue about the rights of the woman. Pro-Life advocates understand the ""woman's body"" and ""disempowerment"" talking points, but most Pro-Choicers wont even argue against the right to life, and ignore the issue of the Pro-Life side.","jitobear","352508","I don't know. Maybe it is a kind of value judgement - but not between the babies. Each person deserves autonomy, freedom and personal rights. Pregnancy is a unique situation where two individuals are involved. If those two individuals needs are in conflict and only the rights of one can be supported - I believe that the fetus loses. The mother's rights supercede the fetus' - every time. I don't disagree with any of this but quit trivializing pregnancy. It impacts the health of the mother, drawing nourishment from her, changing her moods. The physical and emotional impacts of pregnancy are huge. It is not a benign relationship. Having complete and total control of my body is non-negotiable. Actually, I have a LOT of ideas. They have to do with education, health care, mentorship, addressing needs, and birth control. Actually you need to research that better. Half the world's abortions are unsafe or illegal abortions. The lowest incidences of abortion in the world are in developed nations, where there is access to health care, there are resources for expecting mothers and abortion is safe and legal. This information comes from the Guttmacher Institute. They are women's health organization that works with the WHO. They are frequently used by both pro-life and pro-choice organization for their information. There are ways to prevent unplanned pregnancy. Education and empowerment of women and girls is critical. Even in developed nations girls get the message that a woman without a man is a failure. Who wants to be a failure? Where do you think that will lead? Girls who are poor are at particular risk. They need mentorship. They need opportunity. Also - there are reasons women seek abortion. Addressing those reasons would also be a good start. Trivializing the realities of their life as ""selfish"" and removing their ability to make their own choices will not help. I got pregnant during college due to a birth control issue (slipped between when I was changing method). I was living in New Mexico at the time. I was a) worried about finishing my degree, b) I was told I could not get health care (I did not have insurance). Now someone could have come along and called me selfish, beat me over the head with a bible and showed me pictures of aborted fetuses OR my professors could have worked with me to ensure I was able to complete school and a clever and a non-judgemental woman at the state could have figured out to get me access to medical care. I will give you ONE GUESS as to which solution made it possible for me to have my baby. Now I am old broad, who doesn't date (or screw), is safe and has her tubes tied. That said, if I were to get pregnant today and that pregnancy were a) a serious threat to my HEALTH (not just my life), b) a serious threat to my livlihood or c) the result of rape - it will be ended. Laws be damned - it will be ended. Most women have their line in the sand. Now you can work with them, or rail against them and tie the hands of doctors which threatens women's access to complete and effective health care. Then why continue with these ineffective methods? Criminalization will just make abortion unsafe and give lifers a reason to pat themselves on the back, nor will you win hearts and minds with villification and trivialization. They can be. Many women are misogynistic. My father's mother comes to mind. But it does not mean they can stay when you want them to go. And although this situation sucks it is greatly over-shadowed by the number of women seeking abortion with either the support of the father or who are all alone. Yep. Don't be daft. Forcing a woman through a pregnancy against her will is controlling HER body. I get that.

You are essentially arguing that because the mother is in an unfortunate situation she has the right to kill her child to make that situation go away. The mother will not DIE during childbirth. You are not choosing between the life of the fetus and the life of the mother. In the case of a pregnancy where the mother would die, of course she can choose her own life because death to either the mother or her child would be certain. The effect of an abortion on the mother's growing child is far worse than mood swings and any emotional impacts. And think about this. A newborn baby ALSO puts emotional and physical stress on a woman. Crying all night long? Tiring the woman out? Changing diapers? That would surely be stressful. Hyper children running around the house would be physically and emotionally tiring for women. Why do the rights of the woman to kill the child not continue throughout the child's life? Pregnancy is not at all the only time in life where women experience physical or emotional stress. Whether it be the woman's child or her boss at work, just because she is stressed does not mean she can kill that boss or child. Thats fine. But the fetus is NOT your body. It just isn't. That is a fact. I have already gone into depth about the inaccuracy of stating that legality has no effect. Reread earlier posts. It is not accurate at all to compare developing countries with developed countries and then determine that because something doesn't seem to work in a developing country it wont work in a developed one. Ireland has one of the lowest abortion rates out of all the developing countries...and guess what? It has illegal abortion. It is also pretty much the only developed country with illegal abortion throughout. Of course. This should be done. But it does not justify at all the right to kill a fetus ever. Of course there are reasons. But the reasons do not matter. Whether the woman is afraid, has a bad family relationship, is worried her education will be hurt, her career, her parents, her own social life...all of that really isn't what matters most which is human life. The life being lost here is the life of the fetus. You do realize that institutes that help women cope with pregnancy are quite often pro-life? Nobody is advocating that the best solution to helping a woman get through her pregnancy is condemning her. If you believe that is the Pro-Life message you are completely off the message (not a surprise, the media tries to demonize pro-lifers) Once again, refer to earlier in this discussion. Country's that outlaw abortion see decreases in abortion rates. Do you have logic for why outlawing abortion would have no effect? So pro-life women are pro-life because they don't want women to have rights...please. Try again. Pro-life women realize that abortion is killing. Forcing a woman through pregnancy. Read that line. Forcing. Nobody forced the woman to get pregnant. Nobody forced her to have sex. And for the sake of God get it in your head that a fetus is NOT PART OF HER BODY! Yes, pregnancy effects women in many ways but abortions do not attempt to relieve these attitudes, their purpose is to kill an individual child. The fetus is not her body. She has every right to control her own body. When having sex, she knew that pregnancy was a possible option. She chose what to do with her body in the act of sex. Now she is faced with the responsibility of a child due to that sex. That child is NOT part of her body. She has absolutely no right to kill it. I understand that you believe women should have control over their bodies. I understand the many reasons women have abortions such as career, poverty, fear, and even guilt or shame when faced with family. I agree that we must educate people more about pregnancy and encourage people to practice abstinence if they do not want a child. I understand that a pregnancy can be both physically and emotionally hard for a woman. I understand every point made in favor of abortion. But each point ignores the main reason pro-lifers believe abortion is wrong. It kills a growing human being that is inside of the woman because of the natural process that is occurring due to sex. That child has every right to live! You shock me when you say that a baby born six months into pregnancy can not be killed but a baby in the womb after six months can be. That is honestly reminiscent of the idea of slavery. Two people, the only difference being skin color. Now the only difference is where the child is. The same idea of ownership over property is used today, but property is substituted with body. When slavery was abolished the southern plantation owners suffered terrible economic problems as the economy was destroyed. POVERTY. They were emotionally hurt as the witnessed their entire life crumble before them and watch as slaves that they paid for left. I can imagine how devastating it must have been for their entire families to go through. EMOTIONAL. But did those negative effects justify slavery? NO. Does the economic status and emotional effects of pregnancy on a woman justify abortion? NO. At least draw the parallel and acknowledge why abortion is so morally evil.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","06:41 PM","abortion-debates","105"

If I had to choose between the LIFE of the fetus and the mother, I would most likely choose the mother. But abortion is not choosing between the LIFE of the fetus and the mother. If this is like arguing about the strength of Superman or Hulk, why is it you valued the mother higher? Your analogy actually supports my point that the two are equal... Most parents will not hand over their newborn infants to someone else to take care of so they can have a break. The point is your argument that abortion should be allowed because pregnancy causes stress on a woman is invalid because there are plenty of other things in the world, like young children, that cause stress on a woman as well. Odd you would think I am trying to claim that, considering I have acknowledged the affects of pregnancy on a woman's body. My claim is that a fetus is NOT part of the woman's body. You apparently agree. Which would mean your position is in favor of killing a human being for the benefit of the woman. The evidence Guttmacher gave was for the most part correct. The problem was within the analysis. It claimed that because abortion rates were similar in developed countries and developing countries, the legality of abortion therefore made little or no difference. The problem is, developing countries have such different societies and governments that they really cannot accurately compare to developed countries. Furthermore, the study didn't even compare abortion rates in countries were abortion was legal and illegal. It just said that ""most"" developing countries have illegal abortion and ""most"" developed countries have legal abortion. The countries that do not fall into that ""most"" can affect the outcome of the results. Even with this said, it is only fair to compare developing countries with legal abortion to developing countries with illegal abortion, or do the same for developed countries. We need to try to isolate the ""legality"" variable as much as possible. The most accurate way to determine the effects of the legalization of abortion would be to compare two similar countries of similar economic status or simply compare the US with its past. Comparing both, the legalization of abortion has created a higher abortion rate. I already made this point and explained it in depth with electrolyte. He had no response to it other than ""thinking doesn't matter"". He has since fled the conversation. Odd...why is it that you keep saying a woman has the right to an abortion because she has control of her body? Abortion kills the fetus of a woman, which is not part of her body. Because you are at a loss of what to say. You ignored the majority of my post. I presume you either didn't read it or simply didn't want to try to accept it. This is the EXACT type of close-mindedness I am talking about that so many Pro-death advocates have. Say I was having emotional problems so I killed my son. Is that ok because of the reasons? Say I needed more money, so I killed my grandfather and received my inheritance. Does that reason justify anything? I am worried that my parents will discover a child that my girlfriend already gave birth to. Does that fear justify at all the killing of it? The reasons for having an abortion really DONT matter. They don't at all justify the fact that an innocent life is being taken away.
