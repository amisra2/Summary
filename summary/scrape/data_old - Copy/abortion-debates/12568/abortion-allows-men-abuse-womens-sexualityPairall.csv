You've made your declaration sans evidence and reason and pretend that it's beyond reproach. What idiocy. There it is again, more idiocy. Nobody needs to recognize conception as the biological beginnings of a human life until somebody can actually provide an argument that this is the case .","Chuz Life","351260","I accept your challenge.

I care much more about the rule of law and human rights. Unlike you, I don't find the justification for a woman to electively kill her child in pursuit of her personal convienience or health.","electrolyte","351303","I'm not interested in a formal debate on this specific topic. I don't even think that the question of the ""beginning"" of life is the most important question in the abortion debate, but it's a question that you are conveniently sidestepping, and you're doing so in an extremely dishonest way by presenting philosophy as science. Except for the right of a woman to maintain ownership of her body, clearly And I haven't seen justification for denying a woman the right to control her own body. I haven't seen justification for using the terminology that you are using, but I know your rationalization for it. If you were more precise with your word selection, you'd lose all shock value. Call it ""aborting the development of an embryo,"" which is -- for all intents and purposes -- a better description of the event in question, and you lose not only shock value but also lots of popular support.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","05:00 PM","abortion-debates","173"

That's a good one considering the threads I've started and primarily participated in . Yet, I'm confident that you would agree that one person's rights end where the rights of another begins. Am I right? Convieniently, you (and those in your ilk) have succeeded in denying the personhood of prebirth children,.. so (to you) there is no such conflict. But that doesn't mean the rest of the world has to share in your denialability. Does it. Abortion; ""It is what it is.""

The personhood question is just one issue. As I said earlier, I don't even think it's the most pertinent one. The rights question I think is more pertinent. The same could be said for you. The rest of the world doesn't have to accept that a clump of cells not only has rights but that those rights supersede the rights of an adult. I love it.

But many of us have already dealt with that question , answered it and moved on. As per the U.S. Constitution (I'm not interested in what the rest of the planet does) Our rights begin when our personhood does. (see amendments 5 and 14) I don't know where you get ""supersede"" from anything I've written,... But you're partially right. No-one has to accept anything any of us suggests. This is an arena for the battle of ideas. I'm encouraging all those who are willing to investigate for themselves; the things I claim. For me, when scientists determine that a person's aging begins at and by their ""conception ,..."" My background in logic leads me to conclude that their conception could also be the ""beginning"" of their individual life as well. Genetics and other observations so far seem to support that determination. Being that I read the 5th and 14th Amendments as pertaining to the ""biological aspects of ""personhood"" and not the ""metaphysical"" (souls and all that ####),... It is my ""opinion"" as supported by the facts I've found so far,... that an elective abortion is a violation of a pre-birth child's Constitutional human rights. Ok, so you disagree. You can't prove a negative (that a pre-birth child is not a person) but have fun with your attempts. However, you should be aware that every fact that proves they are individual human beings (persons) severely undermines your efforts.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","07:34 PM","abortion-debates","295"

The problem is that ""life,"" ""personhood,"" and ""possessing rights"" are not necessarily interchangeable. As per the U.S. Supreme Court -- which has the job of interpreting that Constitution -- zygotes, embryos, and most fetuses aren't ""persons."" But you're not letting that stop you, are you? Is it not a consequence of your position? I don't think that even you deny that a woman has a right to control her body. You're arguing that the rights of an embryo deny the woman the right to abort the pregnancy. What else would you call it? But I have, and I still challenge you. For example, see immediately below: Perhaps you're used to railroading people who don't have a good understanding of science. I want to discuss the science. I don't want a formal debate, where the objectives of learning and teaching unfortunately become secondary to convincing the judges who is correct. Specifically, I challenge your logic: First, we can define ""aging"" in a number of ways. For example, we can determine the ""age"" of a rock via a (and I'm taking some descriptive liberties here) chemical clock, but we don't call that rock alive. Alternatively, we can look at ""aging"" as a result of telomeric shortening, which will begin as soon as mitosis starts. Why does this necessitate the attribute of ""life""? Once again, what the hell do you mean by ""biological aspects of personhood""? You've shown no actual connection (and certainly not a scientific one) between ""aging"" and ""personhood."" Your argument amounts to, ""because A has B, I conclude C."" Ugh. And you say you have a background in logic. What poppycock. You're thinking of the impossibility of proving a universal negative. Proving negatives happens all the time. If you want me to show you, thus making you look like a complete imbecile, I'll be happy to. For this post, I'll instead simply point out that your assertion, ""you can't prove a negative,"" which you have presented as fact, is itself a negative . But that's really not even the issue. It's not my job to prove a negative. He who has the positive claim has the burden of proof. If I want to argue that an embryo does not qualify as alive, that burden of proof is upon me. If you want to argue that embryos have life, or personhood, or rights, then the burden of proof is upon you. See, this is the BS I'm sick of dealing with. I repeatedly challenge your ""scientifically"" based conclusions, but all you do is repeat the claim and say that it's a fact. You should be aware that such a statement is meaningless unless you can draw a necessary correlation between these facts and the idea that embryos are legally ""persons.""","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","09:28 PM","abortion-debates","584"

I do. ""Therefore, zygotes are persons"" is not a logical conclusion of ""aging begins at conception."" The whole point here is that I do object. You just got through saying that this is a forum for discussion of viewpoints, and now you're saying that you're not interested in pursuing that discussion? Yes, and that -- as a consequence -- your argument remains unsupported. I noticed. Plenty of people are just like you in that they see some information and decide that it confirms what they believe. You repeatedly brought up genetics and biology and how they allegedly support your point, so I told you that I wanted to talk about them in detail. Strangely enough, you've balked repeatedly at the offer. 1. You opened the door when you referred to your ""background in logic."" You proceeded to make a statement that you thought was a tenet of logic but was actually not, so I called you on it. You don't get to complain for being exposed as illogical. 2. Your continual reference to ""biological facts"" that you pretend actually support your point is tiresome, too. I keep calling you on it, and you keep pretending that it's not an issue. Given the opportunity to discuss the both the scientific findings and the conclusions that might be drawn from them scientifically (versus philosophically) with somebody who is qualified to do so, you're running away. 3. My previous post addressed a number of points -- some of which you introduced -- including interpretation of the Constitution, personal rights, and bait-and-switch terminology, but you elected to respond to none of them. I don't have to present a position in order to rebut yours. Period.
