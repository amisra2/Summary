It is simply because we are a nation which values life and is dedicated in every other instance to preserving and protecting it. Only do the voiceless unborn have no equal protection against being murdered and denied life for committing no wrong at all. In fact, they are allowed to be killed by the very person who precipitated the alleged problem of their conception. That is neither Just nor an equitable sollution for the inconvenience of taking personal responsibility for the situation the participants caused for a few hours of physical pleasure. Or in your case, a few seconds. So to be specific in my answer to you, we're not asking the nanny state to deny women any rights, we're asking the Government to protect the innocent unborn from the mass infanticide which kills approximately 1.3 MILLION UNBORN BABIES PER YEAR IN AMERICA ALONE. Actually, you soulless mysoginist, It is for love and respect for women that we feel as we do. Have you forgotten that fully half of the murdered unborn are women? And that the side affects from abortions which you so easilly ignore are very real and damaging to the spiritual and emotional security of the women who fall victim to this culturally encouraged and accepted form of genocide? No cap0, read it again. It says ""PERSONAL"" RESPONSIBILITY-AN ALL AMERICAN FAMILY VALUE!!! Must you even lie about what everyone can see in order to attempt to support your murderous agenda? Personal responsibility means to not murder the innocent result of what the irresponsible adults did in a state of uncontrollable lust.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","11:20 PM","abortion-debates","93"

A LOT MORE.","Chuz Life","352147","That is so unfair, jitobear. You have no idea how much some of us love woman. Especially those women close to us in our lives. We can't help that you were raped. It's not fair to equate any of us to the S.0.B. that attacked you on any level. Some of us (speaking for myself mainly) have put and kept women on pedestals our whole life. When my friends would want to go to t-itty bars for bachelor parties (even my own) I opted out... because I've always felt that those women were being taken advantage of, degraded etc. Then I had the chance once to try to talk some out of the profession. THAT was quite a learning experience! Still I revere women. Still I revere THOSE women. Including those who have had abortions. I seek those to point out to my daughter; who is and who is not a good role model for her as a woman ,... and I try to explain to her why they are good role models. You don't know how much ANY of us have in the way of respect for women, Jitobear. We can't undo the terrible things that happened to you. But I guarantee every decent guy you ever gave the ability to... would rather see that S.0.B. dead than to see him hurt another the way he hurt you. But where I draw the line (speaking only for myself here) is this; I will not sit quietly by and let someone use the unfortunate set of circumstances in something like a rape,... to justify the denials of the personhood and basic human rights to a child which was created NOT by a rape but by a consentual act of the (would be) mother. Children have a right to their life and they have a right to their life from the moment it begins. Not just from the moment that you or others like you can't stomache or justify the denial anymore. And you, I or no-one else can deny a child's life or rights except by due process. There IS (religiously supported or not) a Constitutional justification for allowing an abortion in cases of rape. Why that isn't enough to appease your concerns on this issue is certainly frustrating. But it doesn't mean we don't love and appreciate women,.. just because hold the positions that children have rights too.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","11:38 AM","abortion-debates","95"

"05-03-2009","12568",7,"Archangel","352150","In typical fashion you redact the meat of my statement, which if you truly understood it you would realize that pro-lifers are the true embracers of women's rights and defenders of innocent life. I made this complete statement. Actually, It is for love and respect for women that we feel as we do. Have you forgotten that fully half of the murdered unborn are girls?

Its honestly how I feel. The idea that you, the government, or any other stranger would usurp my right to make intimate medical decisions for myself puts me in a panic. Its like a strangle-hold on my throat. Its a violation. As a matter of fact when W became president I was so worried about my reproductive rights that I got my tubes tied. I wasn't even sexually active at the time. I'm still not. (Maybe you have caught on to the fact that I am brutally independent.) Girls whose lives will be meaningless if they do not have liberty. I don't believe you have respect for women at all. I think many lifers do, but not you. Your next statement would be why. A) This is really patronizing and you can take it and go to hell. Grown women are perfectly capable, intelligent beings. They don't need a some misogynist daddy figure telling them whats best for them. B) Nobody is out there encouraging women to have abortions. They always have and always will. They can just do so safely and legally now -- if they choose to .","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","12:56 PM","abortion-debates","101"

"05-04-2009","12568",7,"Lakrite","352080","So then explain to me what on earth it is you are thinking. The only difference between a baby born premature after 6 months and an unborn baby at 6 months is the location of the baby. One is in the womb, the other is not. If a baby of the same age can be killed in a womb, but not outside of it, you are putting more value on the born baby. You actually are making a value judgement. You need to explain why a baby can be killed inside the womb if another baby totally equal in all respects cannot be killed outside of the womb. Ownership seems to be the only possible reasoning, which would make the fetus property, thus devaluing it. Please clarify your position if it is not inline with what I am stating. Don't be circuitous, simply state your position clearly. I can say the same exact thing about a fetus...and by the way, a fetus is NOT part of the woman's body. It has a separate brain, separate organs...nobody would say that a mother has two separate hearts while pregnant; the baby has one, she has the other. A baby growing inside of a mother often does not even have the same blood type. People cannot have more than one blood type. So explain to me how a fetus is part of the mother's body. Furthermore, the fetus is not even of the same DNA. It has DNA of the father and mother. It is not at all a part of the mother's body. The fetus is simply living inside of the mother. That is the attitude of a close-minded person. You have to be open to knowledge and ideas. I have been convinced against my own positions before because I allowed an open mind. Close-minded people often ignore key facts and points and deny logic rather than try to understand it. Perfect example of the denial of logic. You say abortion is horrible, and you also say that it kills. You don't know how to fix it, and claim that I am not trying to. The logical thing to do to lessen the number of abortions would be to outlaw it. You deny that as a solution by bringing up the ""woman's body"" argument when it has continually been disproved. Outlawing abortion will be effective, as evidence shows in the only developed countries with outlawed abortion. Not a very sensible post. The issue is abortion and the life of the child. Obviously, if people argue for or against abortion they care about the issue. Enough with that argument already! I suppose that all pro-life women want to disempower themselves? Abortion disempowers men. There are several cases in which men want the child. Why is the woman the sole decider in what happens to the child? Often the argument is ""woman's body"" but the child is NOT the woman's body. If somebody is in my house, that person does not become my house... Would you like to state why abortion disempowers women? What rights does it actually take away from them? Control over their body? I think not; a woman's body cannot have two blood types or two unique DNA's... The ISSUE is the right to life of a child, born or unborn. The Pro-Choice side makes the issue about the rights of the woman. Pro-Life advocates understand the ""woman's body"" and ""disempowerment"" talking points, but most Pro-Choicers wont even argue against the right to life, and ignore the issue of the Pro-Life side.","jitobear","352508","I don't know. Maybe it is a kind of value judgement - but not between the babies. Each person deserves autonomy, freedom and personal rights. Pregnancy is a unique situation where two individuals are involved. If those two individuals needs are in conflict and only the rights of one can be supported - I believe that the fetus loses. The mother's rights supercede the fetus' - every time. I don't disagree with any of this but quit trivializing pregnancy. It impacts the health of the mother, drawing nourishment from her, changing her moods. The physical and emotional impacts of pregnancy are huge. It is not a benign relationship. Having complete and total control of my body is non-negotiable. Actually, I have a LOT of ideas. They have to do with education, health care, mentorship, addressing needs, and birth control. Actually you need to research that better. Half the world's abortions are unsafe or illegal abortions. The lowest incidences of abortion in the world are in developed nations, where there is access to health care, there are resources for expecting mothers and abortion is safe and legal. This information comes from the Guttmacher Institute. They are women's health organization that works with the WHO. They are frequently used by both pro-life and pro-choice organization for their information. There are ways to prevent unplanned pregnancy. Education and empowerment of women and girls is critical. Even in developed nations girls get the message that a woman without a man is a failure. Who wants to be a failure? Where do you think that will lead? Girls who are poor are at particular risk. They need mentorship. They need opportunity. Also - there are reasons women seek abortion. Addressing those reasons would also be a good start. Trivializing the realities of their life as ""selfish"" and removing their ability to make their own choices will not help. I got pregnant during college due to a birth control issue (slipped between when I was changing method). I was living in New Mexico at the time. I was a) worried about finishing my degree, b) I was told I could not get health care (I did not have insurance). Now someone could have come along and called me selfish, beat me over the head with a bible and showed me pictures of aborted fetuses OR my professors could have worked with me to ensure I was able to complete school and a clever and a non-judgemental woman at the state could have figured out to get me access to medical care. I will give you ONE GUESS as to which solution made it possible for me to have my baby. Now I am old broad, who doesn't date (or screw), is safe and has her tubes tied. That said, if I were to get pregnant today and that pregnancy were a) a serious threat to my HEALTH (not just my life), b) a serious threat to my livlihood or c) the result of rape - it will be ended. Laws be damned - it will be ended. Most women have their line in the sand. Now you can work with them, or rail against them and tie the hands of doctors which threatens women's access to complete and effective health care. Then why continue with these ineffective methods? Criminalization will just make abortion unsafe and give lifers a reason to pat themselves on the back, nor will you win hearts and minds with villification and trivialization. They can be. Many women are misogynistic. My father's mother comes to mind. But it does not mean they can stay when you want them to go. And although this situation sucks it is greatly over-shadowed by the number of women seeking abortion with either the support of the father or who are all alone. Yep. Don't be daft. Forcing a woman through a pregnancy against her will is controlling HER body. I get that. I just don't believe that the fetus' right to be born supercedes the rights of woman to have complete and total autonomy of their body.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","12:26 PM","abortion-debates","104"

You are essentially arguing that because the mother is in an unfortunate situation she has the right to kill her child to make that situation go away. The mother will not DIE during childbirth. You are not choosing between the life of the fetus and the life of the mother. In the case of a pregnancy where the mother would die, of course she can choose her own life because death to either the mother or her child would be certain. The effect of an abortion on the mother's growing child is far worse than mood swings and any emotional impacts. And think about this. A newborn baby ALSO puts emotional and physical stress on a woman. Crying all night long? Tiring the woman out? Changing diapers? That would surely be stressful. Hyper children running around the house would be physically and emotionally tiring for women. Why do the rights of the woman to kill the child not continue throughout the child's life? Pregnancy is not at all the only time in life where women experience physical or emotional stress. Whether it be the woman's child or her boss at work, just because she is stressed does not mean she can kill that boss or child. Thats fine. But the fetus is NOT your body. It just isn't. That is a fact. I have already gone into depth about the inaccuracy of stating that legality has no effect. Reread earlier posts. It is not accurate at all to compare developing countries with developed countries and then determine that because something doesn't seem to work in a developing country it wont work in a developed one. Ireland has one of the lowest abortion rates out of all the developing countries...and guess what? It has illegal abortion. It is also pretty much the only developed country with illegal abortion throughout. Of course. This should be done. But it does not justify at all the right to kill a fetus ever. Of course there are reasons. But the reasons do not matter. Whether the woman is afraid, has a bad family relationship, is worried her education will be hurt, her career, her parents, her own social life...all of that really isn't what matters most which is human life. The life being lost here is the life of the fetus. You do realize that institutes that help women cope with pregnancy are quite often pro-life? Nobody is advocating that the best solution to helping a woman get through her pregnancy is condemning her. If you believe that is the Pro-Life message you are completely off the message (not a surprise, the media tries to demonize pro-lifers) Once again, refer to earlier in this discussion. Country's that outlaw abortion see decreases in abortion rates. Do you have logic for why outlawing abortion would have no effect? So pro-life women are pro-life because they don't want women to have rights...please. Try again. Pro-life women realize that abortion is killing. Forcing a woman through pregnancy. Read that line. Forcing. Nobody forced the woman to get pregnant. Nobody forced her to have sex. And for the sake of God get it in your head that a fetus is NOT PART OF HER BODY! Yes, pregnancy effects women in many ways but abortions do not attempt to relieve these attitudes, their purpose is to kill an individual child. The fetus is not her body. She has every right to control her own body. When having sex, she knew that pregnancy was a possible option. She chose what to do with her body in the act of sex. Now she is faced with the responsibility of a child due to that sex. That child is NOT part of her body. She has absolutely no right to kill it. I understand that you believe women should have control over their bodies. I understand the many reasons women have abortions such as career, poverty, fear, and even guilt or shame when faced with family. I agree that we must educate people more about pregnancy and encourage people to practice abstinence if they do not want a child. I understand that a pregnancy can be both physically and emotionally hard for a woman. I understand every point made in favor of abortion. But each point ignores the main reason pro-lifers believe abortion is wrong. It kills a growing human being that is inside of the woman because of the natural process that is occurring due to sex. That child has every right to live! You shock me when you say that a baby born six months into pregnancy can not be killed but a baby in the womb after six months can be. That is honestly reminiscent of the idea of slavery. Two people, the only difference being skin color. Now the only difference is where the child is. The same idea of ownership over property is used today, but property is substituted with body. When slavery was abolished the southern plantation owners suffered terrible economic problems as the economy was destroyed. POVERTY. They were emotionally hurt as the witnessed their entire life crumble before them and watch as slaves that they paid for left. I can imagine how devastating it must have been for their entire families to go through. EMOTIONAL. But did those negative effects justify slavery? NO. Does the economic status and emotional effects of pregnancy on a woman justify abortion? NO. At least draw the parallel and acknowledge why abortion is so morally evil.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","06:41 PM","abortion-debates","105"
