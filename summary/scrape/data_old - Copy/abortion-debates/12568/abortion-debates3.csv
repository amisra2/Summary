"04-25-2009","12568",3,"electrolyte","351051","Historically, the abortion numbers were never lower than before contraception and abortion became hot-button topics in the 1960s. Why do you think legislation started changing then? People didn't start getting abortions because the law changed; the law changed because people started wanting abortions. Check the damn numbers already. It's not even a phenomenon restricted to the U.S. As these ""family planning"" options became understood, safe, and affordable, the demand for them increased, irrespective of law. To claim that I've argued that the numbers will increase as a result of elective abortion being banned is not only not supported by the historical facts, it's a big fat lie. Your insinuation is awfully dishonest. Why do you have to build a strawman to attack? Is it because you can't counter my actual argument?","Chuz Life","351093","Along with the availability of contraception, came the denial that an abortion kills a child. That having an abortion was tantamount to murder or manslaughter, etc. Much of that denial was due to the Courts ignorance on things like genetics, the science regarding aging and ""when a person's life begins"", etc. So, YES,.. the demand for elective abortion grew as a result of the ignorance and denials of the court. (Specifically the Supreme Court) There is a cause and affect relationship between the finding and conclusions of our courts and the tolerances of society as reflected in our laws. That being said,.. were the courts to overturn Roe v. Wade, recognize the scientific evidence regarding genetics, aging, etc... and establish the fact that an abortion kills a child and that it is tantamount to ""murder"" or manslaughter,... The laws and tolerances reflected in our society would be likewise reflected. This is different from prohibitions like banning booze, because there is no recreational value in having an abortion. And an abortion, unlike having a beer is not a ""victimless"" crime. To suggest that the demand for abortion would INCREASE as a result of banning it is therefor unsubstantiated. I was responding to Lakrite's post, not yours. If you do not believe that the demand for abortion will increase as a result of it being banned,... all you had to do is say so. It seems as though you agree that the demand will not increase as a result of abortion being recriminalized. And that's really all I needed to hear.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","10:46 AM","abortion-debates","32"
"04-26-2009","12568",3,"electrolyte","351256","I've invited you, multiple times, to have a discussion about the scientific merits of these conclusions, and you can't seem to make yourself do it. You've made your declaration sans evidence and reason and pretend that it's beyond reproach. What idiocy. There it is again, more idiocy. Nobody needs to recognize conception as the biological beginnings of a human life until somebody can actually provide an argument that this is the case .","Chuz Life","351260","I accept your challenge.

"04-26-2009","12568",3,"electrolyte","351256","Ah, so you acknowledge that women seek them regardless of the law . If you actually cared about people's health, you'd not argue against a system that makes these procedures safe.","Chuz Life","351262","While I do care (generally speaking) about people's health,.. I care much more about the rule of law and human rights. Unlike you, I don't find the justification for a woman to electively kill her child in pursuit of her personal convienience or health.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","01:03 PM","abortion-debates","39"

I don't even think that the question of the ""beginning"" of life is the most important question in the abortion debate, but it's a question that you are conveniently sidestepping, and you're doing so in an extremely dishonest way by presenting philosophy as science. Except for the right of a woman to maintain ownership of her body, clearly And I haven't seen justification for denying a woman the right to control her own body. I haven't seen justification for using the terminology that you are using, but I know your rationalization for it. If you were more precise with your word selection, you'd lose all shock value. Call it ""aborting the development of an embryo,"" which is -- for all intents and purposes -- a better description of the event in question, and you lose not only shock value but also lots of popular support.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","05:00 PM","abortion-debates","40"

That's a good one considering the threads I've started and primarily participated in . Yet, I'm confident that you would agree that one person's rights end where the rights of another begins. Am I right? Convieniently, you (and those in your ilk) have succeeded in denying the personhood of prebirth children,.. so (to you) there is no such conflict. But that doesn't mean the rest of the world has to share in your denialability. Does it. Abortion; ""It is what it is.""

The personhood question is just one issue. As I said earlier, I don't even think it's the most pertinent one. The rights question I think is more pertinent. The same could be said for you. The rest of the world doesn't have to accept that a clump of cells not only has rights but that those rights supersede the rights of an adult. I love it.

But many of us have already dealt with that question , answered it and moved on. As per the U.S. Constitution (I'm not interested in what the rest of the planet does) Our rights begin when our personhood does. (see amendments 5 and 14) I don't know where you get ""supersede"" from anything I've written,... But you're partially right. No-one has to accept anything any of us suggests. This is an arena for the battle of ideas. I'm encouraging all those who are willing to investigate for themselves; the things I claim. For me, when scientists determine that a person's aging begins at and by their ""conception ,..."" My background in logic leads me to conclude that their conception could also be the ""beginning"" of their individual life as well. Genetics and other observations so far seem to support that determination. Being that I read the 5th and 14th Amendments as pertaining to the ""biological aspects of ""personhood"" and not the ""metaphysical"" (souls and all that ####),... It is my ""opinion"" as supported by the facts I've found so far,... that an elective abortion is a violation of a pre-birth child's Constitutional human rights. Ok, so you disagree. You can't prove a negative (that a pre-birth child is not a person) but have fun with your attempts. However, you should be aware that every fact that proves they are individual human beings (persons) severely undermines your efforts.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","07:34 PM","abortion-debates","43"

The problem is that ""life,"" ""personhood,"" and ""possessing rights"" are not necessarily interchangeable. As per the U.S. Supreme Court -- which has the job of interpreting that Constitution -- zygotes, embryos, and most fetuses aren't ""persons."" But you're not letting that stop you, are you? Is it not a consequence of your position? I don't think that even you deny that a woman has a right to control her body. You're arguing that the rights of an embryo deny the woman the right to abort the pregnancy. What else would you call it? But I have, and I still challenge you. For example, see immediately below: Perhaps you're used to railroading people who don't have a good understanding of science. I want to discuss the science. I don't want a formal debate, where the objectives of learning and teaching unfortunately become secondary to convincing the judges who is correct. Specifically, I challenge your logic: First, we can define ""aging"" in a number of ways. For example, we can determine the ""age"" of a rock via a (and I'm taking some descriptive liberties here) chemical clock, but we don't call that rock alive. Alternatively, we can look at ""aging"" as a result of telomeric shortening, which will begin as soon as mitosis starts. Why does this necessitate the attribute of ""life""? Once again, what the hell do you mean by ""biological aspects of personhood""? You've shown no actual connection (and certainly not a scientific one) between ""aging"" and ""personhood."" Your argument amounts to, ""because A has B, I conclude C."" Ugh. And you say you have a background in logic. What poppycock. You're thinking of the impossibility of proving a universal negative. Proving negatives happens all the time. If you want me to show you, thus making you look like a complete imbecile, I'll be happy to. For this post, I'll instead simply point out that your assertion, ""you can't prove a negative,"" which you have presented as fact, is itself a negative . But that's really not even the issue. It's not my job to prove a negative. He who has the positive claim has the burden of proof. If I want to argue that an embryo does not qualify as alive, that burden of proof is upon me. If you want to argue that embryos have life, or personhood, or rights, then the burden of proof is upon you. See, this is the BS I'm sick of dealing with. I repeatedly challenge your ""scientifically"" based conclusions, but all you do is repeat the claim and say that it's a fact. You should be aware that such a statement is meaningless unless you can draw a necessary correlation between these facts and the idea that embryos are legally ""persons.""","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","09:28 PM","abortion-debates","44"

Nor is my threshold at template for others, for that matter. Your personal attacks on myself, my logic, etc. are fast growing tiresome. If you have a position that you feel is better supported by the facts. A position that is complete with your ""necessary correlation?"" Let's hear it. Hopefully you will be better at answering questions about the specifics of that position than you have been about forming questions about my own.","abortion-allows-men-abuse-womens-sexuality","09:42 PM","abortion-debates","45"
