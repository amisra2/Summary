No one should be forced to become a parent. Just how to legislate this, I don't know. There's so many different scenarios to consider. Like if it's a married couple, if the man didn't think she could get pregnant (she told him she was sterile, whatever), if the birth control failed, the father is a child under 18, etc. I know father's can relinquish their parental rights, but is that only if the mother allows it?

Historically, men could always walk away, condemn the woman as a slut, say that the child wasn't his and his word was always valued more than that of the woman. I must bring up the recent scandal involving Mary Kay LeTourneau, she served a sentence for rape because of her sexual involvement with one of her minor students--she married the student when he came of age, after he had fathered two of their children out of wedlock. There was an earlier scandal in her family, she was the child of noted rightwing conservative Republican Roman Catholic ex-Congressman John Schmitz, an elegant chap with a clipped mustache and two illegitimate children. In the tenor of those times, a woman was either a slut or a virgin or a chaste mother of many children whose paternity were assured, John Schmitz disavowed his illegitimate children and their mother, who was constantly ill because of diabetes, was their sole support. When she was accused of child abuse, the whole sordid history of Schmitz' involvement was revealed. She died because of her illness and the children became orphans--even though they were not really--and wards of the state. So much for Republican family values! Ptah!","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","11:22 AM","abortion-debates","22"

I read your post and can see that you are consistant and fair. You being a pro-choicer, I'm pleased that you see the fairness that men should have an opt-out period, like the woman. If under our laws we've concluded that the newly formed single cell or cells is just that a single cell(s) not yet of significant human developmental, and women can dispose of it at anytime, then men too should have the ability to dispose of it by terminating all of their responsiblity in the same time frame women have. Laws should never be crafted to suit certain individual or group interests. Laws should be crafted as if we all were the same, human beings! Race and gender should never be a factor in writing laws. People have to understand, when we read history, we read it and say, ""how barberic"" ""how ignorant those people were"". Well, I'm sorry to say, we too are barberic and ignorant if our laws and the definitions we create are only suited for a certain group of the population. We must understand that in the future, we will be enlightend with new technology and laws will be created due to new information. For example by what I mean, the artificial womb, I do believe, will be available for that single cell to develop completely. Then what? Laws will be re-visited and possibly changed to re-define that human being single cell. Many women won't want that single cell and for the first time in history men can actually have the means to develop a human being via the artificial womb. Let us define that living human-being single cell accurately today. If we don't, our future generations will look back upon us and say, ""Their ignorance made them barbaric; a mass genocide of human life in the billions"". Realize that the location of the living human-being single cell doesn't give the host (mother) full and complete ownership to do with whatever she so pleases. It will take technology in the future, for us to see, that the living, human-being single cell has two creators both equal in custody rights of that cell, regardless of location. Abortion in the future will have different liability to women. Killing a living human-being single cell without the consent of the male partner, knowing the partner wanted it and has the means to develop it via artificial womb, will have women in civil and criminal lawsuits, and losing! When the artificial womb is created, pro-lifers will still hold steady that life begins at the conception, and pro-choicers will finally have to commit to a time when life begins, no longer can they say, it depends on the situation. If a couple places a single cell in an artificial womb, and the man and woman die in a car crash four months later, that fetus must be addressed. Is it private property? Whose estate, the mother or father, or is this human being four months along an independent individual with civil rights like everyone else. In the future, in my heart I believe, a four month fetus will be classified a human being with the same inalienable rights as you and I. So what gives? Why would a fetus in the future be finally recognized as a human being with rights, as opposed to a fetus of yesterday and today who have no recognition of being a human being with rights? What will give way is our ignorance through technology and science. In the name of equality, when doing the right and fair thing was more important than fulfilling our greedy self-interests, slavery came to an end, and women suffurage prevailed. I too believe a sector of the human population (in utero) who have been denied their civil right, the basic right to continue life, will prevail, due to technology and science.","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","05:51 PM","abortion-debates","27"
"07-22-2006","8509",2,"None","None","None","SassyTeffie","224069","Ok, so men have to pay child support. If a man chooses not to pay support and the government finds him he gets his wages garnished for the current support as well as the support he should have been paying. I think a man should be allowed to opt out of this. Simply put, if the man chooses not to be a part of his child's life at all he should also be allowed to opt out financially. My husband had a child before we were married. Even though she cheated on him the entire time she was pregnant he still supported her through the pregnancy and took care of her medical bills. He now pays child support every month which leaves him with less money to support his three children he had with me. We know from friends that she is using the child support money to buy marijuana and alcohol and her parents are basically supporting both her and the boy. They are refusing to allow my husband to even see his son. The courts won't help until he gets an attorney (which we can't afford). So, now he's taking money from the three children for whom he is the sole supporter so that it can go to get his first son's mother high and drunk, and no matter how much he wants to be a part of his son's life he is not allowed. Finally, she has sent him the message that if he tries to become a part of his son's life she will move and disappear. Only her parents will know where she is so they can send her the child support checks, and since they do anything she asks them to they would never tell anyone where she is. So, why does my husband have to pay this money? Also, a man should have the choice to raise the child. I saw on this thread the comment that a woman would them have to go through the pregnancy and birth and still haveto pay child support, but that's a lie. Unless the father receives state assistance (money not child care, medical, or food stamps) he can choose not to ask her for child support. The same goes for the woman, but I have never heard of a woman not going after the guy for child support.","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","09:20 PM","abortion-debates","28"
