"","07-15-2006","8509","Caprii","None","a real pro-choicer would agree with matt dubay. It's all about choice, right? http://www.renewamerica.us/columns/kellmeyer/060317 Think about it. America is all about equality for man and woman. If the law of the land is abortion is legal because its not a significant being for a lack of better words and only a mass of tissue, then why can't a man opt out of fatherhood when a mass of tissue is just that a mass a tissue. Pro-choicers seem never to be about equal rights, so I'm pretty sure most of you pro-choicers will disagree with Matt, but to do so would make you a big hypocrite, do what I say, not what I do. Afterall, to pro-choicers life doesn't start at conception, in their mind, it doesn't start at anytime during the pregnancy. So really all matt wants to do is have equal say when a mass of tissue is at stake, he too should be able to execute his wishes or choice, like the woman can exercise her wishes or choice. Now that's is equality.","happygrl35","222511","As a pro-choicer I don't agree.The reason why a women gets to choose because it's HER body.No man is ever forced to be a father that IS his choice,but he is still obligated to support the child finacially once it becomes a seperate entity.Once a fetus becomes a seperate entity a mother can not even give her baby up for adption without the fathers consent,if the father doesn't consent he gains custody and the mother (although didn't want the child) is then obligated to pay support.Once a fetus becomes a seperate entity BOTH parrents are responsible.While the fetus is living in the mother only the mother can choose because it's HER body.Do you understand this?","real-pro-choicer-would-agree","abortion-debates","4","07:40 AM"

According to pro-choicers, life isn't conceived at conception, so if I man after having sex with a woman and the woman becomes pregnant, she is not pregnant with a baby, she is pregnant with a cell that can ""develop"" into a baby. If a man say's I opt out of fatherhood prior to the development of a human being, then he too like the woman already has, should have the opt-out option. A woman can do with her body what she so chooses, like she does, however, everyone including women must mitigate their own damages. If a woman who is pregnant with a few ""cell clusters"" and she so chooses to let the pregnancy of cells develop into a human being, she is allowed to do so, but she caused the development of a human baby not the man, and should be solely liable for such creation. Remember, when the man left after having sex, he did not create a human being according to pro-choicers, if at most he created a ""cell"". According to pro-choicers, cells do not translate into a human life. A male should have an opt-out period just like the woman, before the cells become a HUMAN BEING. God, I love it. Pro-choicers don't even want to live by their own words. I'm trying to understand their position. Its a ""cluster of cells"", ""a mass of tissue"", ""not a human being"", ""no heartbeat"" ""no brainwave therefore, not a human being yet"", so if a man say's I opt out of fatherhood prior to the creation of a human being then, like his female counterpart, should be able terminate his parental duty, that he never created, she did.

Our engagement last night is limited to last night and any product resulting from last night; a product of a possible single cell (not recognized by the US Supreme court as a human being). Therefore, upon receipt of this certified letter, I opt out on the ""single cell"" that resulted in our one-night stand. Furthermore, I've consulted ""Stem Sells, Inc."" and they will pay a premium of $5,000.00 for the cell you and I created to destroy and do research upon. The higher courts, know this single cell (or even a cluster of cells) is not a human being but merely a cell or cells and research and destruction can be done on said cells. Heaven forbid we research and destroy human beings, apparently this is not the case and our cell we created is just that a single cell insignicant to the world. Being that you are the host to our cell, and you have been given due notice of my choice and wishes of further development of our cell, I leave the cell in your custody to do what you will at your sole expense and solel responsiblity.

"","07-26-2006","8509","Caprii","None","Bell, as women, you and I are like rare open-minded individuals, neither one of us stating we are right but two of us trying to reach a happy median that is fair and balanced, and will make our minds up through science. I read your post and can see that you are consistant and fair. You being a pro-choicer, I'm pleased that you see the fairness that men should have an opt-out period, like the woman. If under our laws we've concluded that the newly formed single cell or cells is just that a single cell(s) not yet of significant human developmental, and women can dispose of it at anytime, then men too should have the ability to dispose of it by terminating all of their responsiblity in the same time frame women have. Laws should never be crafted to suit certain individual or group interests. Laws should be crafted as if we all were the same, human beings! Race and gender should never be a factor in writing laws. People have to understand, when we read history, we read it and say, ""how barberic"" ""how ignorant those people were"". Well, I'm sorry to say, we too are barberic and ignorant if our laws and the definitions we create are only suited for a certain group of the population. We must understand that in the future, we will be enlightend with new technology and laws will be created due to new information. For example by what I mean, the artificial womb, I do believe, will be available for that single cell to develop completely. Then what? Laws will be re-visited and possibly changed to re-define that human being single cell. Many women won't want that single cell and for the first time in history men can actually have the means to develop a human being via the artificial womb. Let us define that living human-being single cell accurately today. If we don't, our future generations will look back upon us and say, ""Their ignorance made them barbaric; a mass genocide of human life in the billions"". Realize that the location of the living human-being single cell doesn't give the host (mother) full and complete ownership to do with whatever she so pleases. It will take technology in the future, for us to see, that the living, human-being single cell has two creators both equal in custody rights of that cell, regardless of location. Abortion in the future will have different liability to women. Killing a living human-being single cell without the consent of the male partner, knowing the partner wanted it and has the means to develop it via artificial womb, will have women in civil and criminal lawsuits, and losing! When the artificial womb is created, pro-lifers will still hold steady that life begins at the conception, and pro-choicers will finally have to commit to a time when life begins, no longer can they say, it depends on the situation. If a couple places a single cell in an artificial womb, and the man and woman die in a car crash four months later, that fetus must be addressed. Is it private property? Whose estate, the mother or father, or is this human being four months along an independent individual with civil rights like everyone else. In the future, in my heart I believe, a four month fetus will be classified a human being with the same inalienable rights as you and I. So what gives? Why would a fetus in the future be finally recognized as a human being with rights, as opposed to a fetus of yesterday and today who have no recognition of being a human being with rights? What will give way is our ignorance through technology and science. In the name of equality, when doing the right and fair thing was more important than fulfilling our greedy self-interests, slavery came to an end, and women suffurage prevailed. I too believe a sector of the human population (in utero) who have been denied their civil right, the basic right to continue life, will prevail, due to technology and science.","happygrl35","224755","Great,if artificial wombs become avaliable then women can get zygote transplants rather then abortions,but the question for me is ""do zygotes have a right to life?""Why does mere biology automatically = right to life?
