"04-26-2005","4912",14,"Cone","None","The only way you can accuse God of murder is if you know that he killed someone unjustly. If you know this, you know more than God, because God, who is omniscient and just, obviously feels He has done no such thing. Good grief, Charlie Brown. Let me take you through the whole process so we can see if I have done any such thing Obviously you are unwilling to give anyone the benefit of the doubt. Thus, I took your statement and held it to your own standards, i.e., I did not give you the benefit of the doubt. Thus I said: His statment did not imply in the least bit that he did not think pregnancy is serious.","Linus","112697","Nope, I just know what murder is. Stop the spinningyou are making yourself dizzy. God isnt even omniscientit is just something it claims and is never proven. If god was all knowing then it would knowingly create people who would go to hell. It would knowingly create people who would be aborted, punished, oppressed and sinned. It would knowingly create people who would rise against him and later be outragedeven thought it knew it would happen. It knew and planned out the holocaust. It knew and planned out 9/11 terrorist attacks. It knew and planned out Stalins great purges upon the Ukrainians. And it would know all of this before the world was ever created. So basically you worship the greatest murder of all times; god. Thanks for making that clear. Goodness, if I knew you were going to get your underpants all tightly wadded up into a bunch over this I would have simply ignored it. Apparently you must have more free time then I do in these petty matters to make a post that wasnt even written to you in the first place. It appears you are attempting to compensate for a lack of relevancy in this topic by engaging in some of the most irrelevant. First, I dont dispense the will to doubt unless there is something to give doubt in the first place. Do you have a problem with that? VOR hasnt expressed any disagreement by this so why do you care? VOR has sat by and took it without correcting me at all. Second, where is your outrage against VOR for not giving women the benefit of the doubt? VOR collectively calls the majority of women have abortions out of comfort but I dont see you consoling him to give them the benefit of the doubt. So I guess your outrage is only selective. Unless you are VOR or should I give you the benefit of the doubt and suggest that you are posting under two different screen names? I wouldnt want to trample upon your toes anymore then I have. Maybe you are. No, you just had a knee-jerk action which I simply blew over as that. You are just reacting out of being spiteful and fortunately I dont put too much worth into the posts made by users committing intellectual fraud. If you have ever dared to read any of my posts you would have known I dont view it as such. Goodness, you are foaming at the mouth. Just nit picking to find a way to attack me it appears. No, his statement did not but his statements as a collective have. I simply stated my opinion that he doesnt take pregnancy, esp. if unwanted, as serious. VOR has been slandering abortion as a reason done mostly out of convenience. The nature that anyone can whittle down such a situation as merely being an issue of comfort shows not only a lack of insight about how stressful pregnancy is but also apathetic to their plight. If VOR wants to believe women have abortions because they had a bad day or their head hurts and if so I would label him as that; someone who doesnt take unwanted pregnancies serious. You know, it really speaks volumes when you make a post that is entirely irrelevant to the topic and to you, but also apparently condone such a statement as VORs over nailing someone for not giving someone the benefit of the doubt. If I were still pro-life I would be embarrassed by VOR.","christian-cant-support-abortion","05:19 PM","abortion-debates","196"
"04-26-2005","4912",14,"Linus","None","90% of Americans identify themselves as Christians.60% of Americans support Roe v Wade. Christians make up the majority of abortion patients here in America. And yet no where in the Bible is their a direct condemnation of abortion. The abortion issue has never hurt the Democratic base. On the other hand, the pro-life platform of the GOP has hurt it with voters. Why do you think democrats use abortion as the litmus test in elections?","Hunter","112700",""" Thou shalt not murder.""","christian-cant-support-abortion","05:36 PM","abortion-debates","197"

That is simply the end of the story. If you want to complain about that, start your own thread. You're never going to convince someone who believes the whole Bible that God is unjust merely because you say so.","christian-cant-support-abortion","08:08 PM","abortion-debates","200"

And now 14 pages later it comes to a crushing hault...a defeat. For all of you who cry no one can be Christian and support abortion; your belief is intellectually bankrupt. Even your god, Jesus and bible doesn't support you.","christian-cant-support-abortion","08:48 PM","abortion-debates","201"

I tell you the truth, anyone who is a proponent of murdering unborn children is risking their very soul. For those of you who think that abortion is okay; I say that ya'll must have your heads so far up your rectums that it would take blasting powder and Federal troops to remove your heads from your rectums. You pro-abortionists are utterly and completely insane. Thats not surprising to me, as most of you XXXXXX are also liberals. Abortion is an abomination to God and man. I have asked this several times and will ask it again. Who among you posting here wishes that they had been aborted?","christian-cant-support-abortion","11:31 PM","abortion-debates","204"

So now information is only viable if it comes from a non-geocities website then? Because paying for a web service means you are more informed? Even your Bible Study website is obviously swings to the right with adds against homosexuality however that doesn't dismiss the point of it's information. Wow, Steve, once again you predictably attack the messenger while the message sails on by over your head. So now we are pitting sources against each other based upon the website instead of the content? And now you commit the fallacy of appealing to authority? Sorry, having a PHd doesn't make you right. Wow, I just cant make you happy. If I use this site you cry it is anti-Christian and if not you attack the web service. How pathetic...is this what you have responded back with? A complaint about the source? Man, you are an ungraceful loser. Keep it upyou still havent proven anything. P.S.
