"04-23-2005","4912",2,"Steeeeve","None","It shows by the way, only the creator of life can take it away according to the Bible.","Linus","111160","Thanks, Christianity worships a blood thirsty God who is too wicked and morally bankrupt to worship. It is below me and I can not take authority from such a moral midget. According to Stalin, only your caretaker, the USSR, can take away your life. God has alot in common with dictators. And often the apologists for dictators have alot in common with apologists such as yourself.","christian-cant-support-abortion","01:49 AM","abortion-debates","16"
"04-23-2005","4912",2,"Cone","None","Or could it be possible that God, as the sovereign and just Creator of the universe, through his divine will, could have orchestrated the world in such a way, that there was not one pregnant person on the earth during this time period?","Linus","111161","Yep, the same sovereign creator who gave parents the right to slaughter their unruly children just POOF made everyone magically become unpregnant so it could ease the conscious of those who oppose abortion hundreds of years later and not find themselves feel conflicted over worshipping a supernatural abortionist. Or did god just kill millions of unborn babies because he knew hundreds of years later their would be Christian apologists who find ways to sugarcoat his brutalities? I suppose the later would take less effort in the end. But God never said he stopped people from giving birth or having babies so I assume he just went ahead and slaughtered them none the less. Wow, some divine being you worship. Killing tiny little unborn babies. What a tough guy! Sure showed them something about morality!","christian-cant-support-abortion","02:01 AM","abortion-debates","17"
"04-23-2005","4912",2,"Steeeeve","None","This coming from the person that makes insane claims without providing evidence. Atleast provide some when asked! I guess the many quotes I posted don't count then huh? Sure it doesn't say ""abortion is wrong""...however if you believe in the Bible you believe that it provides an answer to this question. And it does...as provided earlier.","Linus","111164","I see we have went to attacking the messenger instead of the message. A very common tactic of those who cannot provide any relevant insight to the subject. Keep attacking me while the message sails right over you. I just debunked all of your claims. The Bible says nothing on abortion so stop trying to act like it does. If you want to be one of the many televangelists who pick and choose their way through the Bible to support their political agendas then be my guest. But the Bible is silent on abortion. Thus you can't cry that Jane Fonda isn't a Christian because of her views on abortion.","christian-cant-support-abortion","02:07 AM","abortion-debates","19"
"04-23-2005","4912",2,"Steeeeve","None","You quote as evidence a site that doesn't provide an Bible versuses? Great proof :-/ Not only that but it is RELIGIOUSTOLERANCE.ORG!! I mean really. How anti-christian can you get? Your biased website states very few examples and even goes as far as to say Exodus is translated wrong. Your website is just false on this and I don't know where they got their BS from. The fact that you copied your whole arguement from this website says enough about you. Not to mention the numerous other quotes I gave you about how a person (in the Christian faith) is formed before conception! This shows that God has already created you. God also talks about how you can't kill a person he created. This is an easy concept to follow.","Linus","111166","Wow, again, you attack the messenger instead of the message. You cannot possibly disprove what they say and thus you are rendered to only attacking them because you could never possibly defeat the message. You are using desperate attacks and are forced to fighting on your knees. Why dont you get on your feet and instead rise to the occasion? If you want to use bias as a way to disprove a message then I suppose I have already won every argument against every pro-lifer because they are biased. Everyone is biased. If you want to use that as a prerequisite for proving something as being valid then youll never find a valid message. What did I copy? Please, the fact that you claim I just copied and pasted something says something about you and it isnt very flattering. Yep, a person of the Christian faith is never biased. How nave. Formed from conception? How is this possible if the bible was written thousands of years before the discovery of conception by modern science? Your argument is skewed once again. So? God told his followers to kill thousands of people that he created within the Bible. I suggest you read the Old Testament.","christian-cant-support-abortion","02:23 AM","abortion-debates","20"
"04-23-2005","4912",2,"chloe","None","Linus, What about the passage that Cone was talking about?","Linus","111168","Jeremiah only proves God has foreknowledge. Foreknowledge does not equal opposition to abortion.","christian-cant-support-abortion","02:31 AM","abortion-debates","22"

If you read the Bible you can't draw the conclusions he or she did. Thats like reading ""I am the way"" from the Bible and assuming it means that God is not the way. It just doesn't make sense. I guess we can let the viewers of this thread decide however when the Bible has the same word for adult as it does for fetus and that God says he creates you before you are in the womb and that you can't kill a person...what conclusion does a rational person draw? You are kidding me right? It says ""created before he was in the womb""...What do you think that means. Wow. And? You make it seem as if God is not allowed to kill anyone. The Bible never says God can't. I would say the naive person is the one that thinks the Bible doesn't say anything about abortion. If you are Christian you believe the Bible WOULD talk about an issue like this...in fact your website argees on this. It always talks about slavery and many other issues. Now what does it say about abortion? Well it says you can't kill a person. God defines person as before being concieved even!!!! The person that argrees differently has not read the Bible nor taken the time to understand it. You have disproved nothing.","christian-cant-support-abortion","02:31 AM","abortion-debates","23"
"04-23-2005","4912",2,"Linus","None","Jeremiah only proves God has foreknowledge.

Going with other things God said..we can say God doesn't prove you killing people. It doesn't say abortion...but it does say you can't kill someone in the womb. We have a word for that now..abortion.","christian-cant-support-abortion","02:34 AM","abortion-debates","24"

Your post-hoc conclusions arent working and so far this supposed verse that directly proves abortion is wrong in the Bible has not been brought up. Another post-hoc conclusion. Have any of you people taken a class in debating or logic? Conception would be the moment when sperm and egg are fused together. It does not mean created before he was in the womb. You need to re-read what I posted to. The original post just said God doesnt allow people to kill his own creations. I provided otherwise. That wouldnt be any of us here then. I have said the Bible says nothing directly about abortion and so far none of you can prove this. If you guys want to pick and choose whatever bible verse that might support your political beliefs be my guest. Youll get the same results but you still havent proven a direct one and you are just wasting my time. Where within my website did it say being a Christian means you need to believe the Bible says something about abortion? You see, all you are doing is amusing me with your simplistic tactics. Try something else. You arent gaining ground. The Bible says you cant kill a person? WRONG! The Bible is filled with countless stories of god sanctioned aggressive warmongering, genocide, pillaging, plundering, wanton destruction, sexual slavery, rape, misogyny, child abuse, homophobia, unfair laws, cruel and unusual punishment, the punishment of innocents, and brutal chattel slavery. God defines birth as following the commonly held Jewish belief that people are made from soil and lifted into the bellies of their mothers. Conception is a modern discovery, not biblical. Before you attempt to preach about what is in the Bible why dont you read it? Blindly saying stuff that you might think is cool or neat in the Bible is no longer cutting it.","christian-cant-support-abortion","02:52 AM","abortion-debates","25"

If God didn't want us killing someone in the womb then why did he order his followers to murder unborn babies of the Mideanites and Amalekites? How can you explain the barbaric tale of Numbers 5?","christian-cant-support-abortion","02:58 AM","abortion-debates","26"
