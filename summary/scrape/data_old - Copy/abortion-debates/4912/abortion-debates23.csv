It's both an incredibly robust, and incredibly delicate system, capable of amazing feats of strength, wonderful miracles, and at the same time can be destroyed with a sewing needle. Look at a strand of DNA and all it has to hold. Hair color, eye color, skin color, height, weight, gender, genetic predisposition to diseases, etc. how could something so intricate and complex not be the handiwork of a higher being?","christian-cant-support-abortion","09:19 AM","abortion-debates","332"

Robust, delicate, strength, intelligent, best, successful etc are always relative to something else and really pretty meaningless if you think about it. The most successful organisms, bacteria, have been on the planet for a hell of a lot longer then people have. If we destroy ourselves with nuclear weapons next week, who would have been the most successful species? As far as design goes, why do we have vestigial components, wouldn't a smart designer just leave off parts that don't do anything? People crave sugar, fatty foods and love to overeat but it's bad for them, why wouldn't a smart designer have made us crave only healthy food? Lot's of people have back problems and it's attributed to the poor design of the back which is obviously better suited for use horizontally. Lot's of people have died from choking, wouldn't a smart designer have separated the air intake hole from the food intake hole so that does not happen? Imagine that i ask you to design the 2012 Corvette, but I then say you must start with a Model T and add things to the outside to make the new car. That is exactly how your brain is made, it's layered with the most primitive parts in the center. You have two sets of vision and hearing areas in the brain the inner most ones being the more primitive, only the outer most ones are used, why? Human beings are poorly designed in many respects, I don't think anyone as powerful as god would want to own up to it.","christian-cant-support-abortion","10:56 AM","abortion-debates","335"

Besides nobody ever said God was striving for the perfect creation when we were being designed. But that doesn't change the fact that the human body is far too intricate to be the result of random chance of design.","christian-cant-support-abortion","11:06 AM","abortion-debates","336"

"04-29-2011","4912",23,"Accipiter","428608","You have two sets of vision and hearing areas... only the outer most ones are used.","Symbiote","428652","Is this true? I studied psych with several neurobiology modules and this never came up, the general thrust, as I understood it, was that people use their entire brains. My understanding was also that the brain is rather plastic (malleable), and intelligence or other mental abilities give a pretty good evolutionary advantage, so redundant brain areas shrink or disappear rapidly. If you could provide a reference I would find it fascinating.","christian-cant-support-abortion","07:07 PM","abortion-debates","338"

That doesn't count as abortion in today's sense does it?

D who is a professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University, click the link called Download MP3 to listen to it: David J Linden - The Accidental Mind | Point of Inquiry It's an interesting and easy to understand interview with no heavy scientific understanding of the subject necessary, anyone can enjoy it and I recommend it to everyone, I hope it will ignite other debates as well.","christian-cant-support-abortion","04:10 PM","abortion-debates","341"

A Perfect Being would be incapable of Creating imperfection. If ""God"" is perfect then everything he says, or does is Perfect.. So considering the imperfections of Humans I guess it's safe to assume God don't exist. Again, the Christian belief is that God is all knowing and all Powerful. If He is All Knowing, and knows what will happen from the day you are conceived, then every murder, suicide, and Abortion can be blamed on God. If he knows a Child will be aborted before it's born then what would be the purpose of allowing that child to be conceived?.. Just more Logical proof that God is a figment of man-kinds imagination.","christian-cant-support-abortion","10:46 AM","abortion-debates","342"

I am not saying that you have no right to..just that your argument cannot have any conviction. By making a statement about God and when challenged abandoning that very statement and claiming he was an imaginary being confirms this. And yes, it does make far more sense..to you.","christian-cant-support-abortion","11:24 AM","abortion-debates","345"
