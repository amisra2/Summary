"04-23-2005","4912",5,"Linus","None","No. It doesn't. You are just forging links and it is starting to look depserate and sloppy. I am not here to prove your points. That is your job. Never. However if we had to guess I would think abortion was permitted in Hebrew society.","chloe","111339","Sloppy Joe Sloppy, Sloppy Joe Sloppy Joe Sloppy Sloppy Joe. You are living in lunch lady land. Here is an obvious link. We have seen that in the Bible, people are viewed as persons while in the womb. We have also seen that murder is unlawful. Conlusion: Murder of those persons in the womb is unlawful. How hard is that? Points have been proven. Guess all day long if you want. You are waisting your time cause it is black and white.","christian-cant-support-abortion","04:32 PM","abortion-debates","63"
"04-23-2005","4912",5,"Steeeeve","None","Under your thinking yes..it would be. obviously not, you are stating that if the opinion of the community changes then Gods view on abortion changes. This is not the case. You are just getting random facts from ""religioustolerance.org"" without even knowing if what they say is right or not. http://www.biblestudy.org/question/notkill.html is a site offering another ""side"" to the story. This is amusing though Linus...keep it up","Linus","111344","Only under your thinking. Apparently you believe rights cannot be implied through the constitutioneven though the Supreme Court disagrees with this. Nope, read again. I am stating the definition of rasach and proving abortion doesnt apply to any to it. Rasach is a relative term and if God didnt want it to be done as so then he would have used a more absolute term. I see you never took Bible History then and understand that Christian sects have different implications of the original ten commandments. You can even see this between the Catholic and Protestant denominations when it comes the ten commandments but this is a separate subject in itself. However I am going by the original word of god and reading the way the ten commandments were written at first. If you dont like it because it huts your argument then too bad. The ten commandments of today are very much dumbed down versions of the original. Kill was made to substitute murder and murder was made to substitute rasach in the 6th Commandment. Interpretations between Hebrew, Latin, Greek and then to other dialects often get mixed up and lose their true meaning as I just demonstrated. For example, even the word homosexual cannot be found within the Bible because there was never a Greek word for it in Biblical times. And no, much to your blind anti-religious tolerance.org bias, the source for this comes from Rabbi Balfour Brickner, National Director of the Commission on Interfaith Activities and author of Finding God in the Garden. So do I need to expect youll hate all Jews now because one of them disagrees with your perverted use of the six commandment? I wish I could say the same when you attempt to act cocky and just get knocked back on your posterior when I debunk. Unfortunately, I find it very annoying. You can only hit a punching bag so many times until it gets boring.","christian-cant-support-abortion","04:50 PM","abortion-debates","64"

So if god told you to perform abortions for the rest of your life you would do it then, right? And still be pro-life too?","christian-cant-support-abortion","04:53 PM","abortion-debates","65"

All you did was re-write the same argument but vomited it out before but this time using different words. Abortion is not unlawful. You havent even proven it as such yet.

Now that I have become pro-choice I found that was lied/misguided alot by the previous movement. You people have no idea how much your leaders lie to you. Nor how much is critically censored. Or how they screw you over. It has been +30 some years and you people still give money to the GOP for their lip service against abortion. And none of you are outraged by it. I don't understand your question. Why is it only applying to women with just headaches and bad nights? Last time I checked abortion was legal for all women.","christian-cant-support-abortion","05:24 PM","abortion-debates","68"

We are discussing what the Bible says about the issue of abortion not what you or I or augustine or the pope or anyone else says about it. We have proven that it is Biblical to say that abortion/murder of the person in the womb is unlawful. That means that the Biblical and true Christian stance on the issue of abortion is that it is unlawful. Linus, I dont understand. The actual words have been given to you. Yet you ignore them. If you have a point to prove then prove. Or if you already feel you have, show me where you have proven that it is not Biblical to say that abortion is wrong.","christian-cant-support-abortion","05:32 PM","abortion-debates","69"

We weren't talking about my thinking now were we. I am asking if you believe that the constitution says the word abortion? You claim the Bible never talks about abortion and therefore you can't say God thinks it is wrong. Well using that logic you would say that banning abortion is not unconstitutional because it never mentions the word abortion. Is this what you think?","christian-cant-support-abortion","05:44 PM","abortion-debates","72"

"04-23-2005","4912",5,"Voice Of Reason","None","""Just let the judges that president Bush nominated and you just might not be so cynical..."" Because a lot of women get abortions for convenience......","Linus","111384","Please, you think big bad abortion waffler Bush is going to outlaw abortion in the next three years? Empty threats do not frighten me. Bush is still wondering why he gave a couple million to abortion clinics in Africa under his AIDS policy but didn't for the UN Family Planning Fund. You guys had your chance to nominate a real pro-lifer in 2000 but you blew it on a drug-abusing, New England pseudo-cowboy who holds no real convictions on the issue. The right-to-life faction is so weak it couldn't even save Terri Schavio despite Bush being president, his brother being govenor of Flordia and 21 republican nominated judges. Your movement is weak. Keep voting GOP, keep voting for failure. Us liberals are counting on it. Because pregnancy is just a minor inconvenience for all women, right? A big XXXX over that doesn't mean anything. Keep thinking that way. The less you understand about those having an abortion the more it helps us. We are here to help, we are here to take a woman's crisis seriously and not deface it as being a matter of ""inconvenience.""","christian-cant-support-abortion","06:55 PM","abortion-debates","75"
