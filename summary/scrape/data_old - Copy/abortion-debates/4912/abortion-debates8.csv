Thank you, I'll remember to use that on someone else of with little knowledge of fallacies. heheheh. I wonder if you get the irony of it all.","christian-cant-support-abortion","05:43 PM","abortion-debates","108"
"04-24-2005","4912",8,"Duo_Maxwell","None","Oh yes, it's because you're a hypocrite Class after me: VOR is a HYPOCRITE Voice of treason is a HYP-O-CR-ITE Then you are a hypocrite as you attacked Daewoo as a Bush hater merely because one Then you have no problem voiding straight marriages that engage in anal? hypocrite. He is a lying hypocrite. Would you get me banned if I proved you had lied? Except VOR, you said that polls don't matter. Oh yes, that's because you are a lying hypocrite.","Steeeeve","111668","Duo, The ONE link you provided to show that VOR is a hypocrite was a link to whistlestopper.com If you honestly believe that he is a hypocrite then give us an exact page of posts that show this. We don't have time to read the last 500,000 posts on that website to see whether or not he is a hypocrite. So either you back up your claim or we will just assume he is not a hypocrite. At the same time we will assume that in the event you try to call someone out again, you will have no credibility because all you have done is smear him without providing proof. How you like if I said you are a hypocrite and the proof is here.. www.4forums.com . This makes no sense. Stop calling people hypocrites with no backing!!! You just make yourself look bad. For those wondering....Duo has posted the word ""hypocrite"" in 21 threads and some 35 posts most if not all WITHOUT ANY PROOF . Here are some examples of you calling VOR a hypocrite without backing it up with anything more then a general link and none of these even had a link to prove he is a hypocrite: AND THAT IS NOT EVEN ALL OF THEM!!!!","christian-cant-support-abortion","06:33 PM","abortion-debates","109"
"04-24-2005","4912",8,"None","None","None","Duo_Maxwell","111674","did u even read the context? Did you notice that he contricts himself in the same thread? The calls people bush haters and then cries foul when someone attacks him on personal insults. I didn't think so. Besides the link I gave was a search function. Sheesh.","christian-cant-support-abortion","06:51 PM","abortion-debates","110"
"04-24-2005","4912",8,"Duo_Maxwell","None","You have obviously missed where VOR supports the murder of abortion doctors, pedophiliacs and other groups.","Cone","111679","You have yet to back this claim up with any evidence whatsoever. Prove this point, or recant the accusation.","christian-cant-support-abortion","06:56 PM","abortion-debates","111"
"04-24-2005","4912",8,"None","None","None","Steeeeve","111681","Actually, I read all of the things were you called VOR a hypocrite and not ONE time did you actually prove so. In fact most of the time you just said he was a hypocrite. There was nothing that VOR said that hypocritical.","christian-cant-support-abortion","06:57 PM","abortion-debates","112"

He attacks a number of people as bush haters, and yet he cries foul when he is attacked, citing personal attacks. How is that not hypocritical? When one insults people but then says it's wrong for people to do the same action, doesn't that make him a hypocrite? Please, defend VOR. I don't defend complete XXXXXX, you clearly do. Cone: no. I'm not going to recant something you are too lazy to check. I'm going to make VOR's life as unpleasant as possible. It is quite clear neither of you two have dealt with him enough to realize that defending him is stupid. Of course, you two are on the end of the curve as a number of people have realized that to do such is utterly retarded. P.S: Do you know why I directly link the specific post when replying to VOR and I don't do it for you two? Because I assume you two are smart enough that you can find it on your own.","christian-cant-support-abortion","07:00 PM","abortion-debates","113"
"04-24-2005","4912",8,"None","None","None","Duo_Maxwell","111695","does it matter? http://4forums.com/political/search.php?searchid=36638 Looks like he is attacking people with that catch phrase. That's just here. Not to mention he uses a number of insults. http://www.whistlestopper.com/forum/...earchid=242628 That's just 30 with the search function of Bush hater.","christian-cant-support-abortion","07:10 PM","abortion-debates","115"
"04-24-2005","4912",8,"None","None","None","Steeeeve","111696","VOR may never well be a hypocrite, however, just stating a link that has no posts on it and making us do a search is not gonna cut it. There is no reason for me to do a search because I am going to assume he is not a hypocrite. YOU are the one calling him out so YOU gotta provide the evidence. Until then, just shut up about him being a hypocrite when you aren't proving it! We have gotten so off topic here","christian-cant-support-abortion","07:11 PM","abortion-debates","116"

I looked for places he directly said this, and I've looked for the four posts you claim to prove it. I have not found them. Now, you keep saying this proof is easliy available. Yet it is non-existent. You have already proved yourself to be a hypocrite today, do you insisit on proving yourself a liar too? I'm not defending VOR. I'm dismissing your infantile ""I know you are but what am I?"" rhetoric.","christian-cant-support-abortion","07:12 PM","abortion-debates","117"

I did the search for you. SUPREME argument by laziness HELLO. All you need to do is the click on the link.
