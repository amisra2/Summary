AS for your military service: VOR isn't even old enough to enlist STOP LYING","Steeeeve","111896","In the first three you imply that VOR thinks saying someone is a ""Bush Hater"" is an insult. Where does VOR say this is an insult? If so, he would be a hypocrite, however, from further reading of them, I don't think he was using as an insult at all. I will say calling you ""little man"" is an insult and probably has more backing for calling him a hypocrite. However, if I find a link from you saying that name calling is bad then you would be guilty of the same thing right? You implied that VOR DOESN'T believe in ""voiding straight marriages that engage in anal""...however you have no provided no evidence to show his views on anal sex with regards to straight marriages. Therefore how can you call him a hypocrite? In your post you provided no evidence of what he said about polls. Thus your claim was unfounded which is what we are saying you do. If this was true you should of posted a place where he(VOR) said that polls don't matter. Otherwise, like I said, your claim is unfounded. You didn't even come close to providing proof here...In fact, VOR (in the post you quoted him) never said anything about his opinion...he said some people think...this by no means shows his beleifs. So why did you try and call him a hypocrite on it? You once again made an unfounded claim. As for your last link...it goes along with the your first link I believe except you added this: you provided NO proof whatsoever of VORs age and/or enlistment statis in the military. This would be another example of an unfounded claim. Lets add them up: At BEST: VOR being a hypocrite provided with facts: 1 Unfounded claims by Duo: 4 Duo, come on now.","christian-cant-support-abortion","12:59 AM","abortion-debates","167"

However, you were claiming VOR was a hypocrite to which no one knew anything about VOR. So why should we have taken your word for it? Lets assume I had no idea that grass was green because I had never seen grass....If you just came on and said ""grass is green"", they I would have said you claim is unfounded. Nevertheless, claiming someone is a hypocrite is probably requires more evidence then a simple claim like the grass is green as it is a personal attack. It seems all of your posts when you quote VOR include that he is a hypocrite and yet you refuse to provide evidence in all of them. So, I got tired of your unfounded claims and decided to call you out on them. If you simply provide evidence to back your claims then it wouldn't be a big deal now would it? However, you have yet to provide evidence for your unfounded claims. If they are YOUR claim YOU should provide the evidence...not me. So call me lazy all you want but it appears many people see the way I do (zachvac and cone as shown in this thread). In conclusion, You can make unfounded claims about people all you want, however, it doesn't make them true and in the end you look like a fool. Just take our advice and post evidence to back your claims about other people on the forum. For those just joining us: Don't by any means think that Duo (or anyone) has done anything wrong or has been proven wrong. We are just simply telling him to ground his claims in provided evidence so they don't look like ""because I said so"" arguements..","christian-cant-support-abortion","01:30 AM","abortion-debates","171"

"04-25-2005","4912",12,"Steeeve","None","Rashach : To murder, slay. I don't know where you get something differently. After looking up some stuff I found out that miscarriage is not used. Yatsa is the word that is commonly misused to mean miscarriage while here is means to give birth. This is clear because later on the writter refers to a miscarriage using the word shakal. So in conclusion we can determine this quote to mean you can't kill the baby inside the mother. For a further explanation of this I have found a link that kinda says this Liberals are losing a lot these days. Every one of them? The constitution says nothing about abortion either. How are they implied rights? Maybe the Bible implies that you can't do abortion? In case you forgot you said ""abortion is not mentioned in the Bible therefore it is ok"" ...so I asked if you believed banning abortion is unconsitutional...you never really answered but if you said YES then you would be inconsistent in your views because the constitution never mentinos the word abortion at all...if you can't imply abortion in the Bible how can you in the constitution? I still don't see your point about Christians supporting abortion for hundreds of years...THey supported slavery too and this was against the Bible. I go by the Bible and it says you can't murder a person and also says a fetus is a person. Not only that, in Exodus it says if you kill the unborn you pay the price as if you murdered. So silent on abortion? No. Have you proven the Bible is silent? Not even close. Keep working at it.","Linus","111913","Because you use contemporary Hebrewnot classic, which is hundreds of years outdated like Old English. The grammar and definition have changed for many words in Hebrew since the reestablishment of Israel. Understandably, the community part would be dropped off so rashach would sound similar to the more accepted definition of murder. However splitting hairs isnt going to do you any good either. Your site is just using the regular old contemporary translation of Exodus 21 that I pointed out earlier. For thousands of years Rabbis translated it as this; if a woman is injured then it is an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life. If the fetus is injured then it is only a small crime that and those responsible must pay a fine according to the father. As such, even such a law was reflective in all other surrounding cultures. You dont have to go far into Judaism to see that Jewish culture didnt really cherish fetal life since an embryo is not reckoned a viable living thing (in Hebrew, bar kayama). Even the phrase adopted to unborn children is ubar yerech imo-- which deems the fetus as being part of the pregnant woman's body. If the webmaster to your site wants to play history revisionist because he thinks Exodus 21 should be interpreted differently from the way it has been done traditionally for many centuries then so be it. It doesnt change history or the original interpretation. And yet it still doesnt say anything against abortion. Try again. No, even if the Jews had translated it as such it would not condemn abortion. By your interpretation a man is being punished for wrongfully killing a fetus. This doesnt bar the parents from attaining an abortion. Once again you are using a logic fallacy. If situation Z provides punishment Y then situation X would provide punishment Y too. Your logic doesnt make any sense. Indeedwe have already lost 3,000 on 9/11 because of Bush incompetence and 1,500 soldiers because of his war on demand in Iraq. However it is not a loss that is exclusive to just us. I would like to think it applies to many Americans. Everyone of them that I have read (and I have read a lot). From the most conservative (Falwell) to the most liberal (Kangas), the bible is silent on the issue. If there was a direct verse against abortion then we wouldnt be arguing about this but since there isnt, both sides dig in the Bible looking for verses that might support their political agendas. I find it to be rather pathetic. If you need to pervert ancient scripture for the sake of their political ideology then it certainly shows a lack of conviction on their part. The constitution provides many rights that are implied. An officer reading you your rights before being arrested is an implied right. Using birth control is an implied right. Owning a firearm is an implied right from the second Maybe the Bible implies people can have abortions? It doesnt matterif something needs to be implied by multiple passages then it isnt direct. Which once again proves my point. Not a case of me forgetting but a case of me never suggesting anything of that nature on this thread. I have searched all over this thread for that phrase and used the forum search engine; nothing. My position doesnt need the Bible to prove a point. I find the Bible to be absolved of all moral teachings. You are confused. I am not the one pigeonholing the entire argument for supporting/condemning in Christianity by only using the Bible. I demanded for a direct passage against abortion and now even you admit this is impossible because it involves implying it from multiple sources. As for your question it is irrelevant but if you desperately need it answered to ease your mind it matters nothing to me if abortion is constitutional or notit matters more if it is moral. For many reasons. If you are writing off every person from being a Christian because they do not support your position then you need to condemn the majority of Christians as being false. This would mean Christianity is a minority at best and a dead religion at worst. Secondly, you appear to be totally ignorant of Christian history. If the Bible had a direct passage on abortion, as you admit, then the religion would have never practiced abortion for centuries. This isnt proof that abortion is right according to the Bible, but proof that it doesnt have sound message on the issue. Lastly, chattel slavery was supported in the Biblethe worst form of slavery; people being treated as property. The two do not connect. Murder is a relative term applied to illegal killing (remember, abortion is legal). The Old Testament does not view the fetus as a viable life form. The Bible treats unborn babies as extensions of the woman. If a pregnant woman was guilty of prostitution they were to be incineratednot spared (Genesis 38). The Bible shows God didnt spare fetal life from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorra and the drowning of the entire human race during Noahs Flood. God never prohibited the slaughter of pregnant women of the Mideanites, Amalekites and countless other tribes. Like always the fetus was viewed as a part of the woman. Her sin was tied to the fetus. There are even countries that legally treat fetuses as people and abortion is perfectly legal. You are forging a link and it is a link that doesnt prove anything. Seriously, where is this direct passage at? Exodus doesnt say anything about abortion. Instead Exodus 21mentions how a man must pay if he accidentally injures the husbands pregnant wife. It doesnt say anything about killing a fetus intentionally nor does it say a woman cannot have an abortion. Instead it sets a punishment that is exclusive to this situation and not any others. Also husbands were allowed to destroy the fetuses of their wives if she became pregnant due to adultery (Numbers 5). Families were given the right to kill their children if they became rude (Exodus 21). If you were an archeologist studying American laws hundreds of years from the future, youd probably claim we always banned abortion because our legal system punish people for accidentally damaging a fetuseven though abortion was perfectly legal since the beginning of our history. Once again, you are going back to forging links. Try again.","christian-cant-support-abortion","01:52 AM","abortion-debates","176"
"04-25-2005","4912",12,"Cone","None","No it isn't. I clearly said God is just in everything He does, not that men are just in everything they do. I have shown that for you to judge God is to in fact claim that you know more than God. This thread is arguing on Biblical grounds, that is, what the Bible says; and as such, it is again impossible to refute my claim. I guess by this statement you are defacing and trivializing the seriousness of a wanted pregnancy, seeing how you only think pregnancy is serious if it is unwanted.","Linus","111916","God is just in everything he does because it judges its actions as such. It has nothing to do with reason. Since when was knowing more then the other guy a prerequisite to judgment? God commits murder, therefore I condemn the murderer. Understood? I am not interested in the excuses of a murderer. Murder is murder. I am not arguing on Biblical grounds, I am arguing on moral grounds. This forum has left talking on just Biblical grounds a long time ago. Another logic fallacy. Are we catching red herrings in order to compensate for a lack of substance to the topic? Do you have an axe to grind with me? I must warn you that people who hold grudges discard logic and dignity to fulfill their emotionally charged impulses.
