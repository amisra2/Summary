Just watch what happens this Tuesday and in November to your vaunted, jack-legged, liberal heathens. You're going down the tubes, and there's nothing you can do about it.","Shooterandproud","401943","Sounds eerily familiar to ""Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever!"" -George Wallace Yes, we will yank it. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but we will, unless you keep your greasy paws out of politics. Tens of thousands of men didn't die for the freedoms outlined in the bill of rights so you could just throw them away when you feel you have a moral duty to do so.","christian-cant-support-abortion","12:47 PM","abortion-debates","301"

Show me where CONGRESS made the kind of law regarding an establishment of religion that you think is unconstitutional? If you can't cite it then dummy up. And what else did I just tell you?

I'm suggesting yanking the Church's special privilege of being tax-exempt. They'll still be free to say or do whatever they want, but they'll have to pay taxes like the rest of us. But if they want to be tax-exempt, they must be politically neutral. Back when I was a Christian, I started going to this very highly regarded, liberal, intelligent, Episcopal church. I can honestly say it was the first church I truly liked. There was no shooting abortion doctors, blowing up reproductive clinics, prop 8 campaigns, and any other hate that usually goes on in your typical Christian church. Even though I really liked the church, it was two towns over and I had stopped worshipping, so I stopped going. One year later, I open the newspaper to find the pastor (whom I really liked) was being threatened by the IRS for calling the Iraq war immoral. And yet almost every other Christian church I had gone to, the sermons were all about gays, feminists, evil liberals, abortion, etc. How come they weren't threatened? Moral of the story, I don't think its fair for any church to be politically campaigning. Its against the law.","christian-cant-support-abortion","03:16 PM","abortion-debates","305"

No special accomodations because they are a church would be ""mitts off"", would it not? That means no tax-exempt status.","christian-cant-support-abortion","07:05 PM","abortion-debates","307"
