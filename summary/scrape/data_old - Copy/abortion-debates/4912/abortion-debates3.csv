I hate to break it to the woman hating fundementalist crowd - not one of you gets to cliam what my faith is OR what I support. Period.","Voice Of Reason","111222","And I don't think anyone wants too, at least I don't........ I can't speak for anyone else but I am one person who loves women not hates them, but I just have a problem in murdering a baby in the womb who has committed no crime or hurt anyone when the mother's life is not endangered...","christian-cant-support-abortion","11:21 AM","abortion-debates","31"

If you don't believe in the Bible then how can you be a Christian? So with that in mind, God is against abortion. This is easily found by combining two things together in the Bible. The good book contains answers to hard questions, you just gotta read the thing. As for Linus, I got real tired of spelling things out for you. However, I suspect you don't support the Roe vs Wade case because abortion (the exact word) is no where in the constitution.","christian-cant-support-abortion","12:23 PM","abortion-debates","32"
"04-23-2005","4912",3,"Linus","None","Yep, the same sovereign creator who gave parents the right to slaughter their unruly children just POOF made everyone magically become unpregnant so it could ease the conscious of those who oppose abortion hundreds of years later and not find themselves feel conflicted over worshipping a supernatural abortionist. Or did god just kill millions of unborn babies because he knew hundreds of years later their would be Christian apologists who find ways to sugarcoat his brutalities? I suppose the later would take less effort in the end. But God never said he stopped people from giving birth or having babies so I assume he just went ahead and slaughtered them none the less. Wow, some divine being you worship. Killing tiny little unborn babies. What a tough guy! Sure showed them something about morality!","Cone","111236","Oh I don't sugar coat what he did. I just hold to sound Biblical doctrine that says God is just in everything he does.","christian-cant-support-abortion","12:30 PM","abortion-debates","33"

You, my mere mortal fellow sinner, do not have any authority whatsoever - to claim otherwise. Not to mention - following the word of God is a personal choice, there is nothing in the Bible to justify imposing adhearance on others.","christian-cant-support-abortion","12:53 PM","abortion-debates","34"

I have yet to ancounter anyone who advocates that we should all go out and get abortions. People who are pro-choice believe that it is not their business to make decisions for total strangers they do not know. What I mean by forcing adhearance is this; If I am Christian and and believe that Bible says that a certain activity is one I should not engage in - then it is up to me to not engage in it. It is not up to me to force others to follow that law. Actually the commandment is ""thou shalt not committ murder"" God actually advocated and demanded the killing of all kinds of people, even children, when the Hebrews took over the promised land.","christian-cant-support-abortion","03:04 PM","abortion-debates","40"
