I will be saved by the grace of our Lord, Jesus, and by that alone. I tell you the truth, anyone who claims to be a Christian and advocates the liberal idea that abortion is okay is deluding themselves.As Christians, it is our duty to try to bring the truth to anyone who is heading down the broad path to Hell. Abortion is a heinous crime against God and all of humanity. I have witnessed nothing but great guilt from women who have chosen to kill their babies. Abortion is wrong. Case closed.","jitobear","114868","I have never had an abortion. I have never claimed that the Bible supports abortion. I have said there is nothing in the Bible that supports YOU, mere mortal sinner man, demanding adhearance to it's teachings. I have said that I support a woman's right to choose. I have said I agree with reducing abortion through helping with the things that lead to unwanted pregnancy and that issues that cause a woman to choose abortion. I have said that demonizing of women as well as the trivialization of the issues they face, especially when pregnant, is abhorrent on many levels. I don't' believe it is Christian either, and when pro-life Christians bring out the Bible and continue to do this, their faith rings hollow to me. (Not that I am the one you have to impress.) Please, Hunter, show me the Bible passage that supports your cruelty or passing judgement - or the one that supports your forcing adhearance to your faith. I won't hold my breath. (Remember, I have read the entire Bible.)","christian-cant-support-abortion","10:59 AM","abortion-debates","256"

I know this is tough fo you to understand since you have the illusion that the whole of existance rests with you , what you experience and what you feel. This is not the religion thread - how one gets to Christ is not at issue. I am am taking issue with you - 1 - for telling people what they do, don't do, can and can not believe, think or feel. 2 - wanting to force abortion bans on people because your God says they can't them is forcing adhearance to the rules of your faith - duh.","christian-cant-support-abortion","02:41 PM","abortion-debates","260"

Neither your site nor VOR substance free posts proves that 99% of abortions are ""murder."" Besides, that is a subjective term. Applying a subjective term and then using it to declare a fact instantly invalides such a claim. It is merely a opinion. besides, what is ""extreme?"" My point still stands.
