YOU do not get to claim who is and is not part of Christ's flock. You are but a human. Not only that - you certainly hold your cronies in high regard if you really think God is interested in our petty politics. Shall I state the sins of your party and your ""couldn't find his own XXX with both hands"" numbskull of a president? There are 100,000 dead Iraqis on his watch. Or is that not such a big deal since they are already born? Or maybe because they are brown? Tell me what is so Christ like about a lack of humility or charity? You are no less sinful than anyone else. Get over yourself. Steve - to be a Christian one must believe.","christian-cant-support-abortion","02:02 PM","abortion-debates","92"
"04-24-2005","4912",7,"None","None","None","Steeeeve","111565","To be a Christian you must believe Jesus is the way to God and believe in God/Jesus. One can't believe in Jesus if he doesn't practice what he has done. So if you kill thousand of people and find nothing wrong with this but believe in Jesus and God you not only don't truely believe but you have broken Gods word without asking for forgivness. As for President Bush. I guess he does have dead people on his watch. So did President Truman. I would have to guess this is the hardest thing for a president to do. That is between him and God though.","christian-cant-support-abortion","02:17 PM","abortion-debates","93"
"04-24-2005","4912",7,"Ender Wiggin","None","The 10 commandments, properly translated from the original Hebrew and Greek, says thou shall not ""murder"" and their is a difference. Killing, such as in war or capital punishment, is justified and is NOT murder. God himself set up this standard. Think about it, he wrote 10 commandments, yet he sent the Hebrews to war, and set up a system of kinsmen redeemers, to punish murderers by death. Maybe you should take the time, to understand a situation FULLY, before you start accusing people of hypocrisy.","Duo_Maxwell","111577","Depends who you ask. So it is not murder for the state to have executed the 23 innocent people in the past? Or how about the 10,000 iraqi civilians we bombed? Besides, those aren't even the real ones. http://4forums.com/political/showthr...nts#post101928 Maybe you should take the time, to understand a situation FULLY before defending a idiot. You have obviously missed where VOR supports the murder of abortion doctors, pedophiliacs and other groups.","christian-cant-support-abortion","02:57 PM","abortion-debates","94"

I now know I cannot assume anything more then the basic knowledge of the audience. Most people were too lazy to use it.","Cone","111597","Duo, we have been over such claims in the past. You cannot assume that everyone in this particular thread knows anything about your past posts. You have come to this conclusion yourself in earlier thread. Let me refresh your memory: In a thread about partial birth abortion, you clearly did not state your position, but assumed that people knew everything about what you thought about the issue. When I showed you that this is a bad assumption, you came to the following conclusion: (interested parties can view the whole echange here ) Are the people on this thread supposed to believe VOR is a hypocrite, or that VOR supports the murder of abortion doctors, pedophiliacs and other groups, merely because you say so? I think not. Do you think that your assurance that you have posted such statements in the past will give your claim in this thread the necessary weight to prevail upon a third party? I think not. I do not think it a difficult thing to request you to back up your statement with two or three measly posts of VOR's that prove your point. If VOR has made so many of these statements, surely it isn't too difficult to enlighten all of us to these claims by posting a few of them, or posting a link to the post where you pointed all of these things out. Hogwash. You're too lazy to back up your claim.","christian-cant-support-abortion","03:49 PM","abortion-debates","97"

Not to mention a number of people specifically noted they didn't evne bother with the link, while I did get responses of a few people who actually took the effort into using the link validate my asseration. Your argument is entirely the fallacy of argument via laziness. It is not my fault that your party is too lazy to bother.","christian-cant-support-abortion","04:33 PM","abortion-debates","98"

Why is it that everything I said about you has been proven true? You're a coward when it comes to defending your positions. You haven't been in the military at all. Virtually every prophecy you say is false. You flip flop like Bush and Kerry. You don't know anything about liberalism or conservatism. You call everyone who disagrees with you a liberal. The list goes on and on. Not to mention you're a 13 year old from Florida. I actually keep doing it. It saves me the trouble from having to verbally jab you. In fact, I've conditioned you to jab yourself. So by all means, contiune.","christian-cant-support-abortion","04:42 PM","abortion-debates","100"

While you may not have been lazy there, you are clearly using the fallacy of argument via laziness here. I suggest you also learn how and what a fallacy is. I'm not moving from how I gave numerous times the link to his past and how you now refuse to use them. Changing the subject doesn't work if the other person isn't going to along with it. I suggest you abandon the futile effort as I understand how to get around the fallacy, if not just ignore it and keep hammering the intitial point.","christian-cant-support-abortion","04:58 PM","abortion-debates","102"
"04-24-2005","4912",7,"Cone","None","Hypocrite, flat out, hypocrite.","Duo_Maxwell","111646","call me names all you want. It's not my fault you are too inherently lazy to click on a link I provided many times. After all, I provided the means, I cannot force you to look. Is someone cranky that I called the fallacy before you could use it to gain a advantage? Don't worry, that happens alot. When a argument is primarily based upon a fraudulent means, the user often gets very irrated when the foundation is suddenly pulled out from them and the argument crumbles like a house of cards. Don't feel bad. Besides, keep defending VOR, it won't be my problem when you support someone who has no grasp of political ideologies, financial systems, or history in general. I must say though, it has been a while since I've seen a argument entirely based upon a single fallacy. But I suppose that is because of your lack of expierence with them. If one is going to base their argument on a fallacious method, they normally do so using a few, as to guard aganist what just occured to yours. One or two can be pulled out, but as a whole the argument is still alive.","christian-cant-support-abortion","05:07 PM","abortion-debates","104"

Because of this, I have clearly pointed out that you are a hypocrite. Not only that, but by your own words, you have called yourself one. Why should I listen to anything else that you say? I have not tried to defend anything, except possibly your reputation. I have asked you to provide evidence for your claim that VOR is a hypocrite so that you could avoid being called what you call him. But by your refusal to provide this ""so-called evidence,"" and that's all it is at this point, I have shown that you have effectively called yourself a hypocrite. This settles itslef if you just back your claim up. You cannot get around the fact that you, by your own words, have called yourself a hypocrite. How does that feel? Woops, I might have just committed the fallacy of telling the truth. Shame on me.","christian-cant-support-abortion","05:20 PM","abortion-debates","105"
