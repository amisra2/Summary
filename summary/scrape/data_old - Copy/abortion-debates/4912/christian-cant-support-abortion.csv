She mentioned that she has recently become a Christian and that HER god is one that supports a womens right to choice. Now there are so many problems with this that I don't even know where to start. Not only that, I am saying this as almost a ""newbie"" Christian as in I don't know everything there is to know about the Bible. However, I do know that the Christian God that is defined in the Bible is against abortion. Many argue that the Bible is not what the Christian God is because it has been translated into a meaningless document. How is this true when we have so many of the original scrolls? Moreever, how can one claim what God thinks if they don't have anything to base it on? For example if you say the Bible is worthless, you are a Christian, and God believes abortion is ok...then how did you come to this conclusion? The Christian God talks about how one is created before they were put in the womb. God also talks about not killing. So if you wish to be Christian and for abortion you need to rethink one of those stances. God doesn't conform to anyone.","christian-cant-support-abortion","12:19 AM","abortion-debates","1"

Do some research...fundamentalists from the far right would want you to believe without questioning that Christianity is solidly against abortion. However Christian theology and history have disproven this time and time again. In fact, Christianity's supposed stance against abortion is only very recent. For hundreds of years Christianity openly supported abortion before quickening. It is a dirty little secret that the ideological masters of the Christian-Con movement hope you never find out about because it would destroy them. The Bible falls completely silent on the issue of abortion. All direct condemnations on abortion found in the New Testament were quickly discarded as irrelevant by theologians. Christianity had it's chance at condemning abortion in the Bible and choose not to! For hundreds of years the Vatican supported abortion rights. Even it's most celebrated saints were not only outspoken supporters but blazed a path for theology to support it. And in early America, it wasn't rare for abortion services to be posted on Church bulletinboards. Again, these are facts that the pro-life/Christian-Con movement you never find out about.

"04-23-2005","4912",1,"God","None","The Bible tells us God is involved in our creation from the womb: ""Did not He who made me in the womb make him, And the same one fashion us in the womb? (Job 31:15) Yet Thou art He who didst bring me forth from the womb; Thou didst make me trust when upon my mother's breasts. Upon Thee I was cast from birth; Thou hast been my God from my mother's womb. (Psalms 22:9-10) For Thou didst form my inward parts; Thou didst weave me in my mother's womb. I will give thanks to Thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Wonderful are Thy works, And my soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from Thee, When I was made in secret, And skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth. Thine eyes have seen my unformed substance; And in Thy book they were all written, The days that were ordained for me, When as yet there was not one of them. (Psalms 139:13-16) Thus says the LORD who made you And formed you from the womb, who will help you, `Do not fear, O Jacob My servant; And you Jeshurun whom I have chosen. (Isaiah 44:2) Thus says the LORD, your Redeemer, and the one who formed you from the womb, ""I, the LORD, am the maker of all things, Stretching out the heavens by Myself, And spreading out the earth all alone, (Isaiah 44:24) If men fight, and hurt a woman with child, so that she gives birth prematurely, yet no harm follows, he shall surely be punished accordingly as the woman's husband imposes on him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. But if any harm follows, then you shall give life for life","Steeeeve","111140","lol Linus...You provide no proof for this. However the Bible does say ""I create you before I placed you in the womb""...this would imply that God created you before you are even conceived. Now He also talked about how you can't kill an innocent person. Maybe you should read up a little bit about what the Bible says on abortion. Christians are supposed to believe in the Bible as it is the Word of God.

God also says he made you out of dirt and then supernaturally lifting the dirt from the ground into the womans uterus. Oh well, I suppose it is all beliefs no matter how silly it sounds. I have read the Bible myselfnever found such a verse anywhere. Then again I suppose that depends on your definition of innocent, considering God sponsored the slaughter of non-Jews, disobedient children, people based upon their ethnic origin and etc.. And also person. The burden of proof would be for you to prove that God applies this to fetuses. It is impossible to read something that cant be found. You mean Exodus 21:22-23 and you are using a contemporary translation of itnot tradition. The traditional interpretation of this text, which even rabbinical scholars accepted for thousands of years, is this: if a man hurts a woman enough to cause a miscarriage, he reciprocates according to how much injury he caused her, i.e., an eye for an eye, etc. However, if the miscarriage resulted in no injury to the woman, then all the assailant had to pay was a monetary fine. The fact that the Bible does not equate the assailant's life with the stillborn's life is proof that the Bible does not count the fetus as a person. Further more we should have found replications of your contemporary translation since the copying of laws in the Middle East was widespread. Instead, the Assyrians, Hittites, Sumerians, Babylonians, Hammurapi and Eshnunna all have similar laws that go according to the traditional interpretation of it. Lastly, if a woman gave birth prematurely back in Biblical ages it would have resulted in the birth of a stillborn. Saving premature babies is an achievement of modern science. Not God. If it isnt so hard then why havent you found it yet? I am still waiting and you becoming cocky is not helping you.","christian-cant-support-abortion","01:45 AM","abortion-debates","14"

Your post-hoc conclusions arent working and so far this supposed verse that directly proves abortion is wrong in the Bible has not been brought up. Another post-hoc conclusion. Have any of you people taken a class in debating or logic? Conception would be the moment when sperm and egg are fused together. It does not mean created before he was in the womb. You need to re-read what I posted to. The original post just said God doesnt allow people to kill his own creations. I provided otherwise. That wouldnt be any of us here then. I have said the Bible says nothing directly about abortion and so far none of you can prove this. If you guys want to pick and choose whatever bible verse that might support your political beliefs be my guest. Youll get the same results but you still havent proven a direct one and you are just wasting my time. Where within my website did it say being a Christian means you need to believe the Bible says something about abortion? You see, all you are doing is amusing me with your simplistic tactics. Try something else. You arent gaining ground. The Bible says you cant kill a person? WRONG! The Bible is filled with countless stories of god sanctioned aggressive warmongering, genocide, pillaging, plundering, wanton destruction, sexual slavery, rape, misogyny, child abuse, homophobia, unfair laws, cruel and unusual punishment, the punishment of innocents, and brutal chattel slavery. God defines birth as following the commonly held Jewish belief that people are made from soil and lifted into the bellies of their mothers. Conception is a modern discovery, not biblical.

Apparently you believe rights cannot be implied through the constitutioneven though the Supreme Court disagrees with this. Nope, read again. I am stating the definition of rasach and proving abortion doesnt apply to any to it. Rasach is a relative term and if God didnt want it to be done as so then he would have used a more absolute term. I see you never took Bible History then and understand that Christian sects have different implications of the original ten commandments. You can even see this between the Catholic and Protestant denominations when it comes the ten commandments but this is a separate subject in itself. However I am going by the original word of god and reading the way the ten commandments were written at first. If you dont like it because it huts your argument then too bad. The ten commandments of today are very much dumbed down versions of the original. Kill was made to substitute murder and murder was made to substitute rasach in the 6th Commandment. Interpretations between Hebrew, Latin, Greek and then to other dialects often get mixed up and lose their true meaning as I just demonstrated. For example, even the word homosexual cannot be found within the Bible because there was never a Greek word for it in Biblical times. And no, much to your blind anti-religious tolerance.org bias, the source for this comes from Rabbi Balfour Brickner, National Director of the Commission on Interfaith Activities and author of Finding God in the Garden.

I never claimed that he did, I am saying that many people murder such as serial killers yet he doesn't punish them, he punished EVERYONE with the flood. Was EVERYONE worse than these serial killers? I don't think so. This quote is one of the reason I don't agree with Christianity. When you have a ruler that by definition is always just I don't like it. Too much authority. He could say that you have to eat your children and it would be considered just. Also someone earlier brought up finding anything you want to in the bible. Someone mentioned that the bible promoted homosexuality because it says ""love thy neighbor"" and maybe I want to go love my neighbor. They've used it to justify wars against innocent people (they weren't Christian, that was their only ""crime""), they've used it to execute ""witches"" and other stuff like that. Politicians use it to justify wars all the time (in fact Bush said that ""God told me to strike Al Quadea and I did, then he told me to strike Iraq, and I did""). You can twist and bend verses of the bible any way you want which is the problem. While you say that it states that fetuses are babies and murder is a sin but many also use the bible to claim that women should be inferior to men. They use it to justify their actions every which way and that's why the bible being so vague is a bad idea. If only they had written the word abortion or had an appendix at the end defining murder we'd know but unless there is a direct mention about abortion all you can take is an educated guess. People already admit that we can't comprehend God, how can we comprehend what he meant with 2 separate verses? Maybe he used different logic than us. With God you never know, that's why I like to stick with what I do know.","christian-cant-support-abortion","11:20 PM","abortion-debates","161"

However, if I find a link from you saying that name calling is bad then you would be guilty of the same thing right? You implied that VOR DOESN'T believe in ""voiding straight marriages that engage in anal""...however you have no provided no evidence to show his views on anal sex with regards to straight marriages. Therefore how can you call him a hypocrite? In your post you provided no evidence of what he said about polls. Thus your claim was unfounded which is what we are saying you do.

Yatsa is the word that is commonly misused to mean miscarriage while here is means to give birth. This is clear because later on the writter refers to a miscarriage using the word shakal. So in conclusion we can determine this quote to mean you can't kill the baby inside the mother. For a further explanation of this I have found a link that kinda says this Liberals are losing a lot these days. Every one of them? The constitution says nothing about abortion either. How are they implied rights? Maybe the Bible implies that you can't do abortion? In case you forgot you said ""abortion is not mentioned in the Bible therefore it is ok"" ...so I asked if you believed banning abortion is unconsitutional...you never really answered but if you said YES then you would be inconsistent in your views because the constitution never mentinos the word abortion at all...if you can't imply abortion in the Bible how can you in the constitution? I still don't see your point about Christians supporting abortion for hundreds of years...THey supported slavery too and this was against the Bible. I go by the Bible and it says you can't murder a person and also says a fetus is a person. Not only that, in Exodus it says if you kill the unborn you pay the price as if you murdered. So silent on abortion? No. Have you proven the Bible is silent? Not even close. Keep working at it.","Linus","111913","Because you use contemporary Hebrewnot classic, which is hundreds of years outdated like Old English. The grammar and definition have changed for many words in Hebrew since the reestablishment of Israel. Understandably, the community part would be dropped off so rashach would sound similar to the more accepted definition of murder. However splitting hairs isnt going to do you any good either. Your site is just using the regular old contemporary translation of Exodus 21 that I pointed out earlier. For thousands of years Rabbis translated it as this; if a woman is injured then it is an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life. If the fetus is injured then it is only a small crime that and those responsible must pay a fine according to the father. As such, even such a law was reflective in all other surrounding cultures. You dont have to go far into Judaism to see that Jewish culture didnt really cherish fetal life since an embryo is not reckoned a viable living thing (in Hebrew, bar kayama). Even the phrase adopted to unborn children is ubar yerech imo-- which deems the fetus as being part of the pregnant woman's body. If the webmaster to your site wants to play history revisionist because he thinks Exodus 21 should be interpreted differently from the way it has been done traditionally for many centuries then so be it. It doesnt change history or the original interpretation. And yet it still doesnt say anything against abortion. Try again. No, even if the Jews had translated it as such it would not condemn abortion. By your interpretation a man is being punished for wrongfully killing a fetus. This doesnt bar the parents from attaining an abortion. Once again you are using a logic fallacy. If situation Z provides punishment Y then situation X would provide punishment Y too. Your logic doesnt make any sense. Indeedwe have already lost 3,000 on 9/11 because of Bush incompetence and 1,500 soldiers because of his war on demand in Iraq. However it is not a loss that is exclusive to just us. I would like to think it applies to many Americans. Everyone of them that I have read (and I have read a lot). From the most conservative (Falwell) to the most liberal (Kangas), the bible is silent on the issue. If there was a direct verse against abortion then we wouldnt be arguing about this but since there isnt, both sides dig in the Bible looking for verses that might support their political agendas. I find it to be rather pathetic. If you need to pervert ancient scripture for the sake of their political ideology then it certainly shows a lack of conviction on their part. The constitution provides many rights that are implied. An officer reading you your rights before being arrested is an implied right. Using birth control is an implied right. Owning a firearm is an implied right from the second Maybe the Bible implies people can have abortions? It doesnt matterif something needs to be implied by multiple passages then it isnt direct. Which once again proves my point. Not a case of me forgetting but a case of me never suggesting anything of that nature on this thread. I have searched all over this thread for that phrase and used the forum search engine; nothing. My position doesnt need the Bible to prove a point. I find the Bible to be absolved of all moral teachings. You are confused. I am not the one pigeonholing the entire argument for supporting/condemning in Christianity by only using the Bible. I demanded for a direct passage against abortion and now even you admit this is impossible because it involves implying it from multiple sources. As for your question it is irrelevant but if you desperately need it answered to ease your mind it matters nothing to me if abortion is constitutional or notit matters more if it is moral. For many reasons. If you are writing off every person from being a Christian because they do not support your position then you need to condemn the majority of Christians as being false. This would mean Christianity is a minority at best and a dead religion at worst. Secondly, you appear to be totally ignorant of Christian history. If the Bible had a direct passage on abortion, as you admit, then the religion would have never practiced abortion for centuries. This isnt proof that abortion is right according to the Bible, but proof that it doesnt have sound message on the issue. Lastly, chattel slavery was supported in the Biblethe worst form of slavery; people being treated as property. The two do not connect. Murder is a relative term applied to illegal killing (remember, abortion is legal). The Old Testament does not view the fetus as a viable life form. The Bible treats unborn babies as extensions of the woman. If a pregnant woman was guilty of prostitution they were to be incineratednot spared (Genesis 38). The Bible shows God didnt spare fetal life from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorra and the drowning of the entire human race during Noahs Flood. God never prohibited the slaughter of pregnant women of the Mideanites, Amalekites and countless other tribes. Like always the fetus was viewed as a part of the woman. Her sin was tied to the fetus. There are even countries that legally treat fetuses as people and abortion is perfectly legal. You are forging a link and it is a link that doesnt prove anything. Seriously, where is this direct passage at? Exodus doesnt say anything about abortion. Instead Exodus 21mentions how a man must pay if he accidentally injures the husbands pregnant wife. It doesnt say anything about killing a fetus intentionally nor does it say a woman cannot have an abortion. Instead it sets a punishment that is exclusive to this situation and not any others. Also husbands were allowed to destroy the fetuses of their wives if she became pregnant due to adultery (Numbers 5). Families were given the right to kill their children if they became rude (Exodus 21). If you were an archeologist studying American laws hundreds of years from the future, youd probably claim we always banned abortion because our legal system punish people for accidentally damaging a fetuseven though abortion was perfectly legal since the beginning of our history.

With God you never know, that's why I like to stick with what I do know.","chloe","112015","While the Bible claims God is just and true in all his ways (and backs it up with evidence), it also makes multitudes of claims about other aspects of his nature (and then backs it up with evidence). Psalms 145 8 The LORD is gracious and merciful; Slow to anger and great in lovingkindness. 9 The LORD is good to all, And His mercies are over all His works. Ex 33 18 Then Moses said, ""I pray You, show me Your glory!"" 19 And He said, "" I Myself will make all My goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of the LORD before you; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show compassion on whom I will show compassion."" And then Ex 34 34:6-7 Then the LORD passed by in front of him and proclaimed, ""The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in lovingkindness and truth; who keeps lovingkindness for thousands, who forgives iniquity, transgression and sin; yet He will by no means leave {the guilty} unpunished, visiting the iniquity of fathers on the children and on the grandchildren to the third and fourth generations."" None of these attributes ever conflict with justice. The Bible makes the claim of clarity. But you have assumed that just because anyone can twist and bend it, take it out of context, do whatever to make it say what they want, then it is not clear (which happens to be a wrong assumption). It is true that anyone could distort and misrepresent any clearly written document in the same way that they can take the letters of the alphabet and make it say whatever they want. This is why it is imoportant to read the document in question in context before buying into any claim made of the document. While God cannot be fully known he can be known and can be rightly known and the Bible can be rightly known and understood.

However Ill give you the benefit of the doubt and believe you were merely confused and have thus retreated from your post and have acknowledged my superiority over you in this thread. A very honorable thing you do. Like I said. It isnt going to matter whether we use an ancient or contemporary definition of Hebrew. You still cant prove your point either way because murder applies to only illegal killing. I am sure you have. So? You are too busy arguing over moot detail. Time to do a little research on ancient abortion history, shall we? Hebrew laws were often copied by surrounding cultures and vice versa. The earliest laws that provided punishment for killing fetuses seemed to have been made in the interest of the fathers and not the fetuses themselves. The Code of Hammurabi, which was thought to have been written in the Eighteenth Century B.C.E., required that silver be paid to the father of a pregnant woman who was caused to miscarry by another person (Platt). The Hebrew Torah or Old Testament likewise requires simply a payment to the master of the woman who was caused to miscarry (Exodus 21:22-25). A Middle Assyrian law that was in force around five centuries after Hammurabis code provides the most striking example of a law protecting fetuses in the interest of the father. It punished a woman who purposely caused herself to miscarry with impalement and no burial, but fathers had the right to practice infanticide on their unwanted offspring (Lerner; Reiman). http://www.geocities.com/dnwppg/rese.../prologic.html I see you are wrong once again. I know your rhetoric like the back of my hand and if you want to squabble over petty detail about Hebrew words then have fun. My position is not only solid but Exodus 21 cannot be used to imply abortion is wrong. But it doesnt. It doesnt say a fetus is a person. It doesnt say that the perpetrator has committed such a crime (murder) to begin with. Once again, you are forging links which are not there. Judaism, as I stated over and over again, acknowledges life at first breath. The Bible gives permission to destroy fetal life in many occasions. If killing a fetus was murder then you need to find a passage that absolutely condemns killing a fetus. The Hebrews could kill the unborn babies of the enemy and a husband could abort a fetus if it was the byproduct of an affair. Sorry, the Bible isnt a one way street on the issue of preserving fetal life. ""Try again"" as I always say. You are the one who made the claimI am only agreeing with you and explaining my answer. Is that a now crime? So you now admit there isnt a direct passage on abortion. How long did it take you to figure that out? Anyone can imply that the Bible supports X position. You could even use it to support infanticide, genocide or slavery. It has been done before. Never said that I thought this. Wonderfully. As we speak, you guys elected a president who campaigns for pro-choice candidates. Hmm GOP morality doesnt exactly win you electionsit really just frightens people. Remember the Republican convention in 1996? Jerry Falwell or Robertson declaring a war on the godless? Or how about Bush in 2000 constantly having to address the fear in moderate voters about him possibly outlawing abortion?

First, I dont dispense the will to doubt unless there is something to give doubt in the first place. Do you have a problem with that? VOR hasnt expressed any disagreement by this so why do you care? VOR has sat by and took it without correcting me at all. Second, where is your outrage against VOR for not giving women the benefit of the doubt? VOR collectively calls the majority of women have abortions out of comfort but I dont see you consoling him to give them the benefit of the doubt. So I guess your outrage is only selective. Unless you are VOR or should I give you the benefit of the doubt and suggest that you are posting under two different screen names? I wouldnt want to trample upon your toes anymore then I have.

No, his statement did not but his statements as a collective have. I simply stated my opinion that he doesnt take pregnancy, esp. if unwanted, as serious. VOR has been slandering abortion as a reason done mostly out of convenience. The nature that anyone can whittle down such a situation as merely being an issue of comfort shows not only a lack of insight about how stressful pregnancy is but also apathetic to their plight. If VOR wants to believe women have abortions because they had a bad day or their head hurts and if so I would label him as that; someone who doesnt take unwanted pregnancies serious. You know, it really speaks volumes when you make a post that is entirely irrelevant to the topic and to you, but also apparently condone such a statement as VORs over nailing someone for not giving someone the benefit of the doubt.

Whoaso does that mean if someone said the sky is blue on geocities it wouldnt be a fact then? If you ever dared to read the site that I provided the author credits their information. On the other hand your BibleStudy.org doesnt provide any citations of information. But then again, I am sure you have never read it. Too busy attacking the web service provider then the info. My teachers never allowed me to use information from the internet unless it came from a .gov. Unlike government websites, which can be held liable for the information they use, anyone can say what they want on the internet. Whether it be geocities or some .org. Even your precious bible study website shows no proof of the author having a Phd. So there is a difference between calling Jane Fonda a joke for what she believes (God supporting abortion) and calling you a joke for what you believe (God condemns abortion)? Your hypocrisy is astounding and the fact that you dont dismiss this probably means you agree with my assessment. The double standards you present are tearing your argument to pieces. You posted this ten pages down and I have defeated it again, again and again. It is like beating a dead horse. Lets go over the motions once again. I. Your interpretation of Exodus 21 NEVER states killing a fetus is murder. In fact, it wouldnt be murder at all; it is manslaughter. The man who harms the woman did it by accident while murder would require him to premeditatedly attack the woman. However you use commandment 6 in conjunction with Exodus 21 to make your point but commandment 6 only condemns murdernot manslaughter. So commandment 6 + Exodus 21 do not equal abortion is wrong. Try again. II. Give Exodus 21 the benefit of the doubt. There are many countries that punish people for harming pregnant women and allow legal abortion. III. The Bible doesnt absolutely condemn killing fetuses. In Numbers 5 and Exodus 21, people are given the right to destroy innocent fetal life. Hebrews could slay unborn babies of the enemy, husbands could make their wives miscarry if his wife became pregnant due to adultery and etc.. IV. Biblical laws were often emulated and vice versa to similar neighboring cultures. Their laws interpreted the same way Rabbis have been interpreting Exodus 21 for hundreds of years. The Code of Hammurabi and the Sumerian code fined the man who induced a miscarriage upon the husbands wife (in the Sumerian case, it was based on the womans social status.) In Assyrian Code, a man charged with the crime only had to do public service. Again and again, accidentally inducing abortion was only a misdemeanor. Not murder nor manslaughter. And I posted this as irrelevant and goes to a more thornier question; if god knew us before the moment of conception then why would he supposedly ensoul a zygote that would have been knowingly aborted? I dont need to refute; it isnt going to make my position anymore right then it already is. I have already over-killed your argument. If you want to squabble over Hebrew words be my guestnot going to spend hours at a library finding the definitions of such words in a classical Hebrew dictionary. ( www.pollingreport.com/abortion posted 1,525,829 times now) 60% of Americans support Roe v Wade. Attitudes about abortion have changed relatively little in the 30 years since the Roe v.

I honestly think we do need to help out more..and not just with women but eveyone. And there are some groups out there that help pregnant women without ever recommending abortion. I am not sure how you fix unwanted pregnancy caused by two people having sex and realizing they just didn't want the pregnancy. You would have to do a major culture shift involving many things. However, having abortion, in my opinion, probably won't help people stop having sex but would encourage it. If there is a way out people will do it. I suspect that if abortion was banned and the next 5yrs or so many teens get pregnant then we would see a drop because people would get a bit smarter. So culture shift if the only way to get rid of that portion of abortions. The rape, incest, and probably the poor problem could be solved with some community support groups. Have people be less selfish (another culture shift). However, having abortion here wouldn't help people become less selfish because abortion in itself is selfish (atleast on someones part, not always the mother). So those are my views on it. I don't see people starting to help women until abortion is gone. One other side-not thing. The people that are more inclined to help are the ones that don't support abortion. This is obviously not a fact but is an opinion that I have observed. Church groups come to mind when I think of this.","christian-cant-support-abortion","02:41 PM","abortion-debates","240"

Depends. 9 months ago if you put $50,000 into a 30 month CD, you could have bagged $2,000 in real income. Now, that all assumes inflation isn't going anywhere. But inflation when it has nowhere to go but up causes some real problems. Sure, if inflation went to 6% and you were getting 4%, your buying power actually decreases by 2%. That $50,000 could have been invested in a higher interest, or could be removed to fund such a investment. Can't do that with a CD, you're stuck (unless you want to break the contract and get whacked with a high cancellation fee on top of the inflation difference). It's utterly stupid. When inflation is this low, it has nowhere to go but up. I will personally gaurnetee thats inflation will rise. Getting stuck into a low interest rate long term contract when that is going to happen is sheer idiocy. I disagree. During the 80s inflation hit 18%. Some CDs were offering mid 20%, and you can take a CD out for YEARS. Imagine investing $50,000 with 25% interest rate. Now imagine you signed the contract for 5 years. The rates fell very quickly. In the 90s inflation never broke 6%. You were litterally getting 19% return. Sick. That's $12,500 a year in nominal, but $9,500 in real money at 6% inflation. Now that's a long term investment that uses high interest rates which were based off of high inflation to profit when inflation has nowhere to go but down. This is why I think VOR has virtually no grasp of finance. http://4forums.com/political/showpos...6&postcount=40 He describes a CD as a good investment when the rates are low. If the rates are low, inflation is low. Therefore, he thinks a CD is a good investment when inflation is low.

Also, while ""HER"" God might be one of choice, the TRUE CHRISTIAN GOD is not. He has often told us to not kill, as it is even one of the Ten Holy Commandments. So, what makes us think that we have the right to take a baby's life? And don't confuse yourself. It might be a bunch of cells, but the cells evolve into something more. Therefor, it is considered a baby. If it's not, than why do you say that you are pregnant, when you find out that you are positive? To be pregnant means that you are with child, and your justification for getting an abortion is that it's not technically a child yet. SO does that mean that you are simply with cells? My question is not how can someone claim to know what God thinks when they have nothing to base it upon, but it is ""How can one, especially one that claims to be a Christian, claim to know what God thinks in the first place?"" We, as Christians, know that you can not tell God what to do, nor can you tell him what not to do. So, if you can't do those two things, how do you manage to know what he is thinking?

Come on, people. You don't butcher an innocent baby for the conveience or sins of the parents. There's plenty of people in the world who would have adopted that baby. And if no one else would have, I would have. Let's see your best one (1) example. In the meantime, you can revel in this: What does the Bible say about abortion? And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she has a miscarriage, yet there is no further injury, he shall surely be fined as the womans husband may demand of him; and he shall pay as the judges decide. But if there is further injury, then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life. (Exodus 21:22-23) Straight from the Jewish Torah, God immediately affirms the value of human life in a mothers womb. Next, a divinely appointed prophet from the womb : Jeremiah 1:5 Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations. Psalm 139:13 For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mothers womb. Of course, the question here is: What divine insight does the pro-abortion crowd think they have to where they can destroy in a mothers womb that which God is somehow instrumental in creating? That was a future prophet to the nations in the womb. But the pro-infanticide crowd wants to pretend that instead of a baby with a divine plan, its nothing more than an unviable tissue mass. Well, God is not fooled , and neither are we. Finally, every time you see another child playing and laughing, every time you see a boy or girl graduate, get married, have their own child, and so on, I hope you see that innocent little baby you had ripped from your body.

Lot's of people have back problems and it's attributed to the poor design of the back which is obviously better suited for use horizontally. Lot's of people have died from choking, wouldn't a smart designer have separated the air intake hole from the food intake hole so that does not happen? Imagine that i ask you to design the 2012 Corvette, but I then say you must start with a Model T and add things to the outside to make the new car.

Nontracts - FFRF Publications Nontract #7 Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc. Absolutely nothing! The word ""abortion"" does not appear in any translation of the bible! Out of more than 600 laws of Moses, none comments on abortion. One Mosaic law about miscarriage specifically contradicts the claim that the bible is antiabortion, clearly stating that miscarriage does not involve the death of a human being. If a woman has a miscarriage as the result of a fight, the man who caused it should be fined. If the woman dies, however, the culprit must be killed: ""If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. ""And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, Eye for eye, tooth for tooth . . ."" Ex. 21:22-25 The bible orders the death penalty for murder of a human being, but not for the expulsion of a fetus. When Does Life Begin? According to the bible, life begins at birth--when a baby draws its first breath. The bible defines life as ""breath"" in several significant passages, including the story of Adam's creation in Genesis 2:7, when God ""breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."" Jewish law traditionally considers that personhood begins at birth. Desperate for a biblical basis for their beliefs, some antiabortionists cite obscure passages, usually metaphors or poetic phrasing, such as: ""Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me."" Psalm 51:5 This is sexist, but does nothing other than to invoke original sin. It says nothing about abortion. The Commandments, Moses, Jesus and Paul ignored every chance to condemn abortion. If abortion was an important concern, why didn't the bible say so? Thou Shalt Not Kill? Many antiabortionists quote the sixth commandment, ""Thou shalt not kill"" (Ex. 20:13) as evidence that the bible is antiabortion. They fail to investigate the bible's definition of life (breath) or its deafening silence on abortion. Moreover, the Mosaic law in Exodus 21:22-25, directly following the Ten Commandments, makes it clear that an embryo or fetus is not a human being. An honest reader must admit that the bible contradicts itself. ""Thou shalt not kill"" did not apply to many living, breathing human beings, including children, who are routinely massacred in the bible. The Mosaic law orders ""Thou shalt kill"" people for committing such ""crimes"" as cursing one's father or mother (Ex. 21:17), for being a ""stubborn son"" (Deut. 21:18-21), for being a homosexual (Lev. 20:13), or even for picking up sticks on the Sabbath (Numbers 15:32-35)! Far from protecting the sanctity of life, the bible promotes capital punishment for conduct which no civilized person or nation would regard as criminal. Mass killings were routinely ordered, committed or approved by the God of the bible. One typical example is Numbers 25:4-9, when the Lord casually orders Moses to massacre 24,000 Israelites: ""Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the Lord against the sun."" Clearly, the bible is not pro-life! Most scholars and translators agree that the injunction against killing forbade only the murder of (already born) Hebrews. It was open season on everyone else, including children, pregnant women and newborn babies. Does God Kill Babies? ""Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones."" Psalm 137:9 The bible is not pro-child. Why did God set a bear upon 42 children just for teasing a prophet (2 Kings 2:23-24)? Far from demonstrating a ""pro-life"" attitude, the bible decimates innocent babies and pregnant women in passage after gory passage, starting with the flood and the wanton destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, progressing to the murder of the firstborn child of every household in Egypt (Ex. 12:29), and the New Testament threats of annihilation. Space permits only a small sampling of biblical commandments or threats to kill children: Numbers 31:17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones. Deuteronomy 2:34 utterly destroyed the men and the women and the little ones. Deuteronomy 28:53 And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters. I Samuel 15:3 slay both man and woman, infant and suckling. 2 Kings 8:12 dash their children, and rip up their women with child. 2 Kings 15:16 all the women therein that were with child he ripped up. Isaiah 13:16 Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled and their wives ravished. Isaiah 13:18 They shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eyes shall not spare children. Lamentations 2:20 Shall the women eat their fruit, and children. Ezekiel 9:6 Slay utterly old and young, both maids and little children. Hosea 9:14 give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. Hosea 13:16 their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up. Then there are the dire warnings of Jesus in the New Testament: ""For, behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the womb that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck."" Luke 23:29 The teachings and contradictions of the bible show that antiabortionists do not have a ""scriptural base"" for their claim that their deity is ""pro-life."" Spontaneous abortions occur far more often than medical abortions. Gynecology textbooks conservatively cite a 15% miscarriage rate, with one medical study finding a spontaneous abortion rate of almost 90% in very early pregnancy. That would make a deity in charge of nature the greatest abortionist in history! Are Bible Teachings Kind to Women? The bible is neither antiabortion nor pro-life, but does provide a biblical basis for the real motivation behind the antiabortion religious crusade: hatred of women. The bible is anti-woman, blaming women for sin, demanding subservience, mandating a slave/master relationship to men, and demonstrating contempt and lack of compassion: ""I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee."" Genesis 3:16 What self-respecting woman today would submit willingly to such tyranny? The antiabortion position does not demonstrate love for humanity, or compassion for real human beings. Worldwatch Institute statistics show that 50% of abortions worldwide are illegal, and that at least 200,000 women die every year--and thousands more are hurt and maimed--from illegal or self-induced abortions. Unwanted pregnancies and complications from multiple pregnancies are a leading killer of women. Why do antiabortionists want North American women to join these ghastly mortality statistics? Every day around the world more than 40,000 people, mostly children, die from starvation or malnutrition. We must protect and cherish the right to life of the already-born. Do Churches Support Abortion Rights? Numerous Christian denominations and religious groups agree that the bible does not condemn abortion and that abortion should continue to be legal. These include: American Baptist Churches-USA American Ethical Union American Friends (Quaker) Service Committee American Jewish Congress Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) Episcopal Church Lutheran Women's Caucus Moravian Church in America-Northern Province Presbyterian Church (USA) Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints Union of American Hebrew Congregations Unitarian Universalist Association United Church of Christ United Methodist Church United Synagogue of America Women's Caucus Church of the Brethren YWCA Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice Catholics for Free Choice Evangelicals for Choice Belief that ""a human being exists at conception"" is a matter of faith, not fact. Legislating antiabortion faith would be as immoral and unAmerican as passing a law that all citizens must attend Catholic mass! The bible does not condemn abortion; but even if it did, we live under a secular constitution, not in a theocracy. The separation of church and state, the right to privacy, and women's rights all demand freedom of choice.

Of course, the question is, what divine insight does the pro-abortion crowd think they have to where they can destroy in a mother's womb that which God is somehow instrumental in creating? Quotes on abortion, from Mother Teresa: "" But I feel that the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion, because it is a war against the child - a direct killing of the innocent child - murder by the mother herself. And if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another?"" ""By abortion, the mother does not learn to love, but kills even her own child to solve her problems. And by abortion, the father is told that he does not have to take any responsibility at all for the child he has brought into the world. That father is likely to put other women into the same trouble. So abortion just leads to more abortion. Any country that accepts abortion is not teaching the people to love, but to use any violence to get what they want. That is why the greatest destroyer of love and peace is abortion.

I think its very hard to know what that means, when life begins. Is it when a cell separates? Is it when the soul stirs? So I dont presume to know the answer to that question. (Source: 2008 Democratic Compassion Forum at Messiah College Apr 13, 2008) And in a classic display of Biblical ignorance, Obama said the following during an interview with Pastor Rick Warren at the Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California: whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective, answering that question with specificity, you know, is above my pay grade . Have you never read Psalm 139:13 or Jeremiah 1:5, Mr. President? You're supposed to be a Christian and you don't even know your own Bible. And that after 20 years of sitting in the pew in church. Astonishing! In another egregious exhibition of contempt for the sanctity of life, President Obama remarked: Look, I got two daughters 9 years old and 6 years old, he said. I am going to teach them first about values and morals, but if they make a mistake, I dont want them punished with a baby. I dont want them punished with an STD at age 16, so it doesnt make sense to not give them information. Barack Obama So, not only does Obama consider a precious, unborn baby in the womb as punishment for its mother, but he callously places the baby in the same general category as an STD both punishments. The gist of his remarks makes it quite obvious that its better in Obamas mind to exterminate the innocent baby instead. Its been said before and Ill say it again: You dont kill an innocent unborn baby for the sins or inconvenience of its parents. If they dont want the baby give it up for adoption.
