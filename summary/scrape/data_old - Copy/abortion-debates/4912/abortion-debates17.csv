Oh yes, you think that a CD is a good idea during a period of low inflation Abortion clincs rarely are dedicated abortion clincs: meaning they do other things besides abortion. A number are heavily funded through voluntary donations. Not to mention in some states and countries abortion clincs are mandated to provide free services. Besides, in a free market, how can you call yourself a conservative yet want to restrict business? I smell a hypocrite.","christian-cant-support-abortion","07:09 PM","abortion-debates","242"

Low inflation would probably mean lower interest rates and thus a CD would most likely be a good idea. I would say that you shouldn't base investments on inflation rate though. well, using the messed up definition of conservative used today this wouldn't be hypocritical. You think you would have learned to stop calling/suggesting people are hypocrites after the 3 pages of showing you that you had no proof. Do you wish to revisit this again?","christian-cant-support-abortion","08:19 PM","abortion-debates","243"

If the inflation rate is low, and your investing for a long period, that means inflation has only one place to go: up. CD rates are almost always fixed, and they aren't significently higher then the inflation rate when you deposit it. Therefore, inflation rates are going to go up, while your CD rate, pitiful as it already is, is not. You actually LOSE money. It's stupid. Incredibly stupid. A CD is good idea when inflation is high, it has no where to go but down, further increasing the buying power you recieve from the CD. Messed up? or the wrongly used term? A conservative is for free markets. I simply said I ""smell"" a hypocrite. But I suppose considering how VOR doesn't even have a basic grasp as to what conservative IS, I suppose that he isn't a hypocrite for calling himself a conservative and then defining it how he sees it. I guess he's just a idiot then.","christian-cant-support-abortion","08:49 PM","abortion-debates","244"

I mean, whether or not you have high inflation or low inflation you are still making nothing with a CD. You would also have to be good at determining future inflation rates...if they are to remain fairly constant then as said low/high inflation doesn't matter. To be honest, I wouldn't put money in a CD because you never make anything and you probably make less then some government investments that have no tax. So assuming VOR said that, I think he is probably wrong in most cases although his situation could be possible.","christian-cant-support-abortion","11:24 PM","abortion-debates","246"

Not to mention - following the word of God is a personal choice, there is nothing in the Bible to justify imposing adhearance on others.","Hunter","114727","Jitobear, you are completely deluding yourself.

I will be saved by the grace of our Lord, Jesus, and by that alone. I tell you the truth, anyone who claims to be a Christian and advocates the liberal idea that abortion is okay is deluding themselves.As Christians, it is our duty to try to bring the truth to anyone who is heading down the broad path to Hell. Abortion is a heinous crime against God and all of humanity. I have witnessed nothing but great guilt from women who have chosen to kill their babies. Abortion is wrong.

Depends. 9 months ago if you put $50,000 into a 30 month CD, you could have bagged $2,000 in real income. Now, that all assumes inflation isn't going anywhere. But inflation when it has nowhere to go but up causes some real problems. Sure, if inflation went to 6% and you were getting 4%, your buying power actually decreases by 2%. That $50,000 could have been invested in a higher interest, or could be removed to fund such a investment. Can't do that with a CD, you're stuck (unless you want to break the contract and get whacked with a high cancellation fee on top of the inflation difference). It's utterly stupid. When inflation is this low, it has nowhere to go but up. I will personally gaurnetee thats inflation will rise. Getting stuck into a low interest rate long term contract when that is going to happen is sheer idiocy. I disagree. During the 80s inflation hit 18%. Some CDs were offering mid 20%, and you can take a CD out for YEARS. Imagine investing $50,000 with 25% interest rate. Now imagine you signed the contract for 5 years. The rates fell very quickly. In the 90s inflation never broke 6%. You were litterally getting 19% return. Sick. That's $12,500 a year in nominal, but $9,500 in real money at 6% inflation. Now that's a long term investment that uses high interest rates which were based off of high inflation to profit when inflation has nowhere to go but down. This is why I think VOR has virtually no grasp of finance. http://4forums.com/political/showpos...6&postcount=40 He describes a CD as a good investment when the rates are low. If the rates are low, inflation is low. Therefore, he thinks a CD is a good investment when inflation is low. VOR , merely because you do not have the intelligence to understand basic finance doesn't make my arguments worthless.","christian-cant-support-abortion","03:12 AM","abortion-debates","254"

It just shows that when one trys to assert himself on an issue for the common good there will always be someone who will resort to cut throught politics and as a result will in the same pointless bickering that has ensued our government. Sir I beseech you to rethink you comments so that together we may work toward the common good not only in this nation. But in this world. If you still need proof I am sincere in my comments I refer you to one of the other threads in the civil rights forum. I made some solid comments on Blair's speech on saving Africa from the hellishness the envelops their homeland. I pray that his vision will become a reality.","christian-cant-support-abortion","03:23 AM","abortion-debates","255"
