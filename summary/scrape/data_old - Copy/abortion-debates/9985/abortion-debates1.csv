Your article doesn't even talk about abortion.

See this study, for instance: http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/PUB...heet/fsest.htm People have small families because they want small families. In point of fact, the abortion rate in Europe is generally much lower than the rate in the US, due, again, to education and contraception.

But it is a worthy thread because of the reality that Islam ""is"" closing in on what we consider ""the free world"". If you love your freedom and the choices you now have, you should pay attention to Islam. They are consumed with a hatred for the west and are dedicated to their cause.
