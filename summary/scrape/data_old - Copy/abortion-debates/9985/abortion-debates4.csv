THEY care about life more than the ""free"" world.... I believe that one of the reasons we are dealing with terrorism in the world is because we are committing mass murder on babies in the womb... Need i say more...","eanassir","294371","Why should they kill a human being in the womb, whether this human being is Arab or not? Aren't the Arab and non-Arab created by God?

VT is arguing that the low birth rate in the West is attributable to high abortion rates and the high birth rates amongst Arabs creates a numbers game in favor of the Arabs. Since they respect life (their own, that is) more than the West, their numbers are growing much quicker, while our lack of respect for human life is causing the gap to widen.","abortion-reason-europe-turning-arab","06:10 PM","abortion-debates","51"

It is callous to use their children to win the 'numbers game' quality before quantity. I don't deny that abortion is murder in the womb though.","abortion-reason-europe-turning-arab","02:40 AM","abortion-debates","53"
"12-20-2007","9985",4,"jitobear","294466","Hmm - the stats say Western Europe has the lowest incidence of abortion. http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_IAW.html The Guttmacher Report on Public Policy December 2001, Volume 4, Number 6 Special Analysis Islam, Women and Family Planning: A Primer ..... The Koran does not explicitly address abortion, but there is general agreement in Islam that abortion is only permitted for the most serious reasons, such as saving a woman's life. And even then, it is only allowed before ""life is breathed"" into the fetus, variously regarded as within the first 40, 80 or 120 days. A minority of scholars oppose abortion at any stage of development, based on the belief that the embryo is already on its way to having a soul from the moment of conception.","JPSartre12","294559","Your stats aren't broken down into meaningful groups, so nothing is learned WRT Muslims.","abortion-reason-europe-turning-arab","02:00 PM","abortion-debates","54"

Hint: Eastern Europe IS part of Europe and it has an abortion rate of 105/100 births. When you evaluate the # of abortions and # of pregnancies, it's easy to see how Europeans could become the minority in their own continent.","abortion-reason-europe-turning-arab","03:47 PM","abortion-debates","56"
"12-20-2007","9985",4,"None","None","None","thelmoose","294609","It really doesn't matter how many abortions are occurring or the ratio to live births or the birth rate per woman. Unless one knows the denominator, the ratios are meaningless. All you need to is how many absolute live births are occurring in one group versus another (and I suppose you also need to consider the infant mortality rate alongside those numbers.) The decision to terminate a pregnancy has the same effect as birth control or abstinence. If one woman has 10 children and 10 abortions, she will end up with more children and a woman who has 2 children and no abortions. I am making no comment on anything but the math. All I am saying is the orginal article does not give enough information to conclude what the title of the thread states. The original article wasn't even discussing Arabs or Muslims, it was talking about immigrants. As previously stated, worst thread ever.","abortion-reason-europe-turning-arab","06:44 PM","abortion-debates","57"

There are 105 abortions for every 100 live births. That means that for every 100 babies brought by the stork an ADDITIONAL 105 were dropped.","abortion-reason-europe-turning-arab","10:13 PM","abortion-debates","59"

Yes - it is true that the rates are high in Eastern Europe, but recent also show that Eastern Europe has had the greatest decrease in abortions int the world in recent years - I think that is good.
