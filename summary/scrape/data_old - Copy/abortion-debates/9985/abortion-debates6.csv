Did you actually mean that? If you did, that is not Pro-choice but Pro-abortion. Women did not have a choice in whether their pregnancies were terminated or not which, having it, is the definition of the PC point of view. So no, they were NOT Pro-choice.","abortion-reason-europe-turning-arab","11:16 PM","abortion-debates","77"
