Something freakishly inane and strange. A non-being if you will. You were a parasite that was most likely willing placed into your host. Then that host decided to keep you for who knows what reason and either raise you or give you to another to be raised.","Shooterandproud","324326","""I"" didn't start to exist until the third trimester.

I doubt that all pain amounts to ""great bodily harm."" In that respect, it is very circumstantial. If someone breaks into your house and wants to punch you in the fact, but the victim does not perceive that the attacker is or is about to inflict deadly force upon him, then the victim may only repel the attack with the force that is reasonable to repel the attack.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","11:33 PM","abortion-debates","242"

Our ""Make my day"" law unfortunately permits a property owner or renter to shoot to kill through a closed door if that occupant believes that her/his premises is about to be invaded. Louisiana and Texas have the same law. Now, why not tell the forum why you believe the government is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is. I suspect is has something to do with your not wanting to look foolish on a second topic.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","07:25 AM","abortion-debates","243"

Tell us, sweetie, just exactly why you believe that the government is better able to determine the futire of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is. It seems as though all the profetallifers and you are afraid to answer that question. If I were a profetallifer, I would run like a thief from it as well, because to answer is to reveal the intellectual bankruptcy of the POV.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","07:03 PM","abortion-debates","249"

The natural course of any pregnancy is 40 weeks of gestation then live birth. That is the NORMAL, NATURAL course. A woman wanting to end that pregnancy at any point of the gestational period is going against the normal course of nature. The government, in such cases, in the interest of the continuation of the human species, should be able to assist these pregnancies through to live births and make adoptions easier, NOT enable murder.","Shooterandproud","324422","Ok, so if we are going to let everything take the ""normal course of nature"", then lets just let everyone die. Have cancer? Too bad, its the natural course of nature that you die. What about heart failure? Sorry, no paddles of life for you. We're going to let nature take its course. Just like your beloved pope, nature is not always right.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","08:42 PM","abortion-debates","251"

Second of all, each of the medical conditions you cite are incidences of medical intervention designed to PROLONG LIFE.

It is in those minority of cases where the mother's life is in danger I support abortion, or where the woman's ability to control becoming pregnant was violated and eliminated due to rape.
