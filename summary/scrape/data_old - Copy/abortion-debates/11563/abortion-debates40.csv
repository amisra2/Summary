First of all it is only that one persons opinion that aging begins at that time. Second of all aging has NOTHING to do with the womans RIGHTS who may be carrying that glob of cells. All you posted was a red herring .

"03-01-2009","11563",40,"Chuz Life","345495","I'm sure you can find even more of these yourself, if you need them. I believe a person's rights should begin when their life does, D. Ingus. Don't you?","Colonel Ingus","345497","I am not a lemming, so I don't follow lemmings like you appearently do. A red herring is a red herring, no matter how many colors you post it in NO!

Ingus! I'm so glad that you have been on these forums a lot longer than I have,... else some would probably wonder if I had just created your profile to contrast my points against in the threads.

But for the sake of a debate on abortion, they are just that ""too general."" The abortion debate is more of a concern for ""individual"" rights and not just rights in general,.... so the debate itself needs to be more focused on the ""individual"" aspects of a person's life, rights etc. (Namely,.. ""when does a human ""individual's"" life begin and what are their rights to the life they are living?"") Our constitution is clear in the 5th and 14th Amendments that all ""persons"" have a right to their life and that right can not be denied, except by due process. It becomes therefor, imperitive,... that we fix the debate upon the specifics of when an individual's life begins. So, here we are.... doing just that!","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","01:04 PM","abortion-debates","598"
