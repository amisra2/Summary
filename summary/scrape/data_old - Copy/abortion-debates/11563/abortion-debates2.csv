"09-06-2008","11563",2,"chester","322807","As though one had anything to do with the other.","chloe","322810","Your objection to outlawing abortion on the grounds that you don't think the government should tell a woman what she should do with her health should lead you be against nationalized health care. With nationalized health care the government will determine the medical treatments women get in their healthcare. They will be making decisions for women in many many many more health issues than pregnancy. I am against national healthcare and believe that women (even men for that matter) can make decisions for themselves regarding their own health. With regard to abortion - which is the killing of a human life - I think there should be a law against killing 8 month old babies who are inside a womb as there are laws against killing 7 month old babies who have been outside of the womb for .0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 00000000000000000000000000000000001 seconds. Just as there are laws against killing 4 year olds, 10 year olds, 46 year olds and so on. As I am sure you know there were laws against abortion in the past before a few judges decided to decisionalize whether or not 40,000,000+ people get to continue living or are allowed to be killed. Personally, I disagree that 3 or 4 judges should be allowed to stand between a baby and their obstetrician and pediatrician. You asked, ""Why do they have such a deep distrust of a woman's ability to make decisions?"" There is no magical deep distrust of a woman's ability to make decisions that exists with those who are pro life. This is a wrong perception. I fear you have been led astray by the liberal feminist pro abortion movement to equate women's rights and feminism with abortion rights. They would have you believe they are one and the same but they are not. Governor Palin is an amazing example and proof that women's rights + feminism are not the same as abortion rights.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:00 PM","abortion-debates","19"

Your question is quite vague. With respect to the medical management and care of a woman during pregnancy I think the woman (less so) and her physician (more so) are best qualified and informed to manage the pregnancy. I don't think a Washington bureaucrat should be placed between the woman and her doctor which is what will happen when nationalized healthcare is instituted. With respect to whether I think the government (a representation of the people of America) should not allow someone a choice to terminate their pregnancy - I think our society should not afford one this choice. There is no such thing as a universal right to ones own body. Oh brother.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","05:21 PM","abortion-debates","29"

OK then. Since ""society should not afford one this choice"", just what sanction do you believe is appropriate for those who ""choose to terminate their pregnanc[ies]""? Surely you accept the idea that, should society choose to ""not afford one this choice"", there must be a way for society to enforce its will on those who defy it. So then, please lay out for the forum the nature and extent of your proposed sanction, and, while you are at it, tell the forum against whom you think it should apply - the now no longer pregnant woman, her physician, or others. Remember that if the profetallifers consider the ""unborn"" to be the most innocent members of society, there must be a sanction that serves as both punishment in THIS case and a deterrent in FUTURE ones.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","06:01 PM","abortion-debates","30"
