Which I indicated in many of the definitions I posted.","Colonel Ingus","345790","LOL I Love it. You just keep sticking your foot deeper and deeper into your mouth with every post Here's a question for ya, how many MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS use "" Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary "" as a resource? Maybe just the quack anti-choice so-called ""doctors"" who like to put out junk science. LOL","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:37 PM","abortion-debates","601"
"03-02-2009","11563",41,"Archangel","345791","Try defending the drivel you spew ingus, rather than worrying about definitions which you can't oppose or deny with evidence.","Colonel Ingus","345792","Why do I hear you saying that with a Daffy Duck voice? As for your baseless accusations, just walk into ANY doctors office and ask them if they use ""Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary"" as their prime resource. LOL","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:54 PM","abortion-debates","603"

For some reason,.. I have less reason to doubt their credibility than I do yours.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:57 PM","abortion-debates","604"

Don't try to peddle backwards now. Admit your mistakes and deal with them And it's precisely that kind of ""reasoning"" that makes you a anti-choicer.

LOL","Archangel","345797","Because that's the sound of your own voice obviously. My question isn't about which medical dictionary is best you schmuck, I already know that MWs is fine and used by many doctors. My question is why haven't you supported your claim in months now that a fetus, a ZEF and a zygote are true parasites according to any medical dictionary of your choice. Why did you run away till now and still refuse to answer the question if what you say is true? The answer is, because it isn't true. You must dehumanize unborn babies in order to justify killing them. That is no better than a brutal despot who fills mass graves with innocent victims which is precisely what you pro death advocates do at every turn with your philosophy of infanticide.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:27 PM","abortion-debates","606"

Too bad it's not as funny as what you say when you are trying to be serious . LOL Of course not because that would PROVE that you are wrong That's the first correct thing that you've ever said on these boards. Congratulations! You must dehumanize women in order to justify trying to control them . I'll tell you what Einstein, I'd much rather dehumanize a clump of cells than to dehumanize a REAL PERSON You're posts reflect that you're obviously not educated enough to understand what that last sentence meant","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","11:05 PM","abortion-debates","607"

I post this link as evidence of why teenagers shouldn't be allowed on adult forums. http://www.4forums.com/political/abo...tml#post345801 along with my previous post which ingus redacted.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","11:15 PM","abortion-debates","608"
