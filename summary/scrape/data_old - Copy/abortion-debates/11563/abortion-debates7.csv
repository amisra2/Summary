Unless you're claiming that the brain and the soul are fictional, as are the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny? If that's the claim you're making, then you really need to get a clue and the first sentence I wrote is accurate.","Shooterandproud","323334","The brain exists and has a function. Not so sure about the soul. This statement is not juvenile or off topic. You are using something fictional while debating, what could be more juvenile than that? And threatening another debater with the use of prejudice and ageism doesn't make you look intelligent. Calling BS on the use of something completely unproven is not juvenile or off topic.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","12:42 AM","abortion-debates","91"

Read your previous post and you'll clearly see that it was ""YOU"" who compared the tooth fairy to the easter bunny in comparison to the existence of the brain and the soul. So how do you then that I AM using something fictional? Stop playing the victim shooter. Nobody has threatened anyone at all, nor promoted prejudice against you at all. And you're being redundant by even using both words together since ageism means to be prejudice on the basis of a persons age. So show where I have promoted prejudice against you in any way! ageism |jizm| (also agism) noun prejudice or discrimination on the basis of a person's age.

"09-11-2008","11563",7,"Galactababe","323341","Do you also support the ""right"" of a minor to get an abortion without parental approval Cappy ? Would you be all fine and happy with your 14 year old granddaughter getting knocked up and getting an abortion without her parents knowing? Who would you sue or blame if the procedure went south and your granddaughter died?","chester","323350","If the alternative is having the government tell her what she can or cannot do with her body, then the answer is, ""Yes! Yes! A thousand times YES!"" On the other hand, I am sure that my hypothetical 14-year old granddaughter (not there yet) will have received comprehensive sex education, including the need for the use of contraception each and every time, from both her school and her parents. Oh, I forgot, the right wingnuts in our country don't want comprehensive sex ed in the schools either. Now, would you want the government to tell YOUR 14-year old granddaughter that, should she be impregnated by a molester within your family, that she will have to bear the child? BTW, I guess you now are admitting that your pro-choice comments were lies. Thanks for the admission. You really don't like it when your very words come back to haunt you, do you, sweetie. Do you really think that criminalizing abortion will stop it? If you do criminalize it, what will your proposed sanctions be and upon whom will they be applied? Are you and the country really ready to see women hauled off to prison for the ""crime"" of terminating their pregnancies? What about physicians?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:20 AM","abortion-debates","94"
"09-11-2008","11563",7,"None","None","None","chester","323367","babe, Nice rant; now answer the question. Just in case you forgot, the question was, ""If your 14-year old daughter were impregnated as a result her of being molested by a family member, would you want the government to tell her that she had to bear the child so conceived?"" The key here is the government . Still saying ""Marxist"" as though it were a bad thing, we see. BTW, just how ""hefty"" a fine are you proposing?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","12:22 PM","abortion-debates","96"
"09-11-2008","11563",7,"Galactababe","323378","Cappy: I would think that the fines would have to vary from State to State and be reflective of the cost of living index in each area. In an area like NY, something along the lines of $2,500 to the patient and $5,000 to the doctor performing the procedure.","chester","323383","Why you old softie you. You really do think that this small fine is sufficient sanction for, how did you put it again? Oh, yes, I have your words now, ""Or, a woman can immorally and (hopefully soon to be) illegally choose to find an abortionist to rip the growing life from within her."" Whoever would have thought that the babe would be soft on crime. BTW, it's nice that YOU approve of abortion in the case of rape or incest, but that wasn't the question at all. The question was about how you would react if the government said your 14-year old granddaughter had to carry the baby to term.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","02:13 PM","abortion-debates","98"

With laws like that, women will be dropping like flies from having back alley abortions. When you give someone a fundamental right, then try to take it away again, they're going to keep exercising that right no matter what the law says. Do you really think it should be done with a coat hanger? Do you think its ok to force a 14 year old pregnant girl to tell her abusive parents about her pregnancy? Do you think depriving kids of comprehensive sex ed is ""moral""? How hypocritical.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","07:13 PM","abortion-debates","100"
"09-11-2008","11563",7,"None","None","None","chester","323430","Shooter, Good observations. Rich women have always had access to abortions, either through clandestine physicians or foreign travel. You might want to Google the name Sherry (or Sheri?) Finkbine (Finkbein?) for reference. The babe's children can have babies until they can't have any more for all I care; that's their choice. I just don't want my daughters and granddaughters to have their right to choose taken away by some busybodies.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","07:51 PM","abortion-debates","101"
"09-12-2008","11563",7,"Galactababe","323474","Cappy: I replied, AGAIN, that I approve of abortion in the case of rape or incest where a pregnancy has resulted as the result of the woman's/young lady's free will being violated. What is it about my answer that you are unable to grasp?","chester","323475","The part that is an answer to the question. Once again, it's not relevant what you think the law SHOULD say; it's what you would say/feel/do in the situation where the law forbids what you approve of - abortion ""in the case of rape or incest where a pregnancy has resulted as the result of the woman's/young lady's free will being violated."" Remember that in Sarah Palin's ideal world and in the world of the true believer in the righttofetallife movement, the exemption you seek would be precluded. In that event, would you take her for an ""illegal"" abortion, knowing that both you and the doctor would be fined a relatively paltry sum? BTW, I love watching you go ballistic when I quote your words back at you, especially those relating to choices and sanctions. That's not twisting a thing, sweetie; I just quote you and stand back waiting for the explosion.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","08:09 AM","abortion-debates","103"
