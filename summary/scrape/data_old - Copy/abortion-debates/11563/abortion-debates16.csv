It is a delicate issue for both sides. Keep in mind that were there no other issue involved then allowing the fetus to grow and develop would be so obvious as to almost disallow debate. While I agree that there is virtually no benefit that would justify the cost of the loss of freedom that would necessarily occur were the gov't to disallow abortion, we cannot lose sight of the fact that there is a reason for the opposition.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","12:10 AM","abortion-debates","226"

What I can never understand is how that opposition can be transferred, via the overweening power of government, to anyone else's family.

"09-19-2008","11563",16,"Phyllis","324207","You can only legally kill a burglar if you have good reason to believe that your life is in danger. Should you arrive one day at your house and discover a burglar who clearly poses no threat to your person, you may not legally kill him though he walk out with all your earthly possessions. Yes, the burglar may be infringing upon your liberty, but you may not kill him because of that. If you must analogize it to the burglar, than it would apply this way. Most pro-life people agree that abortions that are necessary to save the mother's life are acceptable. What most pro-lifers do not agree with is that abortion is acceptable in situations where only a person's liberty or property might be infringed, but where it would not be necessary to save her life.","Shooterandproud","324229","Not in all states. Most states have adopted castle doctrine by now. Still, invading a home is one thing, a body is another. Having something inside the plaster walls of your house is different than having something invasive inside of you.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","12:42 AM","abortion-debates","228"

"09-19-2008","11563",16,"None","None","None","Ryuuichi","324288","Alright fine its a women's body. Since its her body we should allow her to do whatever she wants with it. At this point I really don't care. If she gets pregant and decided to keep it she should be on her own. That's her decision, no help from the government, no help from anyone that doesn't willing want to give it. If she wants to get a abortion the same rules apply. Fine let's not waste time or resources being responsible for people who deem themselves responsible enough to handle consequences. That's it I really don't give a hoot anymore. Our government should mind its own business and let people float or sink on their own. I don't see why it even interferes as much as it did. Our taxes shouldn't be wasted trying to support someone else's decision. Something personal that belonged to only them. They should dig that money out of their own pocket and deal with their business. This whole pro-life and pro-choice argument wouldn't even matter if the gov't realised that. I suppose a fetus isn't a human being then? I suppose for the first year of your life you weren't a human being just something else. Something freakishly inane and strange. A non-being if you will. You were a parasite that was most likely willing placed into your host. Then that host decided to keep you for who knows what reason and either raise you or give you to another to be raised. Abortion is simply the destruction of the parasite. So in the end I guess a human being life is nothing more than a statstic eh? The destruction of a parasite feeding on the earth. Not that I really care. Some kid offs himself *shrug* another statistic, some woman was raped and butched *shrug* another statistic it makes no difference anymore. The Twin Towers *shrugs* Terriost attacks are common everywhere else. Global Warming? People are bound to go exinct...we just have a rough timeline now. Raids and genoicide? So what who cares their just people who are inconviencing me. My country wastes money trying to help them. They are merely an inconvience therefore they are expendable. All human life is expendable. We are no more important than dogs or cats. We place far to much value on ourselves as well as far to much importance. Human beings can destroy the world Feh! The only thing that will be destroyed are human beings. Though yes now that I've come to my senses I see there really isn't an issue it's a woman's choice, her body. If the woman wants to kill her child let her do it. Just let her do it out of her own pocket. If I man wants to abandon his child let him do that as well. The government shouldn't intervene in family matters at all wheter abuse, incest, neglect or rape is going on its none of their business. That is personal business after all especially if the victim denies it. So where is the line for personal business and the government's business. Is it right for a 12 year old girl to give her body (its hers after all) to a 40 year old man and there not be a problem? It was of her own free will.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","03:50 PM","abortion-debates","234"

Truly there isnt. The entire pro-choice mentality is denying that there should be legal consequences for choosing to terminate. There is nothing wrong with thinking that abortion is unpleasant or that women should choose to keep their pregnancies. It is just important to recognize the difference between disagreeing with what a woman does with her life and controlling a womans life. This is a philosophical question, is it not? I enjoy hearing different opinions on the subjects so, please, share your thoughts, Ryuuichi . There is a man who had his brain removed from his body. His brain is still fully conscious and can see and talk out of special equipment. His body is kept alive, and is unchanged besides the missing brain. Where is the person, the being ? Does he still exist? Free will means something different when you talk about minors :-\ Whether this is good or bad is another issue.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","04:30 PM","abortion-debates","236"

She might have had more pull as a Mayor or Governor, but she cannot reverse Rox v Wade by herself. She will preside over the Senate, meaning she will maintain Roberts Rules of Order and cast her vote in cases of 50/50 ties. Other than that, she will be relatively powerless.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","04:39 PM","abortion-debates","237"
