You talk out of both sides of your mouth and then try and twist my words to suit your Marxist agenda. I PREFER women to see a pregnancy through to birth. I feel exceptions should be made in the case of rape/incest where a woman is forced to have sex against her will, or where the mother's life is medically in danger. In such cases, the CHOICE of doing what she wants with her body was taken away from her. Therefore, the only hypothetical case where a woman is FORCED BY THE GOVERNMENT to not have control over her own body would be if an abortion was prevented under those circumstances. In all others, the woman CHOSE to have unprotected sex and should bear the consequences of that CHOICE. Our positions differ because of the point in time which we recognize ""choice"" as taking place. I do not think getting an illegal abortion should be punishable with jail time as you keep trying to insist I do, but that a hefty fine to both the doctor and woman would serve as a deterrent. You then accuse me of being ""soft"" on crime and that only the ""rich"" will be able to afford abortions. Which is it?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:43 AM","abortion-debates","176"

Obviously people don't give a darn about many of the laws in this country and do as they damn please anyway. However, there are repercussions, depending on which choice a pregnant woman makes. If she chooses to murder a defenseless, voiceless baby, is she claiming self-defense? Or is she pleading temporary insanity at the time of conception? I think the decision should be made under conditions where our government makes it easier to get pre-natal care and place babies into the adoption system with less red tape. I think the choice to give life and carry it to term, regardless of how that life came to be (with the exception of rape victims) should become the preferred choice, because it is the right thing to do. Not because God says so, not because pro-lifers say so, but because we all need to be responsible for our actions. Please note that you make no qualification for rape and incest victims. In fact you make a point of saying it's your preferred choice ""regardless of how that life came to be"". Well, guess what, it's my preferred choice as well. But it is a choice, not the only choice, and by saying that, you clearly believe that, although they may not be your PREFERRED choice, other choices should exist. Now, please stop accusing others of twisting your words; they speak quite eloquently for themselves. Now, will any of you profetallifers please tell us why you think the government is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","12:13 PM","abortion-debates","179"

They start whining about how men would abuse this (like women don't already) and how it makes the irresponsible (as if the women who do the same thing are somehow above being irresponsible especially those who use it as birth control.) I'm waiting for attitudes like that to bit them in the butt eventually and abortions only be made accessible under the conditions of rape, incest and danger to the mother. [Note when talking about irresponsibility and abuse the latter three conditions weren't included] Well at least the pro-lifers would be happy. Though its a woman's body. You make a choice over your own body and reproduction rights. Their YOUR rights. Neither the government or your partner who got you pregnant/you got pregnant should have any say over your choice to become a mother/father. Are those not basic human rights? The right to decide who you want to procreate with? As well as when you want to do it?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","01:19 PM","abortion-debates","180"
