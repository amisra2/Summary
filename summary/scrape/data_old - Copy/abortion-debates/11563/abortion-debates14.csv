Should I therefore be denied medical attention because I need to be ""responsible""? I really don't get it when people say they want women to be ""responsible"" and carry the baby to term. How is that responsible? Its not what the woman wants, so why punish her with it? To teach her a lesson?","Ryuuichi","324147","Because she knew the risks of something she did. Its like having someone knock someone's teeth out and walk away without a problem. Or cutting your wrists because you enjoy the sensation, eventually your luck is going to run out. Yes allowing people to take responsibility for their actions is evil and shouldn't be allowed. *facepalms* That's why the government forces men to pay for their kids when they know the father to make him take responsibility. That's why when you knock someone's teeth out they can make you pay their medical bills and may jail you for assalt. That's why child molesters when caught go to prison. That's why DWI can result in suspension or losing your license. That's supposed to be why dumpster babies are supposed to result in the mother going to prison. And your pervious examples are totally different scenarios. You walking across the street doesn't make you responsible for getting hit by a car unless you're idiot enough to walk across a speeding highway. You shouldn't be denied medical attention because the only one in danger was you. (unless you caused someone to swerve and hit something then in due process you should be jailed and fined depending on the severity if their condition) Though if you lack insurance you should get basic care. Its like this country wants to encourage irresponsibility and make us more dependant on the government. Please don't feed me that fetus aren't human beings Bs either. In 9 months it sure in heck doesn't become a zebra or some inanimate object. Its a stage in human development that is all. It is not a dead or non leaving creature. It is a human being in the first stages of development. There's nothing that disgusts me more than pro-choicers insisting that fetuses aren't human beings. And I'm pro choice so don't start acting like I'm some women hater and want her to be punished by forcing her to carry her child to term. I feel this way either we all take responsibility for our stunts or no one does its unfair to make someone pay for their actions and the rest all go free. But what the hell let's all make it easier for the government to eventually step in with the guise of ""protecting and saving all human lives"" and become a country where if you want a child you better sign the waiting list. Because we abused our right to procreate and the government finds it in the best interest of the country and its people to do it that way. I don't mind abortion I really don't but the simple fact that its become such an issue raises an alarm as to the fact that people should realise that abortion is a last resort . 1.3 million women are far to many for it to have been a last resort for all of them.

But you are right, I don't speak for all women. I speak for those who respect the wonder of human life and who are willing to accept responsibility for their sexual actions. You have a very twisted view of human rights. Then again, I suppose you agree that raising taxes is ""patriotic""...... All of your bloviating, lying, misogyny, and temper tantrums in defense of women who want to use abortion as belated birth control is just pathetic and laughable.","chester","324151","You do know, of course, that if you must resort to ad homs that you have lost the substantive debate, but that's normal for the righties.

If you get into a car accident, should the government tell the firefighters they are not allowed to cut a person out of that car? You call forcible and invasive laws ""allowing""? No, that's so the kid and his mom has enough money for a half decent life. An ""assalt"" and pregnancy are two very different things that should be treated differently. So we should punish pregnant women like we do child molesters? Good idea. You should run for office. You knew that by walking someplace you are more likely to be hit and you took that risk. Therefore, does that person deserve medical attention? The only one to consider in an unwanted pregnancy is the women. You are basing this on a protein sequence. The basis for human rights is mental existence, which a fetus lacks. It is therefore only a group of living cells, such as a leaf. Wow, THAT doesn't contradict your whole post... This archaic view on sex is outdated. People have the right to have sex without fear of the government or pregnancy. If pregnancy should result from a failed contraceptive, then punishing them for doing the one thing that humans were made for would not be fair. If it were as a result of unprotected sex, then that person is stupid. However the last thing we want to do is punish stupid people with children. I agree, however better education will remedy that.

Your philosophy here belies the underlying view of you do the crime, you do the time while forgetting that sex is not a crime. Nor should pregnancy be viewed or used as a learning tool to teach women responsibility. Yes, women should take responsibility for their actions but you confuse personal responsibility with governmentally enforced responsibility. If, for the sake of the argument, I accept your view that abortion is irresponsible (which is not necessarily true, btw) I would still believe that women should be free to be irresponsible. And selfish. And, to a certain extent, self-destructive. Women are not your children and we are not here to protect them from themselves. What is a human being? As a philosophical question, a human being is a mental creature. Were you to take my brain out of my body that brain would be a human being while the body would merely have human DNA. The locus of my being , my existence , would be in the jar that contains my brain. Without a sufficiently complex brain the fetus is like the brainless body lying on the table. It has human DNA but has little significance beyond that. This is true. This is not true. Either a life is sacred and should not be killed or it is not.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","06:52 PM","abortion-debates","205"

I don't see what being a citizen has to do with anything, since the states seem to be allowed to prohibit the murder of all people whether they are citizens or not. So we can set that one aside. As for whether they are human beings under the law, well, we do know that fetal homicide laws provide criminal sanctions against the person who would cause the death of the child developing within her unborn mother's womb. In fact, California's penal code defines this act as ""murder."" But the issue of Roe v. Wade is not ultimately about whether the Constitution defines persons. It is simply whether the individual states have the authority to legislate this issue however it desires as it does many other issues. The answer to that question is fairly obvious under rational principles of Constitutional interpretation. The obvious answer is that there is nothing in the Constitution that can be construed to deny the power of the individual states to regulate abortion, a power they had exercised since the early 1800s.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","07:44 PM","abortion-debates","208"

To the extent that they rely on substantive due process theories, they are in la la land. Any decision that relies on that therory is de facto incorrect. But even if one does not think so, the court was wrong in Roe because they misapplied the doctrine of substantive due process. There is nothing fundamental about the right to abortion as that term is used in Constitutional law. Our established method of substantive due process analysis has two primary features: First, we have regularly observed that the Due Process Clause specially protects those fundamental rights and liberties which are, objectively, ""deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition ,"" id., at 503 (plurality opinion); Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 105 (1934) (""so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental""), and ""implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,"" such that ""neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed,"" Palko v.

Roe based itself upon the right to privacy , not any ""right to abortion"". The substantive component of the Due Process Clause was correctly applied to this concept. Under Substantive Due Process, without a compelling State need to restrict the woman's freedom or violate her privacy disallowing abortion was not justified and so was struck down. Privacy is ""implicit in the concept of ordered liberty"". Justice Potter Stewart, a judge on the Roe v Wade case said in his concurring opinon: Several decisions of this Court make clear that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . As recently as last Term, in Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438, 453, we recognized ""the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child."" That right necessarily includes the right of a woman to decide whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","08:04 PM","abortion-debates","210"
