"09-24-2008","11563",23,"Archangel","324980","And don't forget that proponents of abortion can skew poll results by asking questions that get the answers they want. For example, I was polled once and the question regarding abortion was, ""Do you support the woman's right to end her pregnancy in the event of rape or incest?"" We all know that the majority of Americans would answer YES to that question. But to then extrapolate from that that I would support abortion on demand is totally false, but that is what that poll was used to do. So let's not think for a minute that the opposition is either honest or truthful in supporting their criminal agenda. They understand the importance of perception, even if that perception is based on a lie.","chester","324988","And are we to suppose that the profetallifers never, NEVER manipulate thier questions to give them the desired effect? BTW, you know you won't ever answer my question because you know that to admit that you need the assistance of government to enforce your warped values means that you're on the wrong side of the moral issue involved.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:14 AM","abortion-debates","331"

The suggestion is absurd. I wonder how you, as a moral relativist, can even come to the conclusion that somebody is on the wrong side of a moral issue.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:29 AM","abortion-debates","332"

Why not simply admit up front that your ""side"" has FAILED in its pathetic attempts at moral suasion, and now you feel you need to resort to the force of law to impose your values on those who do not share them.

Because Roe is a decision that causes the Government to enforce the right to this policy of infanticide. But you're too blind to realize that, huh? And by what warped standard of rationale can you say that standing against the brutal murder of around 1.4 MILLION UNBORN BABIES PER YEAR IN AMERICA is having warped values and on the WRONG side of the moral issue? Please prove that reprobate belief is true at all if you can.

A quick survey of the history reveals that a sufficient number of people thought abortion was wrong to the degree that most state legislatures were persuaded to prohibit abortion in the years prior to Roe v. Wade . It wasn't the other way around. However, it took 7 Supreme Court justices exercising their power illegitimately to establish the right to choice. Therefore, it was the abortion movement that was (and still has been) unable to persuade the population at large that they are in the right. This is just a guess, but that may simply be due to the fact that the abortion movement has its roots in the morally bankrupt ground of eugenics and racism. The moral high ground indeed.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:05 AM","abortion-debates","335"

If there is such an upswelling of support, you and your ilk could have done it via the state convention route. The fact that you have not even tried shows the intellectual and moral bankruptcy of your position. The people of America, given a taste of choice, will not go back to being dictated to. The South Dakota vote last year provided ample evidence. Brown and West Virginia v. Barnette are proof of that. The women of America will never again be shoved to the back of the bus.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","12:16 PM","abortion-debates","338"
"09-24-2008","11563",23,"Phyllis","325038","We simply do not know this to be the case simply because the people of America have not been given the opportunity to express their will. The Supreme Court took that choice away from them. So much for getting a taste of choice.","chester","325040","Whatever you do, don't insult the intelligence of those who post here. You and your ilk have had 38 years to spew your propaganda, so please spare us the hearts and flowers. You have had more than enough time to win the argument in this country; the fact that you have not been able to do so speaks to its bankruptcy. Yes, it did take 70+ years to eliminate slavery, and now you want to overturn that as well and make a woman a slave to her fetus. NICE!!","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","12:44 PM","abortion-debates","340"

ABC News/Washington Post Poll. Aug. 19-22, 2008. N=1,108 adults nationwide. MoE 3. Fieldwork by TNS. RV = registered voters Do you think abortion should be legal in all cases, legal in most cases, illegal in most cases, or illegal in all cases? 8/19-22/08: 22% said always legal, 32% said mostly legal, 26% said mostly illegal, 18% said always illegal, with 3% saying unsure. Combining the results give 54% thinking abortion should at least be mostly legal with 44% being pro-life with few if any exceptions. Pew Research Center for the People & the Press survey. July 31-Aug. 10, 2008. N=2,905 adults nationwide. MoE 2. Aug. 2007 survey conducted by Schulman, Ronca & Bucuvalas. Do you think abortion should be legal in all cases, legal in most cases, illegal in most cases, or illegal in all cases?"" Options rotated. 7/31 - 8/10/08: 17% always legal, 37% mostly legal, 26% mostly illegal, 15% always illegal, with 5% unsure. This gives 54% at least mostly legal and 41% illegal with few exceptions at most. Of course there are more that show that the majority of the nation is pro-choice and this has been pretty consistently true for quite a while if you look at the trends.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","01:40 PM","abortion-debates","343"

They will have taken away a person's ability to give birth by their own choice. That is a pretty significant freedom to have, imo. Certainly there are other factors involved, but what I have said here is also true.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","03:36 PM","abortion-debates","344"
