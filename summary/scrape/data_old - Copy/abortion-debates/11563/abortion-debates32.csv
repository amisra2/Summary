"10-07-2008","11563",32,"Colonel Ingus","326415","What is even more hypocritical is that if the woman dies while giving birth to this unwanted ZEF, that it is not held accountable for her murder!","Ryuuichi","326638","*facepalms* I highly doubt the ZEF wanted its source of food and shelter dead. Heck using that arguement I can blame the mother for her body not being fit enough to carry a child to term if she miscarries. Therefore by not keeping herself healthy she killed the ZEF. Ugh...I'm pro-choice but some of choicers arguements make me disgusted. ZEF's don't count as being human (unless of course someone other than a licensed physican with the apporval of the mother kills it :roll eyes: That makes buckets of sense) and no person under the age of 7 can be tried for murder anyway. >_> What's next we start sending little kids who steal candy from the store to jail?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","01:10 PM","abortion-debates","467"

If a fetus, or a fertilized egg, or a zygote, embryo, et al, is truly a legal human person -- and if a pregnancy causes the death of a woman, why shouldn't the so-call ""legal human person"" be tried for murder?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","01:47 PM","abortion-debates","468"

Weird. BTW-many parasites kill their host. Sorry, try again. First of all it's HER body, and therefore her property and she can do with it as she pleases. Second of all that's not why women have miscarriages Criminally negligent homicide works just as well","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","01:51 PM","abortion-debates","469"

Ugh nevermind you think the ZEF is some alien life form that should either have all or no human rights. I agree. Its an object. So if I kill it I assaulted the woman nothing more nothing less. There is no mother right to choose to get rid of her offspring its a mother's choice to get rid of something growing inside of her. And if I make that choice for her I simply attacked her body I didn't kill anyone. ^_^ There's no one to kill.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","02:01 PM","abortion-debates","470"

Humans, by nature, are not physical parasites. That's basic biology. Alien life forms should have rights, as long as they mentally exist. This makes a lot of sense.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","11:55 PM","abortion-debates","471"

One of many reasons that I could understand why a pregnant woman - wouldn't want to be pregnant anymore If by alien you mean illegal alien I would rather give rights to an alien life form, then to a ZEF. At least it isn't leeching off the woman against her will","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","01:48 AM","abortion-debates","472"
"10-08-2008","11563",32,"None","None","None","Ryuuichi","326839","*sighs* I wonder when the government will finally sterilize everyone from puberty in the name of the greater good and harvest their eggs and sperm, create incubators to make people and eventually get rid of every undesirable person in the world. I hate to say it but the whole pro-life pro-choice actually make me want the government to go this route. That way you want a kid you have to go through the system and a majority of the people willing to do that will actually want the kid. That's the only way this argument is going to end. I can't wait to see how outraged both groups become when its finally proposed and eventually enforced. Oh and before you start saying that's illegal and against others rights the government can just say they are protecting the lives of humans (last I checked human BEINGS not American CITIZENS is what the Bill of Rights referred too) and enforce it. I don't care that you don't think a ZEF is a human it is a human being, maybe not a fully formed one but its a human being. [And don't start with the its similar to my toe honestly not only is it completely unsupported but its laughable. So when we live inside our mommies we're not humans? What are we then? Aliens, UFOs something that doesn't exist. Wait..we're HUMAN fetus? I wonder why? *ponders* Last I checked a egg was a whatever the creature that laid it egg. A chicken egg doesn't become an eagle if the eagle chooses to nest on it.] And humans can arguably be called parasitic on this planet. What do humans do for the world in the end? Nothing we destroy it. The Ecosystem would function just fine (if not a load better) without us.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","01:14 PM","abortion-debates","473"

Not all will make it, and even some that do will be damaged in the process.

There is no scientific reason to characterize a raisin-size lump of cells as a human being. Biologically speaking, such an embryo is far more primitive than a fish or a bird. Anatomically, its brain has yet to develop, so in terms of its capacity for consciousness, it doesn't bear the remotest similarity to a human being . This growth of cells has the potential to become a human being--if preserved, fed, nurtured, and brought to term by the woman that it depends on-- but it is not actually a human being . Analogously, seeds can become mature plants--but that hardly makes a pile of acorns equal to a forest. link","Colonel Ingus","326853","Ah ... but that's the whole problem, in your bullying narcissistic attitude it is true - you don't care about the FACTS of the matter , just you're own feelings This is true about most anti-choicers. Sadly to them, the woman is invisible . Thank you for your honesty, even if you didn't think that anyone would catch it. It's obvious from your posts that you are not open-minded, but try to consider these facts:","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","01:55 PM","abortion-debates","476"
"10-08-2008","11563",32,"None","None","None","Ryuuichi","326855","Um hate to burst your bubble but I never said that I thought abortion was wrong because the ZEF is a developing human being. Heck I don't find anything wrong. If you want to do something and you have to power to do it go ahead. I really could care less. I don't care if a woman decides to have a abortion, no abortion, adopt a kid or whatever but I don't want her complaining about others being able to do the same. [Laughably most pro-choicers I met the second I extended it to men start making pro-life arguments against men. Honestly its lulzy.] Though fine if it makes you lot feel better about it than fine its not a developing human being. And a fetus is more comparable to a sprout than a acorn anyways.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","02:07 PM","abortion-debates","477"
