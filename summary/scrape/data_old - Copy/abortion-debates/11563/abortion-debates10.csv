"09-13-2008","11563",10,"yes","323626","instead of letting tramps kill babies - perhaps we should get the irresponsible degenerates FIXED like all the dogs that so many people want to help What the heck - let them screw like dogs and get their STD's & HIV THEY DON'T CARE - they refuse to take responsibility for their own actions ... JUST like a pack of dog's ... Let them get treated comparable to the way they act","Shooterandproud","323644","You are making no sense. Its a little more complicated than that. First of all, humans are not dogs, and we have more rights than dogs. Second of all, how do you think people should take responsibility? Have kids? That sounds an awful lot like punishing women with unwanted pregnancies with children. Not a good idea, IMO. I am all for freedom of the people. If you don't like abortions, don't have them. Simple as that.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","11:51 PM","abortion-debates","137"

Sexually transmitted disease has gotten worse and more deadly but SO WHAT? Right?

If ONLY you ALL were gay then there wouldn't be any abortion. what is the difference between people doing each other like dogs dogs doing each other like dogs MORALLY: not much!

And what ""anti morals"" are you referring to? Do you wish everyone who does not adhere to your outdated belief system get a deadly STD? Um... no. Women with unwanted pregnancies want to fix it on their own by finding an abortion doctor. We want the government OUT of it. .. Good luck paying more tax for those 1.4million babies to be fed and clothed. What about all those wonderful carbon emissions and trash they will produce in their lifetime? This planet cannot afford more people. Good for you, however that does not do anything for you if you are still adhering to archaic ""morals"" Is this a joke?

Abortion is immoral, wrong, and contrary to the will of ""God"" - except if it is contemplated by the child of the profetallife Governor of the Igloo State.

"09-15-2008","11563",10,"Penfold","323740","The abstinence indoctrination obviously didn't take.","Archangel","323741","Neither did the sex ed. http://www.newwest.net/topic/article...ate/C564/L564/ Given all of this, the irony would be hair-curling indeed if it turned out that Alaska practices abstinence-only sex education, but I can find no definite evidence that it does although its going to, as discussed below. Alaska does not currently receive federal Title V funds. As of 2002, the Kaiser Family Foundation publication that I mentioned earlier reported that Alaska was in a category of states requiring only that abstinence be stressed, but not necessarily to the exclusion of so-called comprehensive sex education. On the other hand, Alaska also did not require contraception information in sex ed classes at that time. (PDF here.) Of course, just because Alaska is not receiving federal Title V funding does not mean the state is not practicing abstinence-only sex education, but I cant prove it one way or the other on line. Alaska curriculum standards (available as a PDF here) contain nothing more specific than the requirement that students understand the physical and behavioral characteristics of human sexual development and maturity and understand the ongoing life changes throughout the life span and healthful responses to these changes. (As a side note that everyone should keep in mind when we talk about curriculum standards, it is often a stretch to assume that there is any connection between what the bureaucrats dream up and what teachers actually do behind their closed classroom doors, although one might reasonably assume that, the more potentially controversial a subject, the more likely most teachers would be to follow district policy.)","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","07:03 AM","abortion-debates","147"

Face facts, the world has changed, and your choices are either to change with it or go extinct. That's the way of evolution and the world, you old dinosaur you.
