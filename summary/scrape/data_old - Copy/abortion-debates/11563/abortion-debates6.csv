"09-10-2008","11563",6,"Galactababe","323252","Geez, do you really think God doesn't KNOW which egg is going to split? Obviously He's not going to deliver a soul to a single fertilized egg that will imminently and darn near immediately become two human beings, silly rabbits! Precision and productivity is what God does best, therefore delivering only one soul when two are needed would be a mistake, now wouldn't it? ......","Penfold","323269","If this is true, then the original fertilised egg is soulless until it divides, which means that the soul cannot be delivered on conception, as commonly claimed, but at an unspecified time afterward......","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","03:24 PM","abortion-debates","77"

One has to have an open heart and mind to know God.","Penfold","323273","Occams razor suggests he doesn't answer because he isn't there. He only talks to the credulous, who are open to superstition.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","03:29 PM","abortion-debates","78"

One has to have an open heart and mind to know God.","sinjin","323274","To whom have I been rude? Certainly not you and to God would be impossible for the reason previously stated. I don't share your beliefs and that's all they are. Gone are the days when your sort could demand I show proper respect for your mythology or be punished. I generally do anyway out of common courtesy but you and others here are far too strident and insulting for that. Btw at what age was your heart and mind opened? What did you believe prior to that?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","03:47 PM","abortion-debates","79"
"09-10-2008","11563",6,"Galactababe","323277","And I believe you are being rude when you refer to ""my kind"" as believers of mythology. While I happen to enjoy Greek and Roman mythology, there is a difference. However, if you would like me to refer to your heathen, pagan ways, I'll be happy to do so.","sinjin","323279","There is no difference between them to my mind. You want special consideration for your beliefs without providing anything as evidence beyond anecdotal hearsay. I would not consider heathen or pagan as insult but heathen is more accurate in today's vernacular.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","04:28 PM","abortion-debates","81"

Well, clearly that's because you have a few synapses loose, a few cards short of a deck, not the sharpest knife in the drawer, 2 cents short of a dollar, must I go on?","sinjin","323285","Maybe so but you see what I mean about insulting. Please don't speak to me further about rudeness. I find it ironic that you think I'm dull-witted or mentally defective but it is you that hears voices in your head. Or were you only speaking metaphorically?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","05:27 PM","abortion-debates","85"

"09-10-2008","11563",6,"None","None","None","chester","323326","babe, Here's what you wrote, ""I think the decision should be made under conditions where our government makes it easier to get pre-natal care and place babies into the adoption system with less red tape. I think the choice to give life and carry it to term, regardless of how that life came to be (with the exception of rape victims) should become the preferred choice , because it is the right thing to do. Not because God says so, not because pro-lifers say so, but because we all need to be responsible for our actions."" I didn't mischaracterize a thing; all I did was quote you. It was you who used the word ""choice"" twice in the same sentence, so either you take ownership of what you wrote or admit you lied. BTW, this is what most of us in the pro-choice camp believe as well. Welcome aboard.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:58 PM","abortion-debates","90"
