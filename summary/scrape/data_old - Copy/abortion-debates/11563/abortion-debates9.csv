It would be like me asking you what your race was, because for some reason I don't debate with black people.","Colonel Ingus","323601","When someone who ""thinks"" only with their emotions like Galactababe does can't debate the facts, they often times will look for an excuse to 'bow out'. Age was their excuse. I'd rather see that then someone like AntiAngel who only regurgitates the same old rhetoric and misinformation over and over again.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","04:48 PM","abortion-debates","121"

Today he compared a womans right to choose with hitlers holocaust, so apparently he's no longer listening to the good Admin anymore... People like Archangel think that by repeating the same misinformation over and over again that people will start to absorb and believe it. It's a tactic called argumentum ad nauseam.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","05:18 PM","abortion-debates","123"
"09-13-2008","11563",9,"Galactababe","323609","Colonel Ingus You attempt to belittle me for ignoring facts about abortion, yet after a lengthy diatribe, you add the above. Just answer my question, how old are you? Because in your own mind, you may consider yourself an adult. I prefer HARD FACTS like YEAR OF BIRTH.","Shooterandproud","323625","That's completely irrelevant.

Ms. Palin is NOT the one wants to kill a child JUST TO DO IT AGAIN! People can make error's - BE REALISTIC the PROBLEM IS ... with those who want someone else to clean up their screw up and not be RESPONSIBLE FOR SELF .... You libs (who claim the right is too black and white or cut & dry (which ever cliche' you want to fancy at this moment) keep missing the point ... If you get knocked up once and need help - so be it ... adopt the baby out! Show some RESPECT FOR LIFE!

You fear the government's power under FISA, as I do, yet you have no problem with the government's intruding on the life of a pregnant woman. BIZARRE!!

Typical anti-choicer. Flap your lips but don't try to help. Way to go. LOL I fried some fish just last weekend. Next month I'll donate around $70,000 to some abortion rights groups, does that count? What? Are you just ignorant? Nobody kills babies, nor does anyone here support the killing of babies. Oh wait that's right, you're so busy yammering that you never actually learned the difference between a fetus and a baby. LOL No, I support good old American freedom of choice , unlike you right winged anti-American types.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:49 PM","abortion-debates","135"
