"09-12-2008","11563",8,"Galactababe","323478","Oh? Well, the law says a 14 year old can get an abortion without parental consent, whether the pregnancy is the result of rape or not. I think that's disgusting. Speculating as to what the Supreme Court might rule if Roe vs. Wade were to be reintroduced under a McCain/Palin white house is just that, pure speculation. Archangel posted results elsewhere in this forum regarding general opinion on the issue of rape and abortion and I am of the opinion that despite Palin's very fundamental religious beliefs, the vast majority would agree that such a condition is worthy of being an exception. Therefore your question, rephrased 20 ways to Sunday, is moot and ridiculous.","chester","323482","Still refusing to give a direct answer, we see. Tell us, were you the victim of a Jesuitical education? The question still remains, in the situation where, despite the protests, a profetallife Congress passes an antiabortion law with no exceptions - none, nada, bupkus, zilch - and if your 14-year old granddaughter is impregnated by a molesting family member, will you break the law or encourage her parents to break the law, knowing that the worst penalty is a paltry fine? Yes, it's a hypothetical situation at the present, but the real time profetallife screamers, Palin included, are pushing for just such a law. After all, if we should adopt their idiotic reasoning that ""Abortion is Murder"", then how can the nation sit back and permit some murders? BTW, for all you know, I may be up LATE!!","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:16 AM","abortion-debates","106"
"09-12-2008","11563",8,"Galactababe","323486","Just as it's not relevant what you think the law MIGHT be changed to.","chester","323495","Oh but it is. Even as I write, the profetallifers are organizing to create a law and/or Constitutional Amendment to do just that. Here in Colorado the people will vote this November on an Amendment to our Constitution defining a person as existing from the moment of conception. What do you think will happen to abortion in this state if that absurdity should pass?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:37 AM","abortion-debates","108"
"09-12-2008","11563",8,"None","None","None","sinjin","323501","Could someone please explain to me, from the religious perspective, why abortion would be acceptable in the case of rape? Is something wrong with the soul of the ""unborn"" in this case that would make its eviction palatable to God? This seems an instance of playing God that's viewed differently.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","11:04 AM","abortion-debates","109"
"09-12-2008","11563",8,"Galactababe","323526","He didn't say 'all'. I said 'all'. A 14 year old can't get a tonsillectomy without parental consent, why should they be allowed to go to Planned Parenthood to get an abortion arranged?","Colonel Ingus","323529","So I guess the next logic question is do you usually put words in other peoples mouths to win a debate? Their question was valid regarding abusive parents because said abusive parents would be taking away the 14 year olds constitutional rights. 14 year olds are not slaves, nor should they be treated as one. Oh I don't know, maybe because a tonsillectomy doesn't involve adding the responsibility of supporting another ( possibly unwanted ) life for the next 18 years. A tonsillectomy won't destroy a woman's life like an unwanted pregnancy would. There are plenty of valid reasons, even if you are too blind to admit to them that doesn't change the facts of the matter to the 14 year old involved. Basically all you are saying is that the unwanted ZEF has ( in your mind ) more rights than the 14 year old person, and to most people that wouldn't be logical.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","02:49 PM","abortion-debates","112"

"09-12-2008","11563",8,"Galactababe","323477","Shooterandproud: In answer to your first question, how have you arrived at the incorrect conclusion that ALL parents of ALL pregnant 14 year olds are abusive? In answer to your second question, I think you are a pretty darn good example of our failed comprehensive sex education in public schools. (sperm are human life) And yes, I think our public schools spend entirely too much time on social issues and not enough time on basic education. However, there should continue to be HS health classes, and yes 4th and 5th grade students should learn the basic reproductive functions their bodies will soon be capable of. State law permits parents to have their children opt out of such presentations if it conflicts with their religious beliefs. Do I believe 5 year olds need sex ed? No, I do not. Please cite where I stated kids should be ""deprived"" of comprehensive sex ed.","Shooterandproud","323561","So are you saying there are no abusive parents of 14 year old girls? Really? It doesn't matter if its all the parents, or some. Its still 14 year old girls being forced to tell their parents something they are not comfortable telling them for whatever reason. The ones with non abusive parents can tell their parents, and the ones with abusive parents wont be forced to. You're a pretty good example of why its needed so badly (sperm are not human lives). So tell me, oh so intelligent one, if sperm aren't human life, what are they? Elephant life? So you are for comprehensive sex ed in high schools?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","08:19 PM","abortion-debates","116"

I've read a lot of ignorant things said from anti-choicers, but this one takes the cake You've been reading too much religious propaganda. Time to open up a real biology book don't you think? Sperm is nothing more, and nothing less, than the male gamete or sex cell . They are the cells of an organism whose function it is to reproduce its kind. They, in and of themselves, are not 'life' as that process doesn't start to happen until after fertilization. Look up the term germ cells. Oh and just for the record, sperm are not just from humans as you ( cough ) suggested. According to your 'logic' if a man was to masturbate before he went to sleep - then he'd be awaken by a room full of babies the next morning Would make for a great scary movie I couldn't agree more, but I'm guessing it's too late for you ( unless you actually pick up a biology book and read it ).

Regardless, whom ever said it, it was ( literally ) a half truth and a misleading representation of the definition of the word life. You appear to assume a lot, which is why you are ignorant of the facts regarding this topic. BTW-that's not a slam on you. Your historic baseless posts on this topic confirm that you have never researched the facts regarding abortion. For the record I am personally against abortion, but at least ( unlike you ) I understand the actual biology behind it, and I would never force another human being to give up their right for freedom of choice , which is what this great country was founded on ! You are free to ignore the truth and live in your own little bubble, and I would be the first one supporting your right to do so, but it's a shame that one would waste their life based on half truths and lies when dealing with this topic. It doesn't serve you, it doesn't serve God, and it certainly doesn't serve your fellow human beings. Just know that whenever you or anyone else posts propaganda or rhetoric regarding this topic that I will be there to point it out. The only way to solve the issue of abortion is by sticking to, and understanding, the facts. Making things up as you go along helps no one. You get to have your own opinion, not your own private set of facts. You apparently can't engage in adult conversations with adults either. Facts are facts regardless of who states them. A 80 year old could tell you that the sun is hot and they'd be correct. A 8 year old could tell you the same thing and guess what? It would still be a fact. Weird huh? For the record I am an adult and you are the only one childishly running away. If you want to win in a debate, then first learn the facts of the topic.
