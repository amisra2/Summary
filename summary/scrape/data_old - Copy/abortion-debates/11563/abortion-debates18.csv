What about other MURDERER'S? Killing people in the commission of a crime is IMMORAL and we have laws to technically prevent that ... yeah ... not any time soon!","chester","324477","You place this: The LOSS of Freedom For The Sake Of Freedom IS NOT FREEDOM! as your tag, yet you are willing to sacrifice the freedom of women on the altar of their fetuses.

"09-21-2008","11563",18,"Galactababe","324453","Shooterandroud: First of all, I am not Catholic so the Pope is not my ""beloved"". Second of all, each of the medical conditions you cite are incidences of medical intervention designed to PROLONG LIFE. Pregnancy, except in a tiny minority of cases, is not a life threatening condition. It is in those minority of cases where the mother's life is in danger I support abortion, or where the woman's ability to control becoming pregnant was violated and eliminated due to rape.","Shooterandproud","324485","Of course you aren't. Doesn't matter, its ""unnatural"" to quote you. And lets say someone has a chronic pain condition. Not life threatening but still very painful.

Nor do they get pregnant from toilet seats or heavy petting or french kissing. They DO get pregnant when they allow an unprotected dick inside their bodies which ultimately dumps its, (according to the pro-choicers in this forum), painful, annoying, parasitic load inside them. You wanna get crude? I can beat you hands down.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","02:21 PM","abortion-debates","263"

People go to their favorite location and check out the model they want. and once in a while - someone goes in to a location and before they leave - they shoot the clerk and ANOTHER life is tossed away like some kind of scrap wrapping. HERE IS WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING: You people are full of tail wind ... most of you just want to argue about something you are too chicken to actually do! I bet your own mother's would slap the snot out of you if she thought you were going to abort of life from your womb... and others of you - this is probably the closest you have gotten to having sex with ANYTHING all month!","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","05:11 AM","abortion-debates","270"
