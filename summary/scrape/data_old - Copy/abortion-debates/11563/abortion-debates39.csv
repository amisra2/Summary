No one with any credibility pays much credence to your wild ramblings, but hey, why should any of the Pro-Choicers care. Like I said, you make the anti-choice movement look more and more delusional , so I guess thank you for that","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","12:12 AM","abortion-debates","571"

"10-17-2008","11563",39,"Colonel Ingus","328543","No, this is someone who pasted a link to youtube to show a clip from a medical show. Nothing more, nothing less. How you interpret something in your twisted mind is your own fault. We never said it was evidence as we already proved our point via medial references. I feel sorry for you gansao. You will grow up one day and become a very bitter and limited adult. Try and educate yourself with independent sources if you are interested in leading a full and truthful life. Just a suggestion","gansao","328626","Please provide academic qualifications of everyone who contributed to the video, how far they proceeded in their education, if they've written any papers, what their peers think of them as professionals. You posted a link to that video as EVIDENCE to your ridiculous belief of unborn babies = parasites. It appears that YOU have grown up to be maybe a bitter and certainly a limited adult so thank you for that warning Please dont feel sorry for me because I do not feel sorry for you , a little contempt maybe but sorry no","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","12:54 PM","abortion-debates","575"

"02-26-2009","11563",39,"charlie horse","322516","From a strictly 'argument' point of view, emotion shouldn't enter the picture. If pro-lifers/anti-abortionists looked at the issue dispassionately and rationally (difficult, I know), then they may well end up with a different viewpoint. How do we take the emotion out of argument?","Chuz Life","345181","That's the very challenge that keeps me engaged in these debates. I don't get the emotions anymore. I used to feel the panic that ""babies are being killed and I have to do something to save them"" until I realized that show of emotion just turned people away and I gained nothing by it. I still feel guilt when a day goes by and I didn't post something or try to reach someone somehow to debate the issue. But it's an emotion that I live with by knowing that I'm doing the best I can. Still, I have seen so many of the pictures, read so many rants and debates, etc... that I now see so many more of the aspects to the issue that thosed mired down in their emotions will often miss. Like the way elective abortion is used by predatory type men to victimize women. (Nicole Brown Simpson, Bonnie Blakely, refused to abort their babies and were subsequently murdered) So, when you say you would like to find a way to take the emotionalism out of it? Me too!","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:57 PM","abortion-debates","580"

Yes, PhotoShopped images are an effective tool for anti-choicers. Pregnant women are in the highest ranking for being killed, usually by someone they know. You could say that having an abortion could literally save their life But what do you care about saving lives of people already born? Children, infants and some certain animals make decisions through their emotions . Logical, rational, educated adults do not.

"02-28-2009","11563",39,"Archangel","328569","Blah, blah, blah... as usual, you offer nothing substantial as you lash out with your incoherent rant. If I'm so delusional ingus, and my reasoning so ignorant, then why can't a mental giant like you prove your assertion that Fetus/ZEF/Zygotes are TRUE PARASITES? You know why? Because they aren't. They are developing human beings. One of which you yourself was at one time just a few years ago. So stop lying as you make claims you can't prove. And don't you dare claim that your inability to support your irrational rants reflects badly on me. After all, I just looked at your profile. You've had 10 visits by 3 visitors, check mine out before declaring who has the most friends around HERE. Or who is respected the most.","Chuz Life","345415","I'm over trying to connect with Colonel Ignoramous on any kind of level. I've decided he will make a better foil for my views and opnions than he an adversary. You can feed into his trolling pap if you want,... but it's like tilting at windmills . (as far as I'm concerned) Foil; 4. a person or thing that makes another seem better by contrast: The straight man was an able foil to the comic. There are far more rewarding conversations to be had.

You can't debate with scientifically documented FACTS , so now all you've got in your anti-choicer bag of tricks is name calling. Children name call. Children also ' reason ' emotionally. Weird how that all works out for you huh? Care to display any other traits of a child?","Chuz Life","345450","""...aging begins at the time of conception . In fact, we age more during those nine months of gestation than at any other time during our entire life after we leave our mothers womb ."" -- The Lee Benner Institute ""Using the rate of change definition of aging, the rate of aging in mammals is most rapid during the fetal period when organisms develop from a single cell at conception to a multicellular organism containing trillions of cells at birth.""-- University of Wisconsin ""As soon as engine of life switches on at conception, the damage associated with aging begins to accumulate. It is inevitable, it is cumulative, and, at this point, it cannot be stopped or reversed."" --Jay Olshansky is a professor of public health at the University of Illinois at Chicago Tell me something, Colonel D. Ingus,... How can a human being's aging begin at conception; but their life does not?
