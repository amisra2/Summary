However, even if I didn't, you still run up against the point at which something is termed as 'human'.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","08:27 AM","abortion-debates","376"

If you reject that concept, then you reject human rights, hence your support for abortion.","chester","325262","Come back when you understand what the word ""Creator"" meant to the men, Jefferson especially, who wrote the Declaration. You might start with ""Deism.""","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","08:31 AM","abortion-debates","377"

You might start with ""Deism.""","Archangel","325266","I marvel at how important it is for the modern day atheists to define the founders personal religious beliefs as if that alone would have guided how they formed our Government regarding the liberties we enjoy and the part religion plays within that system of governing. It is undeniable that the founders never intended for Government to disallow people of faith to have an active voice in legislating or governing the people. That is an aberration of modern day atheists who have falsely and fraudulently injected that belief into the National psyche. What the founders were so serious about and intent on protecting the American people from was the unwanted imposition of some Government sponsored, endorsed, or required religion that the Federal Government mandated the people belong to or submit to. They rightfully understood that to force any religious beliefs on the people would represent the ultimate intrusion upon their thought life. So whether Jefferson was a deist or not made no difference at all to him when it came to representing and protecting the interests of the American people from the evils of a totalitarian form of Government. Which I believe our founders accomplished very well.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:04 AM","abortion-debates","378"

What's wrong with THIS SOLUTION ? ... you don't even have to be smart to do this!

What's so special about a person to make them superior to everything else? Should we start giving cats and dogs certain rights too? It all relies on some so called ""creator"" making us special. Which since I don't believe in any Creator the whole concept of human rights falls apart. There really shouldn't be any natural born rights there should only be earned rights. You don't earn your rights well...you obviously didn't want them badly enough. Don't start babbling about human brain and so on and so forth because their are other creatures that are equal and some are more so intelligent than our species. As well as being biologically more complicated its just that the human ego is massive >_> (Humans can destroy a planet thats more than a million times the species age ) The right to liberty, life and pursuit of happiness is nice on paper but isn't realistic. That's simply not the way the human race works.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","01:37 PM","abortion-debates","381"

"09-26-2008","11563",26,"Phyllis","325345","It obviously did not do just that. It articulated reasons why we were declaring independence. And the appeal was an appeal to moral right.","chester","325348","And what you seem to be unable to grasp is that a woman has a moral right not to be a slave to her fetus.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","05:05 PM","abortion-debates","386"
"09-26-2008","11563",26,"Phyllis","325356","1) It would not matter whether they recognized the fetus' right to life. My whole argument is that rights exist whether or not they are formally recognized and protected. This is why I can say that even when slavery was legal it was nevertheless wrong.","chester","325375","And yet you continue to support the illogic of a potential person having the right to make a slave of a person in being. Incredible. And, yes, if I am in a persistent vegetative state, I have authorized my family to direct my physicians to pull the plug. I'm not there.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","08:15 PM","abortion-debates","389"

Did that baby force her to conceive it? Is that baby the equivalent of a tumor as the pro abortionists claim them to be? NO, it is an unborn human being who just needs the time to grow and develop in order to be a sentient being just as we are as we type on these keyboards. That explains everything about how irrational you are! But based on your posts though, I think they already pulled the plug.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:03 PM","abortion-debates","390"
