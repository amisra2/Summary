"09-04-2008","11563",1,"iangb","322514","I have no issue with this, wrt abortion. What I have an issue with is that a fertilised egg cannot 'persue happiness', or enjoy any particular liberty - partly because it is still inside the mother, but largely because, as a mere minute collection of cells, it is not self-aware. What you have with a fertilised egg is not a 'man', but something that will eventually (possibly) become a 'man'.","charlie horse","322516","Part of the problem with the abortion issue goes with our perception of the value of animal life in general. We see a fly and swat it. We see a rat and set a dog on it. We see a cockroach and stamp on it. Pests. No problem. But when elephants trample villages, or other warm-blooded mammals become pests, there's an outcry about the destruction method. We don't see giant sledgehammers swatting elephants! - practicalities aside. Destruction has to be humane. And when it suits our purposes. It seems that cuddly, warm-blooded, embryo look-alikes get more emotional feeling than flies, cockroaches, mosquitos et al. From a strictly 'argument' point of view, emotion shouldn't enter the picture. If pro-lifers/anti-abortionists looked at the issue dispassionately and rationally (difficult, I know), then they may well end up with a different viewpoint. How do we take the emotion out of argument?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","12:22 PM","abortion-debates","4"

Here comes Palin, run for cover. Because I really fear ignorant and hypocritical conservatives. As to your argument, while were out calling fertilized eggs ""men"", lets call plant life ""men"" as well.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","07:17 PM","abortion-debates","6"
"09-04-2008","11563",1,"Galactababe","322535","Charlie horse: You can't. Why? Because emotions, by and large, are human characteristics. Bringing a new human life into the world is an emotional issue. Preventing that new human life from entering this world is an emotional issue. The condition of becoming pregnant is most often due to hormonally controlled emotions at the time of conception. Everything about the abortion issue is emotional. Deal with it.","Shooterandproud","322564","Everything about war is emotional too. Does that mean emotion should be factored into starting wars? People would be starting wars because another country ""hurt their feelings"", or we wouldn't go to war with threat country because ""what if someone dies""? You can be emotional whenever you want. Emotion should never be factored into making laws, especially laws that will cause emotional hardship for some people. Intellectual thought and rationality should be the basis for our legal system. Not ""emotions"".","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","07:20 PM","abortion-debates","7"
"09-05-2008","11563",1,"Galactababe","322641","Then by your reasoning, Roe vs. Wade should never have been brought to court and decided. Ok, I'll go with that.","Shooterandproud","322650","Is that so? Obviously every law has some emotion behind it, but it should be soley based on facts and logic. Do you disagree?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","09:47 AM","abortion-debates","9"

The only dogma free answer is the woman herself with or without the advice of her physician. And there's no such thing as an abortion lover. Talk about emotional.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","05:38 PM","abortion-debates","12"

Not a single one of the profetallifers here can explain why they believe that the government is better able to determine the future of a woman's pregnancy than she herself is. Why do they have such a deep distrust of a woman's ability to make decisions?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","05:41 PM","abortion-debates","13"
"09-05-2008","11563",1,"Galactababe","322718","Shooterandproud: Again with your inconsistent line of reasoning. First you insist: Then when I say, well, if that's the case, Roe vs. Wade should be overturned you reply with: Roe vs. Wade was a decidedly EMOTIONAL decision in favor of those who don't wish to endure the EMOTIONAL distress or inconvenience of carrying a pregnancy to term. You can't have it both ways.","Shooterandproud","322740","Yes, I can. Everything has emotion behind it, however basing something soley on emotion is stupid. Every law we make is because of emotions, however logic and reason are the primarily what are used when deciding to or not to enact a law. Making a law that says anyone who bullies another should be sent to a work camp and spend their lives there is based on emotion, however it is not logical. The law against murder however, is to deter more murders from happening and therefore stopping murders, preventing emotional distress. This is logical, because society would degrade if murder were legal. Making abortion illegal however, is based soley on emotion. Sure, seeing things that slightly resemble humans being killed can be emotionally disheartening, however when logic, reason, and science are used you will discover that these little creatures have no mental existence. Therefore, there is no reason for them to have rights, because mental existence is the basis for rights.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","06:40 PM","abortion-debates","14"
