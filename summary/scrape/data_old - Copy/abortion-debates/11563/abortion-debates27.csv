Yet one more ad hom. Do you have any idea how boring they have become? I think the correct Shakespeare quote is, ""It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:47 PM","abortion-debates","391"

What is incredible is that it is completely lost on you that you just called me an idiot.

You are the one who said that carrying a pregnancy to term was the PREFERRED choice, by which you suggest that there are other choices that you would approve of for women over and above your rape and incest exception. Welcome to the pro-choice side of the equation. Or maybe you were for abortion before you were against it. 2. You are the one who proposed a paltry fine of $2500 for the woman who obtains and $5000 for the doctor who performs an abortion. Not really sufficient sanction for ""ripping an unborn child from its mother"" is it now? Then again, cognitive dissonance coems easily to those who try to justify keeping a pregnant woman in slavery to her fetus. Sane folks shake their heads in wonder at just how irrational you can be.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","08:08 AM","abortion-debates","395"

If you wish, I'll even pay for the Geek Squad guy to come to your house and fix your ""Ignore"" button. And, yes, I would rather cavort with the Devil in Hell than spend eternity your version of Heaven. And Archie, please, PLEASE don't bother telling me where you think I'm going. Don't ever be so presumptuous as to think you know the mind of God.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","08:12 AM","abortion-debates","396"

Chester , poopsie, I've written this about 10x now, but your twisted little brain doesn't seem to remember what it has vomited onto your keyboard - One side of your mouth keeps calling the fines ""paltry"", and the other side claims if such fines are imposed, only the rich will be able to have abortions. The two statements are incompatible. Stop fighting with yourself and realize that you are a very confused old man who needs to take up bocci ball and put away the computer. The world will be a better place.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","06:00 PM","abortion-debates","397"

It doesn't mean that I'm going anywhere. Fear not yon sinner, your day will come. And you will rue the day you made this claim. As disgusting and repulsive as I find what you represent, I still mourn you for what awaits you.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","06:42 PM","abortion-debates","398"

I would no longer be. The only reason any of this will matter is if we believers in God and His promises are right, and the death of this body represents the beginning of eternal life, whether it be with Him, or apart from Him is our individual choices.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","10:22 PM","abortion-debates","400"

At least I have a chance at being right assuming your hypothetical is valid. Which it isn't, Because once again you either ignore, or forget about the assurance I have through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit which assures me of my place in the family of God. This isn't a cr*p shoot for me which is precisely what you are involved in regarding your eternal position.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","11:59 PM","abortion-debates","402"

If the true god is a just god and will accept those that have led a life of kindness towards others, then I've got no worries. You, on the other hand, have shown your true colours on this forum, and you're in for a nasty shock. As for your indwelling, you could just be a gullible twit who'll fall for anything.
