It is up to you to prove the non-existence of the soul to justify killing what you claim is only an embryo. Otherwise, nature should be allowed to take its course, which would either lead to a miscarriage, live birth or still birth.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","02:38 PM","abortion-debates","47"

Tradition? There's not one iota of evidence supporting the existence of such a non-physical entity. Shall we grant leprechauns and unicorns similar reality until disproven?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","03:40 PM","abortion-debates","49"
"09-09-2008","11563",4,"Galactababe","323106","Chester: You are simply desperate to lump me into your pro-abortion coven, aren't you? Sorry, ain't happening. Your group's usage of the word ""choice"" is much like Obama's usage of the word ""change"". Neither of you have exclusive rights to either word. If one side is pro-choice, then the other side must be anti-choice. Not so. If one side is pro-life, then the other must be anti-life. So? Or not so? CHOOSE life. CHANGE Roe vs. Wade .","sinjin","323115","Nothing in Roe prevents a woman from choosing to carry to term.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","03:43 PM","abortion-debates","50"

I think the choice to give life and carry it to term, regardless of how that life came to be (with the exception of rape victims) should become the preferred choice, because it is the right thing to do. Not because God says so, not because pro-lifers say so, but because we all need to be responsible for our actions. Reply With Quote Please note that you, not I, used the word choice twice in the same sentence. BTW, there is no such thing as a ""pro-abortion coven"".","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","03:47 PM","abortion-debates","51"

"09-09-2008","11563",4,"Shooterandproud","323161","Its called *drum roll please!* the brain! More specifically, a mental existence that comes with a brain. If I amputate a hand and keep it alive, does it have a soul? What about a leg? What about a head? If I amputated a head and kept it alive so that it could still talk, think, and feel, is that a person? Someone who is brain dead is legally dead. A mere arrangement of proteins is not what makes us humans unique. Heh, that's a good way of putting it.","chester","323179","You might want to ask archie and the other ""ensoulment"" folk here which twin gets the soul in the case of identical twins, or does each twin get half a soul?","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","11:00 PM","abortion-debates","59"
