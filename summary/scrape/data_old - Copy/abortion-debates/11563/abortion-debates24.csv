They will have taken away a person's ability to give birth by their own choice. That is a pretty significant freedom to have, imo. Certainly there are other factors involved, but what I have said here is also true.","gansao","325078","So telling you that you cannot steal and kill other people makes you a slave to the government!

I have never claimed that a fetus should have right to life because it has a soul! I also agree that there are cases where a fetus should be aborted! I just think that that the definition of a ' person with rights' should be rolled back as technology allows us to make that fetus viable! In ancient times a crippled baby would be left out to die, not because the ancient people were nasty b*stards but because only the strong survived! We live in a world where technology allows us to do things that we could not contemplate just a few years ago! If we can save a premature baby but are willing abort a fetus that is at the same stage or later then maybe we should take a long look at ourselves. Please excuse my bad writing, I am tired .","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","05:28 PM","abortion-debates","355"

Yes, laws prohibiting stealing limits the liberty of one person while protecting the liberty of another. In the end it is a wash. Slavery is so abhorrent not only just because of the loss of freedom, but the dominion over another person in pervasive and complete ways. Basic decisions such as: who I have babies with, do I have a baby now, do I give blood, am I an organ donor, do I eat now or later, what do I eat, when do I sleep and other decisions that seem more fundamentally personal are decided by an outside agency. This strips more than freedom away, it strips dignity and, in some sense, humanity away. This is where the comparison comes from. Perhaps it is wrong to draw a similarity between the complexity that was slavery to this more simple issue, but I think that the horror that many women view the necessarily draconian measures that would have to be put in place to effectively administer a complete moratorium on abortion to be similar in many important respects to slavery. I think it is. Currently there are many safe and effective measures to terminate pregnancy. These would have to be actively denied to pregnant woman who do not wish to be pregnant, effectively making it a requirement that pregnant women must continue their pregnancies by law. If those methods had never been available that might be a different thing.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","06:24 PM","abortion-debates","359"
"09-24-2008","11563",24,"Phyllis","325109","Not about being a being, bur rather whether as a being I have any inherent dignity and value that commands respect and protection. That is wholly metaphysical. Our unalienable rights today are the same as they have always been. The fact that they may not have been recognized or protected by the government does not mean they didn't exist; it just means that the government was not (and is not) fulfilling its ideal purpose. To clarify: human beings have always possessed the inherent right not to be slaves. However, many governments have not recognized and protected this inherent right. This means that governments were not/are not fulfilling their purpose, rather than that human beings do not inherently posses the right. Yes.","sinjin","325121","Firstly let me say I have always been impressed with the consistency and continuity of your positions as well as the style with which you defend them. I unfortunately cannot accept the inherency argument or that anything is thereby ""commanded"". That those rights have not been recognized or protected so often throughout history suggests to me that our rights are plenty ""alienable"". A gov't that affirms them and protects them is noteworthy but that does not confirm the inherency of those rights. The governments ""purpose"" hasn't always been to protect the rights of every person living under its control. See, I do know you.","watch-out-abortion-lovers-here-comes-governor-palin","06:40 PM","abortion-debates","360"
