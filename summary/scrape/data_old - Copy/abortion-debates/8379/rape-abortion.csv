An important thing to realize, is that you are a particular arrangement of particles of matter. Those particles of matter that make you up now, would have just been somewhere else, arranged differently as countless numbers of other things. That matter became you though, because your parents made it into you by using the facilities that their bodies naturally contain. When your mother was pregnant with you, the food she ate was processed by her body using chemicals in her digestive tract to render the materials needed to create a person, and then her reproductive system arranged it into you. Your argument seems to be that this matter became alive at the point of union between the sperm and egg. I dont believe that is necessarily the case, I dont think it becomes alive at a particular point, because the sperm and egg were alive already, as was much of the food that was eaten. But even if it is granted that that point is when it becomes alive, it was still potentially alive before that point but it was abandoned. abandoned by abstinence, by masturbation, by menstruation, or by deciding to eat one thing instead of the other. And finally, returning to my original point: regardless of when matter becomes life, all matter is potential life and is constantly not given the chance to live. Whether a bunch of matter is arranged into a fetus, given life and abandoned before birth, or never arranged at all, it is never given a chance to live just the same. So whats the big deal about conception?","rape-abortion","12:19 AM","abortion-debates","19"

It's only when this abortion thing came on that they changed their wording to make sure it didn't remind them of the true facts. Pro-choice, Pro-abortion, I've never seen anything that makes the choice better than than the abortion. Besides, you should really consider your position. If you are, in fact, pro-choice, and at the same time believe that a fetus is a baby, then how does your moral code work? A baby is being murdered, if I understand you're statement correctly, but you will allow that to happen in case somebody wants to do it? That doesn't seem very sound to me. It's my experience that a person labels themselves pro-choice because the connotations are consideration, allowance for other's freedoms and the respect of social liberties. There are only two sides to the abortion issue, and the pro-choicers know that. They use the term as a shield, not as a definition of sides. You see, those with a moral code who wish to compromise for abortion will not call themselves pro-abortionists because the name says pretty blatantly that they are in favor of allowing babies to be killed (regardless of whether they think a fetus is a baby or not) and they know that looks bad to other people. That's one of the reasons the media almost never uses the term pro-abortionist. So what if he/she can't exercise their right to live? I've never seen or heard of a baby who was just born sueing their parents because they decided to leave him on the sidewalk in the slums since they didn't want to take care of him. A 3 yr. old can't exercise the right to live anymore than a 2 yr. old, a 1 yr. old or a six week old. You couldn't have exercised you're right to live when you were 5 or 6 either. You still needed support and help and care.

Stealing was a common way to obtain a horse in many early indian tribes her in america. It was not considered wrong, nor was the stealer deemed a theif. It was just bad luck for the person who had the horse originally. -- The Bible was the foundation for the laws prohibiting stealing for any reason. Murder and killing are two different things. In america, killing in any case is considered murder (Except self-defense). Killing for revenge is considered a right in some places, and even in the Israelite law it stated that killing for revenge was an alloted right. But they aren't allowed period now, and each one is considered murder. -- Killing is a sin, and was recognized as such when the first American laws were written. How about the way Justice is served in America? How our system allows any man to speak in a trial even if he is suspected? And things like Freedom of Speech? That isn't allowed in many countries, but look here, in the same Bible the made those other two laws. Deuteronomy 1:16-17 Look it up. I'm still not sure what the sanctity of life means yet. I've heard the term, but I don't know what it means. I'll study it later. But I do believe that God made life, including the feti, the babies and the children and the adults.

They have a better support system in place, whether they have an abortion or choose to remain pregnant. 3.

You've also said nothing about my reply to your ""you've made your bed, now sleep in it comment"". I said that that comment certainly sounds like you're making being a mother punishment for having sex. Is that how you feel? Should women be punished for having sex by being forced into motherhood, whether it be for nine months or the rest of her life? This is not showing care for the child. Mothers who are forced into pregancy are not going to show the best care for their child, and ultimately, the child will suffer. How are you going to address this? It's really easy to make abstract claims like ""People have tried to separate sex from pregnancy and eliminate any responsibility involved"" so abortion should be illegal but when faced with reality you might find that your concrete line is now a little dotted. Yes it is killing a developing life. Yes, it is a horrible procedure. What solutions do you have to make the need for abortion be eliminated? In response to your ""personal responsibility"" comment, sometimes an abortion is taking personal responsibility. Why does taking responsibility only mean continuing a pregnancy to birth? Because that's what you think is morally correct? Do you also think, based upon your above example, that people who smoke should be denied health care for their smoke-related health issues, because that's taking personal responsibility?

Then, you say this again: And georged said, which I happen to want to reiterate, A. Guilt is not a given emotion you have to life with. B. No one ""kills their child"" for their own sexual convenience. People have abortions for many reasons. It is complex and varied. I suggest you read up on it. And before you give me the ""I have, and here's some pro-life churchy sites where you can read up on it to"" let me remind you that I have had an abortion and actually know and understand the reasons why women have them, and it's not about sexual freedom. Again, another anti-choicer who does not care about the fetuses/babies/children. Not your problem anymore, now that you've forced pregnancy and mandated childbirth upon pregnant women! You can breathe a sigh of relief. All those unwanted children will be born, and their mothers will still have problems which will filter down negatively into the child's life, but that's not your issue anymore. Tough luck, kids. At any rate, since you've had sex, I hope that you are prepared for parenting! Because everyone who has sex, including 14 year olds, married couples with children already, married couples without children, people who enjoy sex for emotional bonding, people who's birth control fails, etc. are clearly obligated to be parents whether it be for nine months or eighteen years. Duh. Those doggone lawyers! They are always making up stuff. Clearly, every woman who has an unwanted pregnancy has no mental health issues regarding it. They are of sound mind and are fully able, mentally and physically, to carry a fetus to term. After all, they had sex. Clearly, they must suffer through the actions of that! It's a good kind of punishment, you see, you made your bed, now sleep in it! I bet that'll teach those women who have sex and aren't prepared to be a parent.

You realize that some have abortions for what they believe are good, honest reasons. This is excellent! I am glad that you, although you disagree with abortion, and (correct me if I'm wrong) you don't think these are good reasons, you do understand that these other people do . I am thrilled!!! Seriously, I'm not kidding. I think that this is a big deal and perhaps you are starting to feel some kind of compassion for women who are facing unwanted pregnancies and looking for abortions. Good for you! [It's too bad that you go on to say the last bit I've quoted down below here.] As far as sexual convenience goes, I am sure that there are some women who have abortions as a form of birth control. I think this is terrible. I still do not think they should be ""forced"" to remain pregnant as a type of punishment for their behavior, but I do think that they should be strongly encouraged to be on some kind of birth control. However, how do you weed these women out? How do you identify them, and do you have any stats on this? I have not personally come across any woman who has multiple abortions who do so as a form of birth control. Abortion is a HUGE, mind racking, large, looming, & momentous decision, and I do not believe many women have them as a form of birth control for their own sexual convenience. Of course, I don't know what exactly you mean by ""sexual convenience"". Do you think that women who have abortions for ""sexual convenience"" are the majority? [QUOTE]I did not force them to have sex, I did not push them into the rush hour traffic to get hit by a car, I did not help it along. ... You're trying to shift the burden of responsibility of the pregnancy from the back of the whiny complainy people who are stuck where they are onto the back of those who are trying to make them live with their own actions and take personal responsbility. [/QUOUT] This is exactly the problem. You want to outlaw abortion, and then wash your hands of the problems the little babies will face because of it. The problems will still exist! People will still suffer! You cannot take choices away from them and then forget about it. And I say again, why does taking ""personal responsibility"" only mean carrying the child to term? It doesn't. It does to you, because that's what's right to you. But for others, taking responsibility means not bringing another unwanted child into the world. They do have to care for it, in your mandated pregnancy and forced childbirth world. They do have to, and they don't have a choice. It will effect the child negatively. Do you think women who are going through an unwanted pregnancy are going to be the best pregnant woman they can be for their child? Do you think they'll spend $ (if they even have it) to go to the doctor, eat right, not take drugs, smoke, drink, etc. How come no one ever addresses this when I bring it up? It's glossed over completely. Not your problem, huh? As long as they have the kid, who cares? I am glad that there are couples you know that have adopted children. I hope they inspire many people to do the same. No you don't care for the kids. You just pushed them all aside when you said, to paraphrase, ""I didn't do it so it's not my problem"" and washed yourself clean of 'blame' for their existence. I have not heard one single idea from you about how you are going to help these kids. I'm not just talking adoption here, either. How are you going to get little crack babies adopted, kids with disabilities, kids of minorities, the kids whose mothers decide to keep even though they are ill prepared to mother them either emotionally, physically, or financially, etc. Yes, I think everyone should have a very serious view on sex. Actually, I think many people should be sterilized. Like my next door neighbor, who just has a severe 'domestic violence' incident with his girlfriend who puts up with it. I think he should be sterilized and then beat with large iron rods so he knows what it's like. Yes, true. Allowed? Huh? Are you saying that, for example, married couples using birth control shouldn't be ""allowed"" to have sex unless they are prepared to be parents? 14 year olds who have sex are obligated to be parents, whether for nine months or eighteen years? Right, punish those women by forcing them to bear children! Right on! That's what's best for women, their children, the fetuses, the fathers, and society. What a great way of thinking!! Excellent!!

I think it is a fair comparison if you are talking about sexual behavior. This kind of thing is what you do in arguments, rather than making claims and not backing them up.

Plasma adrenalin, noradrenaline, glucagon, aldosterone, corticosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, and 11-deoxycortisol levels, however, were significantly elevated in the non-fentanyl group up to 24 hours after surgery. Reduced hormonal response was viewed as responsible for the improved clinical outcome of the fentanyl group, which required less post-surgical ventilatory support and had reduced circulatory and metabolic complications. Anand and Hickey (1992) advanced these findings in a subsequent report indicating that neonates receiving deep anesthesia during surgery had improved post-operative morbidity compared with neonates receiving lighter anesthesia. The reduced hormonal response and improved clinical outcome following invasive surgeryin conjunction with anesthetics used for pain relief in adultsled to the conclusion that neonates could feel pain and that this pain needed to be controlled (Rogers, 1992). Further support comes from the work of Fitzgerald (1987, 1994), who has reviewed the biological development of the fetus and examined the possibility of fetal pain at each stage of development. At 7.5 weeks gestation, reflex responses to somatic stimuli begin, and touching the perioral region results in a contralateral bending of the head. The palms of the hands become sensitive to stroking at 10.5 weeks, and the rest of the body and hindlimbs become sensitive at approximately 13.5 weeks. Shortly after the development of sensitivity, repeated skin stimulation results in hyperexcitability and a generalized movement of all limbs. This hyperexcitability has been interpreted as evidence for the presence of a functional pain system, reflecting an immature but intact pain response with early hypersensitivity to stimulation (Barr, 1994). This view is not widely accepted, however, and is rejected by Fitzgerald herself. Prior to 26 weeks, the thalamocortical fibers have not yet penetrated the cortical plate, and it seems unlikely the cortical structures considered necessary for pain are responding to noxious stimulation (Mrzljak, Uylings, Kostovic, & van Eden, 1988). The evidence for cortical involvement post-26 weeks is enhanced by behavioral studies that have demonstrated focused and organized responses to noxious stimulation that can be better discriminated from other distress responses (Craig, Whitfield, Grunau, Linton, & Hadjistavropoulos, 1993). As with the hormonal response to surgery, the behavioral responses can be reduced with the use of appropriate anesthetic (Fitzgerald, Millard, & McIntosh, 1989). Having established the necessary neurobiology for pain is in place and that behavioral responses to noxious stimulation are present in premature babies of approximately 26 weeks gestation, it is logical to suggest a fetus of at least 26 weeks gestation will respond similarly to invasive practice as observed in neonates undergoing surgery. Giannakoulopoulos et al. (1994) from the Queen Charlottes Hospital in London, England, successfully demonstrated intrauterine needling to obtain blood samples from fetuses at 20 to 34 weeks gestation results in a hormonal stress response. They demonstrated that needling the innervated intraabdominal portion of the umbilical vein, rather than the placental cord (which is not innervated) resulted in increased cortisol and b-endorphin concentrations in fetal plasma. If this group or others can demonstrate the hormonal and neural stress response can be prevented with the use of appropriate anesthetics, they will have mirrored the criteria that have led to the widespread acceptance of neonatal pain. Evidence Against An Experience of Pain The undisputed discovery that the neonate and fetus launch a hormonal and neural response to invasive practice cannot be considered proof there is an experience of pain. An experience implies sensations have been interpreted in a conscious manner. Even when combined with the observations of behavior and improved clinical outcome when using anesthetics, there is still no proof there is an experience of pain. Although all of these phenomena are associated with the notion of pain, none of them adequately describe or explain the phenomenological experience of pain. These phenomena may exist independently of conscious experience. The relationship between the physiological responses of nociceptors, the hormonal and other responses of the CNS, and the behavioral outcome of these changes to the psychological response are yet to be determined (Wall & McMahon, 1986). If a proper assessment of neonatal and fetal pain is to be undertaken, we should examine the structure of the psychological experience of pain, as the biological structures have been examined, and then work backwards to the fetus and neonate to decide whether it is likely or possible these psychological structures are in place (Derbyshire, 1999). Pain experience is now widely seen as a consequence of an amalgam of cognition, sensation, and affective processes, commonly described under the rubric of the biopsychosocial model of pain. Pain is no longer regarded as merely a physical sensation of noxious stimulus and disease, but is seen as a conscious experience that may be modulated by mental, emotional, and sensory mechanisms with sensory and emotional components. The biopsychosocial concept emphasizes the multidimensional nature of illness, injury, and pain, rather than emphasizing pain as a purely physical fact of illness or injury. Pain has been described as a multidimensional phenomena for some time (Melzack & Casey, 1968), and this understanding is reflected in the current IASP definition of pain as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage (Merskey, 1991). If this multidimensionality is the basis of conscious pain experience, it seems unlikely we can attribute this experience to the neonate or unborn fetus, which is naive to the cognitive, affective, and evaluative experiences necessary for pain awareness. This is accepted in the current definition of pain, which is further expanded to state, Pain is always subjective. Each individual learns the application of the word through experiences related to injury in early life. Pain does not, so to speak, spring forth from the depths of the persons mind prior to any experience, but is gradually formed as a consequence of general conscious development. Interestingly, even those authors who support a concept of fetal pain tend to back away when confronted with the need to explain pain phenomenology. Giannakoulopoulos et al (1994), for example, distanced themselves from any implied fetal pain experience with the statement, a hormonal response cannot be equated with the perception of pain. Lloyd-Thomas and Fitzgerald (1996) have suggested if feeling and pain are properly understood, the fetus cannot be said to feel pain. A further reason to doubt the viability of fetal pain post-26 weeks gestation is the development of the fetal cortex. Although the thalamocortical fibers penetrate the cortical plate at approximately 26 weeks gestation, the cortical regions that have been identified as important in processing the various components of pain (Derbyshire, 2000) do not become fully responsive until after birth (Chugani & Even a newborn has a basic interest in it's future.It looks towards feedings and bonding with mom.Not to mention a newborn is sentient and is a seperate individule proected by law. Even so,when there is a conflict of interest (mother vs fetus) one of them is going to lose out.In this case I put the already born sentient person before the non-born non-sentient fetus.You can not be equal in this situation,one is going to be valued more than the other.Seeing that forced pregnancy for rape is your solution you but the value of the fetus before the mother PERIOD.","rape-abortion","04:00 PM","abortion-debates","181"
