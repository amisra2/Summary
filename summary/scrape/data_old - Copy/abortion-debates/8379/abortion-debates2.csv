When she eats half an apple and throws the other half away, she has decided to let half of the matter that apple was composed of to possibly become part of a living human being, and to let the other half become part of a landfill. So anything that could be used by a womans body to create a child is a potential child. This is especaly the case for sperm, witch is constructed by a mans body for the spesific purpose of contributing to the creation of a person. a mans body creates more sperm then could ever be used though, unless it was all saved and artficaly inseminated. none of the matter in the world can become a living thing without being helped along by a man and a woman. every man and woman starts this process with some matter, creating living things, sperm and eggs, die off because the process is not continued, they are abandoned. so, what justification is there to say that a sperm and egg are not a person or potential person, while they are speperate, but become one once they are merged?","rape-abortion","11:54 PM","abortion-debates","17"

An important thing to realize, is that you are a particular arrangement of particles of matter. Those particles of matter that make you up now, would have just been somewhere else, arranged differently as countless numbers of other things. That matter became you though, because your parents made it into you by using the facilities that their bodies naturally contain. When your mother was pregnant with you, the food she ate was processed by her body using chemicals in her digestive tract to render the materials needed to create a person, and then her reproductive system arranged it into you. Your argument seems to be that this matter became alive at the point of union between the sperm and egg. I dont believe that is necessarily the case, I dont think it becomes alive at a particular point, because the sperm and egg were alive already, as was much of the food that was eaten. But even if it is granted that that point is when it becomes alive, it was still potentially alive before that point but it was abandoned. abandoned by abstinence, by masturbation, by menstruation, or by deciding to eat one thing instead of the other. And finally, returning to my original point: regardless of when matter becomes life, all matter is potential life and is constantly not given the chance to live. Whether a bunch of matter is arranged into a fetus, given life and abandoned before birth, or never arranged at all, it is never given a chance to live just the same. So whats the big deal about conception?","rape-abortion","12:19 AM","abortion-debates","19"

You meet and befriend someone and later find out that she is a grown ""child of rape."" Someone begins a discussion of abortion while both of you are present. How would you word your position when discussing it with her?","Bell","219155","I would say something along the honest lines of...""I advocate choice"" but only if my input was directly asked after.

"06-28-2006","8379",2,"None","None","None","Prototype","219661","Throwing away, killing or eliminating anything consisting of human DNA is not wrong. A child is being developed in the womb, but it is not being put together piece by piece as the mother eats and drinks. It's already there, it is simply growing. A pro-life person shouldn't argue that a fetus is a baby simply because it has human DNA. It makes more sense to argue that there is a living growing baby in the mother's womb that can be killed. I can remove my appendix from my body, but it isn't a sin because of having human DNA. A fetus is not just a chunk of DNA, it is a living baby.","rape-abortion","12:05 PM","abortion-debates","26"

A fetus is a general term for the age of an eight week old baby. Though personally, I suspect it is used by many pro-abortionists as a way to avoid saying outright that abortion is the killing of a baby. Obviously since killing a baby is against the law, they've tried to twist it around to soothe their own consciences.","rape-abortion","07:37 PM","abortion-debates","28"
"06-28-2006","8379",2,"None","None","None","GodIsDead","219815","if a fetus was the same thing, then why would it be eazyer to use that term? i would think that the reason is that the word fetus calls to mind the image of an undeveloped thing (accurately) while baby calls to mind a eight month old in a stroller. If useing the word fetus is eazyer because it calls to mind a more appropreate image, then whats wrong with that?","rape-abortion","08:41 PM","abortion-debates","29"
"06-29-2006","8379",2,"None","None","None","Prototype","219934","Pro-abortionists do not use the term fetus to be scientifically accurate. It's as clear as crystal that they use it to soothe their own consciences and to avoid the truth. Obviously the meaning has been altered in the abortion debate because if a pro-abortionist admited that the thing being aborted was a baby, they would have to admit that murder was being commited. That's why there are these squabbles over whether a fetus is a person or not. Pro-abortionists force themselves into this shell of belief to shield themselves from the truth that a baby is a person with the right to live. If they came out of there, they'd be left with no alternative to admitting that an un-born baby was just as worthy to live as any other human being. That's all the pro-abortionists have to fall back on really, and it's ridiculous how they'll go on about it.","rape-abortion","03:38 PM","abortion-debates","30"
