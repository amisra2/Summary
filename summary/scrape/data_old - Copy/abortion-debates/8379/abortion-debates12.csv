"07-28-2006","8379",12,"jitobear","None","Ah, look - another ifer who thinks they will help women have sucessful pregnancies by calling any curcumstance in their life besides their impending death ""stupid"". On top of that another with the illusion the we go from conception to birth like its cheap and easy peasy. I also refuse to swallow the ""responsibility"" argument from an individual who expects the same responsibility from those he terms ""stupid"" and a rape victim. Anyone who believes they have the right to hi-jack the life, financials, and health of a rape victim for the better part of year is little better than an ally to rapists - but that's just my opinion - and of course you wanted to hear it.","Evan","225124","I think Prototype cleared things up very nicely. I would just like to say that in the unlikely situation (.6%) when a women has become pregnant due to rape that they should still not have the abortion, because as i said you should not punish the child because of the sins of their father, you should punish the father swiftly and harshly. Rape is a terrible thing, and it i understand that those 9months will be very rough, but thats no reason to end the life of a human being. They should have the child, they should sue the paints of the rapist and force him to pay for all expenses, and then if they do not want the child then they should put it up for adoption.","rape-abortion","01:03 PM","abortion-debates","168"
"07-28-2006","8379",12,"None","None","None","jitobear","225132","Proto and Evan - The reason I consider those who would mandate pregnancy for an impregnated rape victim allies to rapists is because you would do the SAME THING. Rape is a violation - someone using your body against your consent. A rapist does it breifly - you ask to do for the better part of a year. I have been raped and I will tell you what - revenge never crossed my mind. Not once. Personal safety and getting my life back were paramount. A woman's life is not null and void at the moment of any conception and she is most certainly not responsible for a pregnancy she did not consent to. It has nothing to do with punishing anyone. Contrary to what you seem to presume about the lives of women - they have bodies, health concern, jobs, families, responsibilities, personal finances, and a miriad of complications that she should not have to put on the line for one nonosecond due to a rape. And Evan, your suggestion that she should have to go through the expense of a trial to get funding from her rapist to pay for her pregnancy and then consider whether she raise a child with him? I am now convinced you are a first class woman-hater. Pray have no daughters. Ultimately you still hold rape victims as accountable as those you term ""stupid"" so you have yet to convince me that your stance has a thing to do with responsibility. It does not. It has to do with your low estimation of women. For you trivialize every circumstance in a woman's life. And as easy as it is for you to disregard the circumstances of her life - she can not and will not and will do as she must. As an example - any pregnancy that is a threat to my health, life or livlihood (I provide for an already born child) or was the result of a rape will be ended - and any law on the books be damned.","rape-abortion","01:47 PM","abortion-debates","169"

But a childs life is no more meaningless then your own. A CHILDS LIFE SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED, a child has a body, health concerns, and should not be deemed any less significant then yours. A childs life is not null and void because of the horrible actions of their biological father. Ouch... i don't think you know what your talking about. I never once suggested that you consider raising the child with him.. heck if i had my way you wouldn't be able to because he'd be dead. I love women, and i have much sympathy for you and others that have gone through what you have. But i also love children, and by no means, in no circumstance should their lives be ended by another NO.... you don't understand. won't someone please think about the children!!! I understand that what you've gone through is horrible, and I do not consider others who have gone through it and have gotten pregnant stupid at all!!! However, LIFE IS MORE IMPORTANT!!! you should not kill another just because it has inconvenienced you. I'm sorry to all women that have been raped, and i hold women in very high regard and i respect them very much. BUT I VALUE LIFE, CONSIDERBLE, especially that of a childs. It happened, and im sorry, but do not, i repeat DO NOT sentence the child to death!!!","rape-abortion","02:13 PM","abortion-debates","170"

Sex is not something that you should be doing with every single person your infatuated with. People need to be more responsible and need to get back to traditional family values. It blows my mind that you wouldn't encourage young women not to have sex, it could destroy their lifes. they could get an STD, or pregnate. young people don't think about these things and just jump in because theres to many people like you telling them either you don't care, or theirs nothing wrong with it. We have more money being spent on a cure for AID's then Cancer. Thats unbelievable. heres a thought, don't sleep around and you won't get AID's!!! theres an easy solution, just take to responsiblity.","rape-abortion","02:23 PM","abortion-debates","172"

I'm not sure on the technicol names for everything, but basically they poke the fetus with this pin like tool, and the fetus flinchs. then they remove the tool. after alittle bit they place the tool and slowly move it closer to the fetus, and the fetus moves away from it. It remembers the pain, and shows a diswant for it. Is it possible to have diswants and at the sametime not able to have wants? I don't think so, just because the fetus is eaquiped with everything it desires already does not mean it still does not desire them. And does a new born have a interest in it's future? No, its not the much different from a fetus in the way it acts. so why not just kill babies if they become to hard to handle and the mother feels that they made a bad choice having it? No i didn't lol. I love how some of you twist and spin things. I feel that an unborn child is still a child, and is still a human being. I never once, not once said that this childs life is more improtant then the life of an actual existing person. I implied that it is just as important, its equal.","rape-abortion","03:25 PM","abortion-debates","180"
