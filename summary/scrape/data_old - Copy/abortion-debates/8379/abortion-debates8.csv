Even if you win, you're still retarted.""","sinjin","222256","Has it occured to you how offensive that might be to a parent of a special needs child? Nevermind the fact that you have no disability to account for your inability to spell argument or retarded.","rape-abortion","04:29 PM","abortion-debates","106"
"07-13-2006","8379",8,"wallninja","None","Something that is always brought up in these arguements is the whole difference between a fetus and a baby. Let's look at the basics. Type define: fetus into a google search. You will notice that every definition has ""unborn baby"" or ""unborn child"" or something along those lines which shows that the fetus is in fact the a baby. Also, the word fetus comes from Latin where the meaning is ""offspring"" or ""young"". I have a Latin dictionary in my lap right now if anyone really want's to argue about it with me and tell me I'm wrong. Using common sense and a dictionary a human fetus is literally defined as human offspring or a young human.","thelmoose","222261","Beyond the fact that a dictionary only answers lexical questions, you seem to have overlooked the operative word there, ""unborn"". That's quite different than ""born"". I, too, am not clear on your point. I also think your tag line is offensive and ironically misspelled.","rape-abortion","05:10 PM","abortion-debates","107"

Yep - sex sex should only be allowed to middle class Christians with stay at home wives! (Even though they probably SUCK at it!!!) bwaaaaahahha haaaaa","rape-abortion","04:43 PM","abortion-debates","108"
"07-20-2006","8379",8,"None","None","None","Prototype","223694","Does this mean that you should be allowed to abort a baby just so you can enjoy sex?","rape-abortion","05:00 PM","abortion-debates","109"
"07-20-2006","8379",8,"Prototype","None","Does this mean that you should be allowed to abort a baby just so you can enjoy sex?","jitobear","223697","Tubes are tied. And yes you should be able to enjoy sex. And you should also be able to end a pregnancy that will be detrimental. And one would hope that folks use preventative measures - but, you know, birth control fails, people are raped, life circumstances change - and on occasion some people are stupidly irresponsible - but you are a fool if you think forced pregnancy will fix that.","rape-abortion","05:09 PM","abortion-debates","110"
"07-20-2006","8379",8,"None","None","None","Prototype","223721","Forced pregnancy will not fix it. It will not fix rape, incest or other causes. But when women start realizing they can't jump out of being responsible for their sex life, they will start having sex less. Even if it doesn't work completely, it will decrease the amount of abortions some. Oh, and killing a baby so you can enjoy sex is purely selfish. It is nothing less than murder. It shows off inhumane people will go because they are so desperate for sex. Sex is pleasurable, but it was created first and foremost for sustaining human life. You can't (unless tubes are tied) just have sex and kill willy-nilly.","rape-abortion","07:32 PM","abortion-debates","111"
"07-20-2006","8379",8,"thelmoose","None","This has no basis in fact. I don't know what forced pregnancy means. If you mean making abortions illegal, it will reduce the number of abortions somewhat, I predict. But, like most prohibition, it will not have much effect and illegal abortions and their consequences will proliferate. Abortion is not baby killing. Stop saying that. Using silly sensational language indicates a lack of a thoughtful argument. This paragraph demonstrates little understanding of sexual drive and sexual behavior. Also, no one is having abortions ""willy-nilly.""","Prototype","223732","It would help though. Murder and rape are illegal, and people still commit those crimes. It obviously helps to keep those crimes illegal, it would lower the numbers, Abortion is baby killing to me, and I'll use the wording I prefer. I'm to look at a person willing to kill a baby just to have sex and try to be understanding?!? And I did not say people have abortions willy-nilly. People want to have sex willy-nilly, so they'll go to extents like abortion to get it without extra burdens. There are people like that, a lot of people in fact.","rape-abortion","09:40 PM","abortion-debates","113"

What do you think about prohibition and how that affected alcohol consumption? As well as the other crimes that were associated with it?","rape-abortion","09:54 PM","abortion-debates","114"

Having children is selfish BTW.(from an evolutionary standoint). The rest of your post is pure overly emotional rhetoric.I highly doubt anyone who is seeking an abortion would even take you moral opinion of them seriously.","rape-abortion","07:58 AM","abortion-debates","117"
"07-21-2006","8379",8,"maximus","None","If you hold the position of allowing abortion in the cases of rape and incest please answer the following. You meet and befriend someone and later find out that she is a grown ""child of rape."" Someone begins a discussion of abortion while both of you are present. How would you word your position when discussing it with her?","doG","223793","I would tell her that I was glad her mother chose to have her. It would still not make me think that raped women should be forced to carry a pregnancy they did not want or willingly particpate in creating.","rape-abortion","08:03 AM","abortion-debates","118"
"07-21-2006","8379",8,"Steeeeve","None","because one existed and one didn't. You can't kill something that doesn't exist...this isn't rocket science","happygrl35","223798","You can't Murder (abort) a person who doesn't exists","rape-abortion","08:19 AM","abortion-debates","119"
"07-21-2006","8379",8,"Steeeeve","None","Because that is how a new life is created. New set of human DNA (different from mothers) kind of makes this point. The fact that something is feeding off of you does not make it part of you. I would never call a leech part of me if it were to sucking my blood to live.","happygrl35","223800","So life is only valuable when it has it's own unique DNA? So if I save a little living DNA from my aborted fetus is it not murder then? ALL DNA has the potential become human beings,ever hear of cloning? So how do you come to the conclusion that an egg or sperm is less valuable then a zygote?","rape-abortion","08:26 AM","abortion-debates","120"
