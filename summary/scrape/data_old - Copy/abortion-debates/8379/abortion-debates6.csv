"07-03-2006","8379",6,"zachvac","None","The problem here is that a fetus cannot develop on its own, it needs the mother. I believe you use a very similar argument to that of those who argue life begins at birth. At birth it truly can survive without the mother, beforehand it can't.","Prototype","220602","I have a six year old little sister that couldn't survive on her own any better than a new born. Well, she would live longer than a newborn would, but left alone, she will also die. Every human ever born was dependant on someone else to help them through the earliest stages of life. And if a woman does not wish to support a child, she should not do thinds that risk getting pregnant.","rape-abortion","11:00 AM","abortion-debates","76"
"07-03-2006","8379",6,"zachvac","None","Sorry I wasn't clear, say a girl was raped. Would you be ok with her using the morning after pill?","DrNo","220604","Yes. Any woman that is raped should have abortion as an option. She didn't engage in consentual sex.","rape-abortion","11:08 AM","abortion-debates","77"
"07-03-2006","8379",6,"Prototype","None","-- The Bible was the foundation for the laws prohibiting stealing for any reason.","georged","220605","Sad news, but punishment for taking possessions or a life without permission was a law of the land and formal societal decisions long before your bible came about. Your intellectualism is limited by tunnel vision relating to your belief system.","rape-abortion","11:09 AM","abortion-debates","78"

She is unable to verbalize anything. She cannot communicate in sentences? She cannot tell someone, ""I'm hungry, I'm cold.

A baby does not become a completely independant child needless of his/her mother's care. Sure, my litttle sister can say those things verbally, but so can a newborn. Hungry ""WAAAH!!!"" Cold ""WAAAH!!!"" SLEEPY ""WAAAH!!!"" UNCOMFORTABLE OR AFRAID ""WAAAH!"" It goes on, but I'm sure you get the idea. Communication doesn't make any difference to me in an abortion. A person in a coma can't complain when someone takes out their feeding tube either. That doesn't mean it wasn't a wrong thing to do.","rape-abortion","02:40 PM","abortion-debates","81"

"07-03-2006","8379",6,"Bell","None","Sometimes, taking personal responsibility for your actions includes making the decision to have an abortion. Whether or not you agree with it does not change the fact that it's a form of taking responsibility. So people should only have sex if they are ready to bring a child into the world? You're one of those, huh? I bet you have not had sex yet, either.","DrNo","220680","This isn't a competition, so it will suffice for me to say that I have had sex. I am not denying that sex is enjoyable. Duh. All I am saying is that people need to understand the consequences of sex and they should be prepared to deal with them. When one of the consequences of your actions is the creation of a new life, I don't think eliminating that life should be a viable option.

For the sake of argument, the only way to realistically enforce such a ban would be sterilization of the male of the species while utilizing a sperm bank for reproduction purposes. Using China as a failed example of enforced criminal control of human reproduction based on a voluntary basis, we know that doesn't work. How would you proceed to eliminate abortion in all US states other than using federal legislation denying states rights? I'm also curious as to how you propose caring for those consequences of emotion by outlawing abortion, a political action driven by moral belief not subscribed to by all citizens? Maybe Alabama as a federal orphanage?","rape-abortion","07:46 PM","abortion-debates","86"

If abortion is made illegal, then the burden of those pregnancies rests with those who got pregnant by themselves, not those who stopped them from commiting murder. Oh, and by the way, America did not create the legalization of abortion with the subscription of all citizens. There were those who opposed it, but that didn't make a difference. And there were also those who were driven to legalize it for moral reasons of their own. They're no less guilty than pro-lifers are. Yet, you don't seem to have a problem with that. That's because you yourself couldn't survive without morals of SOME kind, you just don't want to admit it. You just like to blacken the names of others who actually do when it hurts you.","rape-abortion","08:05 PM","abortion-debates","87"

You don't know what you're talking about. Belief system dogma and literacy plays the most crucial part in the culture of every tribe/nation/union in the world. From the beginning, not just spontaneous, out of the blue occurences. Oh, by the way, Criminal laws are based on morals. Look at my example of stealing horses! We didn't develop these laws because it rubbed the victim of the robbery the wrong way, we did it because the Bible stated that stealing is an absolute sin, and our founding fathers believed it and established our law that way. Criminal laws not based on morals?! Come on here, you sound almost like you've lived in a cave all your life.","rape-abortion","08:13 PM","abortion-debates","88"

I don't waste my time in fruitless exchanges where a discussion has a position dictated by Christianity or blind patriotism as they exclude practicality and societal changes.

"07-03-2006","8379",6,"Bell","None","There was a world before our founding fathers came about. This world was here before even the bible. In this world, stealing and murdering was frowned upon as well. Sometimes, taking personal responsibility for your actions includes making the decision to have an abortion. Whether or not you agree with it does not change the fact that it's a form of taking responsibility. So people should only have sex if they are ready to bring a child into the world?","Prototype","220693","The Bible was not invented and released on a certain date in A.D. somewhere, Bell. It probably wasn't even called the Bible, they were scriptual laws and history, it wasn't until long after the last book was written that they were compiled and called ""The Holy Bible"". So actually yes, there were laws forbidding such things, and they deamed murder and theft absolute wrongs. It's not a woman or a man's place to kill in the name of responsibility. There's no asassin (hope I spelled that right) with good intentions that can use his beliefs to justify his career as a man butcherer. He obviously can't do that and hold his moral system, and neither can a couple. Either killing is wrong or it isn't. Unless you're absolutely and completely sure what it is or isn't, you better stay away from that clinic. You do not make a decision that isn't rock solid when you deal with life and death while trying to play God. And compromising only leaves you insecure afterwards wondering if you did the right or wrong thing. It's a whole lot better than living your life with the guilt of the memory that you killed your child for your own sexual convenience instead of taking responsibility and being careful.","rape-abortion","08:35 PM","abortion-debates","90"
