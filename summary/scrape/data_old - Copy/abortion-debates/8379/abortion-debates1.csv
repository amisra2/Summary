Being in favor of choice for rape victims is not the same as thinking that children of rape should have been killed. I would not have a problem expressing my position on choice in instances of rape in the presence of a child of rape any more than I would have a problem advocating choice for pregnancies of consensual sex in the presence of myself, a child of consensual sex. Incidentally, did you know that Malcolm X was a child of rape? His mother was raped by a KKK clansman.","rape-abortion","11:25 PM","abortion-debates","2"

If a woman who is raped and impregnated chooses to have the baby, that's fine. If she chooses abortion, that is also fine. It is wrong to force her to have the baby as much as it would be wrong to force her to choose abortion.","rape-abortion","03:44 PM","abortion-debates","7"
