"07-21-2006","8379",9,"happygrl35","None","WOW this seems to be an attitude of controlling womens sex lives by banning abortion.So forcing women to have children she doesn't want, his her version of the scarlet letter? Having children is selfish BTW.(from an evolutionary standoint). The rest of your post is pure overly emotional rhetoric.I highly doubt anyone who is seeking an abortion would even take you moral opinion of them seriously.","Prototype","223920","Have you forgotten that the only person who forced her into sex was herself? You mean taking specific words somebody else said and cheering alongside them is not overly emotional rhetoric? You're no less guilty than I am.","rape-abortion","05:24 PM","abortion-debates","122"
"07-21-2006","8379",9,"thelmoose","None","It is still sensational, inflammatory and simply not an accurate term. Makes you seem like a drama queen.","Prototype","223921","I don't think aborting a fetus is an accurately correct term. It makes you look like a person blocking the pricks to a buried conscience.","rape-abortion","05:27 PM","abortion-debates","123"
"07-21-2006","8379",9,"thelmoose","None","Please let us know how you know that. What do you think about prohibition and how that affected alcohol consumption? As well as the other crimes that were associated with it?","Prototype","223922","You don't know, thelmoose? I guess not. Well I'm not here to educate you as if you suddenly had no idea of the effect prohibition can do. I don't know what you're talking about when you say alcohol consumption. You got a specific issue?","rape-abortion","05:30 PM","abortion-debates","124"

I repeat: How do you know what effect making abortion illegal will have on the frequency of abortions and the amount of sex that occurs, both of which you asserted. 2. If you don't know what my reference to alcohol means, you may not know what Prohibition was (capital P), which is directly relevant to #1. Look it up and then you might be able to respond.","rape-abortion","06:01 PM","abortion-debates","125"

You might even call it ""accurately correct"". No idea what ""blocking the pricks to a buried conscience"" means.","rape-abortion","06:03 PM","abortion-debates","126"

Even if it hadn't completely stamped it out. Slaves were considered a legal right before Abraham Lincoln came along. It was abolished and made illegal, and now there are very few if any people who have slaves in their homes. Now do you understand?","rape-abortion","07:50 PM","abortion-debates","127"

No idea what ""blocking the pricks to a buried conscience"" means.","Prototype","223950","Because I find there isn't a single pro-abortionist who will call a fetus a baby. Why not? A lot of them will admit it is a human life form, but when the term baby comes along, they shut their mouths. Any person will call a fetus a baby, it is only until this issue comes along that they correct their language so they don't mention what they used to believe it was. Also, if they ever admitted that a fetus was a baby, they would have to admit to its killing as murder. That is why I think that.","rape-abortion","07:55 PM","abortion-debates","128"

Now do you understand?","thelmoose","223955","Huh? That's pretty whacked. You said that if abortion was illegal, ""they will start having sex less"". Please tell me what evidence you have that this would take place. You have yet to anwer that. It is clear the Prohibition reference is still sailing over your head. When Prohibition went into effect, alcohol consumption did not cease, and there was a great deal of illegal activity generated. Now, the comparison between the behavior of alcohol consumption and abortion is not perfect, I'll admit, but I wanted to discuss you assertion that making abortion illegal will reduce abortions by comparing it to an historical precedent. I think it is a fair comparison if you are talking about sexual behavior. This kind of thing is what you do in arguments, rather than making claims and not backing them up. Making abortions illegal will create unsafe abortions to occur and many unwanted children to be born. If my Prohibition comparison was off the mark, your slavery comparison is positively looney. It's a little difficult to have slaves on your plantation and not have anyone notice. One statement you made is a safe bet, but I hope you were trying to be humorous: ""now there are very few if any people who have slaves in their homes.""","rape-abortion","08:13 PM","abortion-debates","129"

You need to support your reasoning why abortion is wrong, so you use rhetoric, like ""baby murder"". A fetus is different than a baby, hence it is not wrong to have an abortion. I would not call fetus a baby, even if abortion is not considered. They are different. One is inside another person's uterus attached to that person with an umbilical cord. The other is not. If you think that abortion is wrong and should be illegal, that's your opinion. I disagree but respect your right to hold an opinion. If you resort to wordplay to back up your opinion, I object to that obfuscation. That's my point.","rape-abortion","08:23 PM","abortion-debates","130"

I find myself agreeing that making abortion illegal may not make it completely nationwide itself. But making abortions illegal will reduce sex a little if not a lot. I believe that if pregnancy was an issue you once again were made to live with, men and women would not be so casual about it. There are two points where you're predicting results are faulty. 1. Children unwanted is nonsense. There are couples out there who can't wait to adopt a child or children. 2. And making it harder to commit a crime is not wrong. If abortion were declared a crime, then illegal abortions being made would make no difference. Men get injured and killed during robberies all the time, maybe we should make that legal.","rape-abortion","11:59 AM","abortion-debates","131"

You are using abortion to control people sexs lives and you just can't stand the fact that people are having immoral sex and can actually get away with it by abortion!Seems to me you are more worried about people paying for their immoral sex by being pregnant than you the fetus.The fetus serves as a scarlet letter for you.","rape-abortion","12:25 PM","abortion-debates","134"

It is no crime to make woman stick with pregnancies they got themselves. They don't have anybody to blame but themselves, but when somebody says they can't get out of caring for the outcome of their sex, they scream persecution. Sex out of marriage is not even the issue. The thing I can't stand is that fetus's are being killed daily by people like you that think fetus's are parasites that need to be killed immediately for the sake of your freedom. Killing is murder to me, and killing a fetus early on is no less a crime than killing an already born human. This is what drives me crazy. I think a pregnancy is a great and wonderful thing for any woman, it is only a punishment to those who don't want it but won't abstance from the activities leading to it.","rape-abortion","04:10 PM","abortion-debates","135"
