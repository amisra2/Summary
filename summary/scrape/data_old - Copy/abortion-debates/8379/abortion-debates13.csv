I'm not sure on the technicol names for everything, but basically they poke the fetus with this pin like tool, and the fetus flinchs. then they remove the tool. after alittle bit they place the tool and slowly move it closer to the fetus, and the fetus moves away from it. It remembers the pain, and shows a diswant for it. Is it possible to have diswants and at the sametime not able to have wants? I don't think so, just because the fetus is eaquiped with everything it desires already does not mean it still does not desire them. And does a new born have a interest in it's future? No, its not the much different from a fetus in the way it acts. so why not just kill babies if they become to hard to handle and the mother feels that they made a bad choice having it No i didn't lol. I love how some of you twist and spin things. I feel that an unborn child is still a child, and is still a human being. I never once, not once said that this childs life is more improtant then the life of an actual existing person. I implied that it is just as important, its equal.","happygrl35","225165","Evidence the Fetus or Neonate Can Feel Pain Anands seminal work with neonates undergoing surgery demonstrated the major hormonal response to invasive practice could be significantly reduced with fentanyl added to the anesthetic regimen (Anand et al., 1987). Plasma adrenalin, noradrenaline, glucagon, aldosterone, corticosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, and 11-deoxycortisol levels, however, were significantly elevated in the non-fentanyl group up to 24 hours after surgery. Reduced hormonal response was viewed as responsible for the improved clinical outcome of the fentanyl group, which required less post-surgical ventilatory support and had reduced circulatory and metabolic complications. Anand and Hickey (1992) advanced these findings in a subsequent report indicating that neonates receiving deep anesthesia during surgery had improved post-operative morbidity compared with neonates receiving lighter anesthesia. The reduced hormonal response and improved clinical outcome following invasive surgeryin conjunction with anesthetics used for pain relief in adultsled to the conclusion that neonates could feel pain and that this pain needed to be controlled (Rogers, 1992). Further support comes from the work of Fitzgerald (1987, 1994), who has reviewed the biological development of the fetus and examined the possibility of fetal pain at each stage of development. At 7.5 weeks gestation, reflex responses to somatic stimuli begin, and touching the perioral region results in a contralateral bending of the head. The palms of the hands become sensitive to stroking at 10.5 weeks, and the rest of the body and hindlimbs become sensitive at approximately 13.5 weeks. Shortly after the development of sensitivity, repeated skin stimulation results in hyperexcitability and a generalized movement of all limbs. This hyperexcitability has been interpreted as evidence for the presence of a functional pain system, reflecting an immature but intact pain response with early hypersensitivity to stimulation (Barr, 1994). This view is not widely accepted, however, and is rejected by Fitzgerald herself. Prior to 26 weeks, the thalamocortical fibers have not yet penetrated the cortical plate, and it seems unlikely the cortical structures considered necessary for pain are responding to noxious stimulation (Mrzljak, Uylings, Kostovic, & van Eden, 1988). The evidence for cortical involvement post-26 weeks is enhanced by behavioral studies that have demonstrated focused and organized responses to noxious stimulation that can be better discriminated from other distress responses (Craig, Whitfield, Grunau, Linton, & Hadjistavropoulos, 1993). As with the hormonal response to surgery, the behavioral responses can be reduced with the use of appropriate anesthetic (Fitzgerald, Millard, & McIntosh, 1989). Having established the necessary neurobiology for pain is in place and that behavioral responses to noxious stimulation are present in premature babies of approximately 26 weeks gestation, it is logical to suggest a fetus of at least 26 weeks gestation will respond similarly to invasive practice as observed in neonates undergoing surgery. Giannakoulopoulos et al. (1994) from the Queen Charlottes Hospital in London, England, successfully demonstrated intrauterine needling to obtain blood samples from fetuses at 20 to 34 weeks gestation results in a hormonal stress response. They demonstrated that needling the innervated intraabdominal portion of the umbilical vein, rather than the placental cord (which is not innervated) resulted in increased cortisol and b-endorphin concentrations in fetal plasma. If this group or others can demonstrate the hormonal and neural stress response can be prevented with the use of appropriate anesthetics, they will have mirrored the criteria that have led to the widespread acceptance of neonatal pain. Evidence Against An Experience of Pain The undisputed discovery that the neonate and fetus launch a hormonal and neural response to invasive practice cannot be considered proof there is an experience of pain. An experience implies sensations have been interpreted in a conscious manner. Even when combined with the observations of behavior and improved clinical outcome when using anesthetics, there is still no proof there is an experience of pain. Although all of these phenomena are associated with the notion of pain, none of them adequately describe or explain the phenomenological experience of pain. These phenomena may exist independently of conscious experience. The relationship between the physiological responses of nociceptors, the hormonal and other responses of the CNS, and the behavioral outcome of these changes to the psychological response are yet to be determined (Wall & McMahon, 1986). If a proper assessment of neonatal and fetal pain is to be undertaken, we should examine the structure of the psychological experience of pain, as the biological structures have been examined, and then work backwards to the fetus and neonate to decide whether it is likely or possible these psychological structures are in place (Derbyshire, 1999). Pain experience is now widely seen as a consequence of an amalgam of cognition, sensation, and affective processes, commonly described under the rubric of the biopsychosocial model of pain. Pain is no longer regarded as merely a physical sensation of noxious stimulus and disease, but is seen as a conscious experience that may be modulated by mental, emotional, and sensory mechanisms with sensory and emotional components. The biopsychosocial concept emphasizes the multidimensional nature of illness, injury, and pain, rather than emphasizing pain as a purely physical fact of illness or injury. Pain has been described as a multidimensional phenomena for some time (Melzack & Casey, 1968), and this understanding is reflected in the current IASP definition of pain as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage (Merskey, 1991). If this multidimensionality is the basis of conscious pain experience, it seems unlikely we can attribute this experience to the neonate or unborn fetus, which is naive to the cognitive, affective, and evaluative experiences necessary for pain awareness. This is accepted in the current definition of pain, which is further expanded to state, Pain is always subjective. Each individual learns the application of the word through experiences related to injury in early life. Pain does not, so to speak, spring forth from the depths of the persons mind prior to any experience, but is gradually formed as a consequence of general conscious development. Interestingly, even those authors who support a concept of fetal pain tend to back away when confronted with the need to explain pain phenomenology. Giannakoulopoulos et al (1994), for example, distanced themselves from any implied fetal pain experience with the statement, a hormonal response cannot be equated with the perception of pain. Lloyd-Thomas and Fitzgerald (1996) have suggested if feeling and pain are properly understood, the fetus cannot be said to feel pain. A further reason to doubt the viability of fetal pain post-26 weeks gestation is the development of the fetal cortex. Although the thalamocortical fibers penetrate the cortical plate at approximately 26 weeks gestation, the cortical regions that have been identified as important in processing the various components of pain (Derbyshire, 2000) do not become fully responsive until after birth (Chugani & Even a newborn has a basic interest in it's future.It looks towards feedings and bonding with mom.Not to mention a newborn is sentient and is a seperate individule proected by law. Even so,when there is a conflict of interest (mother vs fetus) one of them is going to lose out.In this case I put the already born sentient person before the non-born non-sentient fetus.You can not be equal in this situation,one is going to be valued more than the other.Seeing that forced pregnancy for rape is your solution you but the value of the fetus before the mother PERIOD.","rape-abortion","04:00 PM","abortion-debates","181"

"07-28-2006","8379",13,"Evan","None","Im sorry to hear you had to go through that, i truly am. But a childs life is no more meaningless then your own. A CHILDS LIFE SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHED, a child has a body, health concerns, and should not be deemed any less significant then yours. A childs life is not null and void because of the horrible actions of their biological father. Ouch... i don't think you know what your talking about. I never once suggested that you consider raising the child with him.. heck if i had my way you wouldn't be able to because he'd be dead. I love women, and i have much sympathy for you and others that have gone through what you have. But i also love children, and by no means, in no circumstance should their lives be ended by another NO.... you don't understand. won't someone please think about the children!!! I understand that what you've gone through is horrible, and I do not consider others who have gone through it and have gotten pregnant stupid at all!!! However, LIFE IS MORE IMPORTANT!!! you should not kill another just because it has inconvenienced you. I'm sorry to all women that have been raped, and i hold women in very high regard and i respect them very much. BUT I VALUE LIFE, CONSIDERBLE, especially that of a childs. It happened, and im sorry, but do not, i repeat DO NOT sentence the child to death!!!","jitobear","225174","Any rape for me would be very quickly followed by the morning after pill. At that point the fetus doesn't have a brain, let alone concerns in said brain. And when are you gonna get that it isn't about punishment? Unless they are already born - like my son? How about all the civilian children who die in war every day? Or the ones that starve every day? Are you protesting the war in Iraq? On the bandwagpon with Bono and the ONE campaign? Or is it only those not yet born that you are loving to the point of disrupting and possible destroying the lives of women you don't know and their families? I highly doubt you understand what I have been through - as a rape victim, in pregnancy or as a mother. Again with the trivialization - pregnancy is more than inconvenience. If I were pregnant again and could not work me and my son would get hungry fast and at the very least lose my house. But no worries - we all just live on air right? How dare I want the conveniences of home and food! Sorry Evan - I will not jeopardize my situation for some rapists seed just because YOU think its precious. Last I checked YOU ain't paying MY bills.","rape-abortion","04:59 PM","abortion-debates","183"
