I would be a hypocrite if I said that somebody else may be right.","thelmoose","224748","I didn't think the purpose of debate was to get ""others to think like I do"". I didn't think anyone could do that, ever. Why would you want to do that? That sounds more like proselytizing than debtating. I thought the goal of these discussion is to share ideas. Certainly, the debators have different, often diametrically opposed viewpoints, and they likely will never agree. The debator points out where they believe the other's points are inaccurate or invalid, with the intention of educating each other. I don't see how any person could ever accomplish the impossible or unwanted task of getting them to think like I do. You said it would be ""hypocritical"" to say that someone else may be right. That's rich. I would call that open-minded, a willingness to learn or intelligent - anything but hypocritical. This is very revealing. It sounds like you have no intention of changing you mind - it is already made up - if you never consider that another person may be right. Which must also mean you never consider that your way of thinking may be wrong. That's pretty sad.","rape-abortion","11:13 AM","abortion-debates","154"

I was under the impression that your beiefs are simply the beliefs associated with your religious persuasion. Is that not so? What evidence outside of your faith has contributed to your position? Something scientific, philosophical?","rape-abortion","11:32 AM","abortion-debates","155"
"07-26-2006","8379",11,"None","None","None","Prototype","224822","It was all of those things when I first started. I almost changed my mind when people mentioned rape and incest victims, and for a while I believed that abortion was an outright gray area in life that I would have to punt at for lack of certanity. But I looked into it further and am satisfied that what I believe is right.","rape-abortion","03:46 PM","abortion-debates","156"

However I did not come here for the sport, and not just for the education. I believe that I might in fact show someone else that my way is better. Not everyone who comes here and reads the threads are as concrete in their views as you or I. And considering that abortion is such an important issue in America, I think it is worth the time. Thelmoose, this issue is very important to me. I've debated and spoke with the confidence that I knew what was right. If somebody asked me if I might be wrong, and I said ""maybe!"", that'd be like questioning my whole idea of what I considered ""truth"". Ways of thinking can be wrong. I don't believe how I view this issue is wrong, though. Oh, and I'll refer you to my most recent post to Sinjin regarding how I came to that conclusion. I DID believe I was wrong once.","rape-abortion","03:55 PM","abortion-debates","157"

That path seems too limiting and naive and runs the risk of missing out on some of life's sublime ideas. Life is wonderfully complicated and and there can be many truths.

"07-27-2006","8379",11,"simone","None","You'd better carefully explain this statement. The way you phrase it it sounds like a ""mother"" or woman of reproductive age is merely a breeder cow with no rights.","chloe","225026","I find it ironic for you to make such a statement, seeing how it is the naturalist pro choice position that has no meaningful basis to distinguish between mother and mere breeder cow. However...a pro life position holds that human life is sacred and therefore the life of the mother has an inherent dignity and real meaning that distinguishes it from the mere breeder cow.","rape-abortion","08:40 PM","abortion-debates","161"

"07-28-2006","8379",11,"None","None","None","Evan","225059","Personally, if you want my opinion... what am i talking about, of course you do. I think that in no circumstance should anyone get an abortion. Not even in the case of rape. The only time abortion should become an option should be if the mothers life is in danger. There is no reason why someone should kill another human being just because its unwanted. In most cases, its because people didn't take the responsibility and use protection or that didn't work. If this is the case and you couldn't possibly afford to take care of the child or if you just don't want it... take responsibility! DO NOT KILL this human being because its not in your plan. Put it up for adoption. And in the unfortunate circumstance where the mother was rape i think that the mother should have the baby. I feel extremely sorry for that women that had to go through what she went through, and i wish that who ever did it to her could get the death penalty, but thats no reason why you should punish the child for the horrible sins of their father. According to a 2000 - 2001 AGI survey only .6 of abortions where done becasue of rape. So thats hardly even an excuse for ""pro choice"" people. And only 16.9% of abortions where done after using contraceptive safely. that means 82.5% of abortions are done because people are to stupid to take the proper steps to having safe sex, and then won't take responsibility for they're actions. http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/poli...abreasons.html","rape-abortion","12:46 AM","abortion-debates","163"

On top of that another with the illusion the we go from conception to birth like its cheap and easy peasy. I also refuse to swallow the ""responsibility"" argument from an individual who expects the same responsibility from those he terms ""stupid"" and a rape victim. Anyone who believes they have the right to hi-jack the life, financials, and health of a rape victim for the better part of year is little better than an ally to rapists - but that's just my opinion - and of course you wanted to hear it.","rape-abortion","08:52 AM","abortion-debates","164"

He didn't say a single thing like that. And it's all the more reason for women to be more careful to avoid sex till they know they can cope with a pregnancy. You're way out of line, Jitobear. Rapists do not rape women to get them pregnant. They do it because they're evil and have no control over their dark sexual fantasies. If you hadn't noticed, he said rape victims ought to get the death penalty. Not quite an ally. And he said that the reasons behind abortions BESIDES rape are stupid, not everything else. You really need to respond to what is written, Jitobear; Not change the meaning and twist what the words mean around to make Evan look evil.","rape-abortion","11:54 AM","abortion-debates","165"
