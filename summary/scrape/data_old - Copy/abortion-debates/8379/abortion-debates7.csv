People outlaw things because they dont feel comfortable with those things being aloud - not because some book that most people dont even care about mandates certan rules. You have absolutly no basis for this position.

For the sake of argument, the only way to realistically enforce such a ban would be sterilization of the male of the species while utilizing a sperm bank for reproduction purposes.

How would you proceed to eliminate abortion in all US states other than using federal legislation denying states rights?

The farthest it may get is banning it except in cases of rape or in cases where the mother's health is at risk. But we all know what lawyers will do with the latter clause. They will say that an unexpected pregnancy is detrimental to the mother's mental health and use that as justification for abortion. So I really don't see anything happening with this issue legally.","rape-abortion","10:14 PM","abortion-debates","93"

Others in that portion of society used facilities in the Caribbean, Mexico and Europe. Then, as now proposed by many, only the poor and working poor produced unwanted children because they couldn't secure an abortion. When I read other posters, not you, advocating people of lower classes without financial resources or the potential to acquire them take personal responsibility for emotional sex producing unwanted reproduction, I can't help but wonder how long they've either been naive to a point of immaturity or so delusional even meds can't help. All I see with any entity, state or federal, outlawing abortion is a new tax burden on that portion of society who pays the bulk of personal taxes, not those clamoring to follow a belief system, which, splinter groups aside, is unquestionably the driving force of the majority of those against abortion. Leaving abortion decisions to states is the correct process as the constitution has no reference to abortion. Unless the new SCOTUS majority decides to use the bent commerce act to step in and ensure states like Georgia and others can track and deny public benefits of any type to any pregnant individual who obtains an abortion in a state where abortion is legal. That would quickly lead to federal legislation against abortion, carving out an entire new federal bureaucracy to care for unwanted reproduction and developing a new social sub-class evading federal monetary collection actions.","rape-abortion","10:05 AM","abortion-debates","96"

I want women that have had abortions and feel guilt to get counseling. I want women that have had abortions and feel guilt to seek help. I want women who are pregnant and want abortions to receive comprehensive counseling so that 1. They understand their options better. I want them to see that adoption is a concrete idea, not an abstract one. I want them to see that being a parent is not the end of the world. 2. They have a better support system in place, whether they have an abortion or choose to remain pregnant. 3. They recognize that post-abortion stress and guilt may occur, and are aware of all health risks. 4. They receive health care, regardless of their financial situation. 5. They talk to women who have had abortions, who have done adoption, who have been adopted, who are single parents, joint parents, etc. What do you want? If all those people are inside your body, and you are their sole life support system, and they have no brain, no consciousness, then go ahead. Apples to apples. Reasoning that is ""convenience"" to you is not so to others. Reasons of poverty, health, education, etc. may be seen as ""convenience"" to you, but create great problems not only for the mother, but the child you so desire to see the world. So you still see them as convenient and it upsets you. I can respect that. However, regardless of how you feel about it, the reasons still exist, and women still have abortions. So how can anti and pro choice people work together to help solve these problems? No one wins the abortion debate. I don't like abortion, I don't advocate that my friends get abortions, but I would never wish to outlaw it. Until our society recognizes problems women (and therefore their children) face with unwanted pregnancies and does something about it, then abortion must be an option. You've said nothing about the mental health issue you brought up and I refuted. Do you think that women who are pregnant and don't wish to be have no mental health issues surrounding that? How do you address that? You've said nothing about your earlier claim that people who have sex should be prepared to be parents and I said that that must include 14 year olds who have sex, people who's birth control failed, married couples having sex for the enjoyment of it, perhaps a couple in their 40's with grown children, etc. Should they all be forced to be parents, whether it be for nine months or eighteen years? You've also said nothing about my reply to your ""you've made your bed, now sleep in it comment"". I said that that comment certainly sounds like you're making being a mother punishment for having sex. Is that how you feel? Should women be punished for having sex by being forced into motherhood, whether it be for nine months or the rest of her life? This is not showing care for the child. Mothers who are forced into pregancy are not going to show the best care for their child, and ultimately, the child will suffer. How are you going to address this? It's really easy to make abstract claims like ""People have tried to separate sex from pregnancy and eliminate any responsibility involved"" so abortion should be illegal but when faced with reality you might find that your concrete line is now a little dotted. Yes it is killing a developing life. Yes, it is a horrible procedure. What solutions do you have to make the need for abortion be eliminated? In response to your ""personal responsibility"" comment, sometimes an abortion is taking personal responsibility. Why does taking responsibility only mean continuing a pregnancy to birth? Because that's what you think is morally correct? Do you also think, based upon your above example, that people who smoke should be denied health care for their smoke-related health issues, because that's taking personal responsibility? You smoked, you may now die, and that may effect your...oh, children (could be parentless now!) but you made your bed, now lie in it?","rape-abortion","02:09 PM","abortion-debates","98"

You realize that some have abortions for what they believe are good, honest reasons. This is excellent! I am glad that you, although you disagree with abortion, and (correct me if I'm wrong) you don't think these are good reasons, you do understand that these other people do . I am thrilled!!! Seriously, I'm not kidding. I think that this is a big deal and perhaps you are starting to feel some kind of compassion for women who are facing unwanted pregnancies and looking for abortions. Good for you! [It's too bad that you go on to say the last bit I've quoted down below here.] As far as sexual convenience goes, I am sure that there are some women who have abortions as a form of birth control. I think this is terrible. I still do not think they should be ""forced"" to remain pregnant as a type of punishment for their behavior, but I do think that they should be strongly encouraged to be on some kind of birth control. However, how do you weed these women out? How do you identify them, and do you have any stats on this? I have not personally come across any woman who has multiple abortions who do so as a form of birth control. Abortion is a HUGE, mind racking, large, looming, & momentous decision, and I do not believe many women have them as a form of birth control for their own sexual convenience. Of course, I don't know what exactly you mean by ""sexual convenience"". Do you think that women who have abortions for ""sexual convenience"" are the majority? [QUOTE]I did not force them to have sex, I did not push them into the rush hour traffic to get hit by a car, I did not help it along. ... You're trying to shift the burden of responsibility of the pregnancy from the back of the whiny complainy people who are stuck where they are onto the back of those who are trying to make them live with their own actions and take personal responsbility. [/QUOUT] This is exactly the problem. You want to outlaw abortion, and then wash your hands of the problems the little babies will face because of it. The problems will still exist! People will still suffer! You cannot take choices away from them and then forget about it. And I say again, why does taking ""personal responsibility"" only mean carrying the child to term? It doesn't. It does to you, because that's what's right to you. But for others, taking responsibility means not bringing another unwanted child into the world. They do have to care for it, in your mandated pregnancy and forced childbirth world. They do have to, and they don't have a choice. It will effect the child negatively. Do you think women who are going through an unwanted pregnancy are going to be the best pregnant woman they can be for their child? Do you think they'll spend $ (if they even have it) to go to the doctor, eat right, not take drugs, smoke, drink, etc. How come no one ever addresses this when I bring it up? It's glossed over completely. Not your problem, huh? As long as they have the kid, who cares? I am glad that there are couples you know that have adopted children. I hope they inspire many people to do the same. No you don't care for the kids. You just pushed them all aside when you said, to paraphrase, ""I didn't do it so it's not my problem"" and washed yourself clean of 'blame' for their existence. I have not heard one single idea from you about how you are going to help these kids. I'm not just talking adoption here, either. How are you going to get little crack babies adopted, kids with disabilities, kids of minorities, the kids whose mothers decide to keep even though they are ill prepared to mother them either emotionally, physically, or financially, etc. Yes, I think everyone should have a very serious view on sex. Actually, I think many people should be sterilized. Like my next door neighbor, who just has a severe 'domestic violence' incident with his girlfriend who puts up with it. I think he should be sterilized and then beat with large iron rods so he knows what it's like. Yes, true. Allowed? Huh? Are you saying that, for example, married couples using birth control shouldn't be ""allowed"" to have sex unless they are prepared to be parents? 14 year olds who have sex are obligated to be parents, whether for nine months or eighteen years? Right, punish those women by forcing them to bear children! Right on! That's what's best for women, their children, the fetuses, the fathers, and society. What a great way of thinking!! Excellent!!
