"02-17-2007","9510",8,"None","None","None","SpicyGirl","251290","I have went to the sites that VTCruiser provided And that woman does in fact say that black people are weeds and shoud be exterminated. If anyone wants to argue the fact that she did not say that. Even after seeng the site, then my guess is that you must share the same views. Because the woman clearly states that. Not only that, but she also promoted genocide within the black community by saying that more abortion clinics should be opened in black areas, to prevent black babies from being born. Anyone who could not see, that must either be blind. Or must be covering for her actions because they agree with them. It must be one way or the other since people are reading it, and still doubting she said it. Not to mention she was with the kkk. The only weeds in the human race, are those who choose to hate. For which Margret was the very weed that she felt black people were. Because she was motivated by hatred.","slavery-abortion","12:57 AM","abortion-debates","110"

Or are you deliberatly ignoring them because you know you have no answer and are too proud to admit you're full of XXXX? And do you have any evidence to show that PP was infact forcing Blacks to undergo abortions? How is offering a service on demand, a CONSUMER'S demand genocide? I suspect you won't answer for the reason I gave.","slavery-abortion","01:17 AM","abortion-debates","111"
"02-17-2007","9510",8,"SpicyGirl","251272","I'm by no means pro-choice. I view potential of a fetus as more important, then the womans choice. People don't like it, but thats the way I feel. Also, you mentioned that you wwouldn't want to see abortion banned. Well I would not be oppossed to it if it happened. I would not mind if it was banned. I'm just not going to sit up here and keep pushing the issue. I don't care to make choices for others, but I'm not oppossed to seeing abortion banned. I thought it was the other way around. I thought you guys did not mind aborion. I never knew that some of you didn't like abortion since you pro-choice people, are always arguing us pro-life people down as far as abortion goes. Some of the statements that I've heard. Lead me to believe that pro-choice people felt as if rap/incest victims automaticly want abortions. I never said that. Because I did go to the links and look at the information. Yeah right. So the next time you quote me, I should just look at it and say,""She must not be talking to me. This has nothing to do with me."" I don't think so. It has everthing to do with me since you are talking to me. And you refused to stop talking to me. When I said you should stop, you said,""No."" So your comments concerning me, do have something to do with me. How long you've been on this site however, does not.","jitobear","251324","But ity seems you are not interested in forcing that opinion into others actions - that no matter how you feel about the subject - you aren't going to make choices for other people. Banning abortion is a bad idea. For one - it won't stop abortion. It will just give those who have fought to make it ilegal a chance to compliement themselves while pregnant women will continue to face real life issues with fewer safe choices. I think most people don't find abortion a pleasant thing. We fight those who are pro-life because most would seek to criminalize abortion and that is something we do not want. Our stance acknowledges that we don't know what women in these situations want. You don't either. Each woman's life is unique. The point is we aren't going to decide for them and we don't you (lifers) should either. I thought when I told you to check out the Colage site you said ""no thanks."" Of course I am responding to you. I tend to post in the gay rights, abortion, and religion threads (and once in awhile other threads). I respond to the posts I wish to. Sometimes your's, sometimes others. I am not following you around. If you seriously don't want to debate me - put me on ignore.","slavery-abortion","10:30 AM","abortion-debates","112"
"02-17-2007","9510",8,"SpicyGirl","251346","I believe they view a fetus as less important then a womans rights to her body. Fewer life choices?! Care to explain that one? Us pro-lifers know whats best!! LOL *joke* Well, I don't think anyone should tell people how to live their lives. I mean, you can tell them and they will still make the choies they want to make. So, why waste your breath? What I do is not tell them what to do, I just object to their choices, if I see otherwise. No. Its too much fun arguing with you.","jitobear","251418","I would agree with this. No - I said fewer safe choices. If faced with an unplanned pregnancy, and that pregnany will result in serious negative impacts in the woman's life, she will likely resort to extreme and dangerous actions to end it. As it stands, abortion is legal and safe. So they say. Fair enough. I think we may have lost the wind on this one for now. I am sure we will spark off again sometime soon. Have a good weekend and EVERYONE - watch the NBA All-Star game!","slavery-abortion","06:57 PM","abortion-debates","114"
"02-17-2007","9510",8,"Shooterandproud","250550","The right to abortion goes hand in hand with the right to privacy. The government can't regulate how big your pubes are, therefore they cannot strictly regulate abortion. Its really just common sense.","Phyllis","251425","Reading back through this thread, I realized that I must have missed this post. I'm glad you posted it because although the post is ridiculous, it nevertheless has comedic value. Can the government tell someone that they cannot beat their children, even if they choose to beat them only in the privacy of their own home? And further than that, it is an obvious fact that just because something SHOULD be in the Constitution does not mean it actually IS in the Constitution.","slavery-abortion","07:19 PM","abortion-debates","115"

This post was from way back, when there was some fringe discussion of Roe v. Wade. I'm not sure why you are pointing out that you are not a constitutional expert. Surely you aren't suggesting that a constitutional expert could legitimately say that, even though X is not in the Constitution, it deserves to be in the Constitution, and therefore X is in the Constitution?","slavery-abortion","08:08 PM","abortion-debates","117"
