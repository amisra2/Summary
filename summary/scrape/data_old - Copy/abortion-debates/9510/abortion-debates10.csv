"02-19-2007","9510",10,"obvious_child","251643","It's ageicide in that the procedure being performed is specifically targeted to end the life of a specific age group, hospice care could be argued to be the same as it is a set of procedures targeting a specific age group that ends in death. True, the -icdes would imply that there is no choice, but for the sake of argument agecide is the most accurate term next to genocide. I must admit it's pretty entertaining to link the pro-life group with Communism and the pro-choice with Capitalism.","ShadowPikachu","251648","Agreed. It is definately a more accurate term than genocide. I also think it is rather entertaining to link them as well.","slavery-abortion","01:47 AM","abortion-debates","136"
"02-19-2007","9510",10,"obvious_child","251647","Considering I never said that you're lying . If you believe you're not a liar, please show me where I said fetuses don't exist. I dare you. In fact I dare you so much I have a little reward here: if you can prove I said fetuses don't exist I'll praise you as being right all of the time. Well considering I never said what you fabricated, you're asking the wrong person. Perhaps you have confused me with someone else. Fetuses do exist. All existing cells have age. Since fetuses are at least several hundred billion cells, they must have age. You are most likely thinking of Shooter who said that fetusus don't in the context of sentience and slaves.","VTCruiser","251652","so you think a fetus has sentience?","slavery-abortion","01:56 AM","abortion-debates","137"

Seems like a huge contridiction in their belief systems. I can see being aganist such medical services (like organ selling) on the health threats to society without creating a contridiction in beliefs.","slavery-abortion","01:57 AM","abortion-debates","138"

"02-19-2007","9510",10,"obvious_child","251646","How can it be appropriate when it fails to meet the dictionary definition? Or is this another activity on Debateforums where we change definitions to suit our arguments? Ageicide is by far a more accurate term.","chloe","251658","Abortion is a specific procedure that targets a specific group of people who are not only united by and targeted because of their general age, but by many other factors. Yes, genocide is a good word for that. If you look at the statistics of abortions among races you can conclude a genocide is occurring among the black population. Planned parenthood is a big participant in this. Also, are you just making up terms off the top of your head? Is agecide in webster's? What is your stance on abortion?","slavery-abortion","02:02 AM","abortion-debates","140"
"02-19-2007","9510",10,"VTCruiser","251652","so you think a fetus has sentience?","obvious_child","251659","Moving the bar again VT to cope with your constant argumentive failures? So you admit I never said what you said I said? I'll take that as apology and a admission you were quite wrong. I believe once enough neutral connections have been established that sentience follows. How many is the minimum necessary however is another matter all together. But sentience is not a issue for me in the decision making. Whether something has sentience is not really that important. I eat meat. Cows, pigs, sheep and poltury are all senitent as they perceive, are aware and are conscious of sense impressions. I still eat them though.","slavery-abortion","02:02 AM","abortion-debates","141"
"02-19-2007","9510",10,"VTCruiser","251655","you meant to say murder on demand right?? oh ok...","obvious_child","251660","You people and your inability to use proper definitions. Murder is illegal killing. Since abortion is legal up to certain timeframes, it cannot be illegal. Therefore your Abortion is not murder. If abortion is murder, then so is killing a enemy soldier.","slavery-abortion","02:03 AM","abortion-debates","142"

I asked you to show me where any of your criteria meet Webster's, I see you have failed to meet this very simple request. As you have failed to do so, we therefore must eject your claim that abortion is genocide on the grounds that is fails to meet the dictionary definition from the thread. Changing definitions to suit arguments is a pathetic way of arguing. -cide is a common suffix for killing. Age is obvious. Attach the two and you get killing of specific age. Not hard for those with educations. Don't like it but people should be free to make their own decisions. I try to keep my beliefs consistant, unlike many people. I believe in the free market, restricting someone's ability to do what they want with this belief, especially on using a market service is a contridiction. Furthermore, I don't like crime and I don't like welfare. You should read FREAKONOMICs to understand the relationship between crime/welfare and abortion.","slavery-abortion","02:07 AM","abortion-debates","144"

But on that note, I like the idea of scanning everything in a library and putting online. That would significently lower costs and we could replace libraries with public computer labs that only connect to a central library. Much lower costs doing the same kind of gov't duty!","slavery-abortion","02:34 AM","abortion-debates","149"
