I personally think slavery was wrong because I have great sympathy toward people who were forced against their will to work under horendous conditions for people who used utterly false arguements to support such exploitation (arguments about the innate inferiority of all African American's in inherent capability, and about God supporting the right of whites to own blacks as slaves). It is the suffering of slavery, coupled with the false reasons for that exploitation, that lie behind my abhorence of slavery. Neither of these reasons have anything to do with the abortion debate prior to the third trimester (before which there is no suffering).","ShadowPikachu","250203","Yeah, I don't really see what this all has to do with abortion, unless maybe you were to try to draw an analogy between the enslavement of humans for slavery, and the people who are calling for the ""enslavement"" of women with abortion (forcing women to continue their pregnancy against their will). That's the only parallel I see, and even then, it still is a little weak.","slavery-abortion","03:48 PM","abortion-debates","16"

"02-08-2007","9510",2,"Steeeeve","250167","but they do support the choice to abort a fetus or embryo. An argument made for slavery was that ""you don't have to own them but don't tell us what to do""..a fairly similar argument but doesn't show whether or not abortion is wrong just that some lines of thinking should be questioned. Pro-lifers are like slave traders? What a pro-lifers trading? Anyone who denies a human being a fundamental human right is a slave trader...like a right to life...???","Shooterandproud","250300","And they have. The only reason you think a fetus is equatable to a human is because it is made of organic matter. What if there was a piece of cardboard in the mothers stomach? Its non-organic and is in the same mental state as an embryo (that is, no mental state). The only difference is the matter its made out of. Thats not the point. The Pro-lifers advocate force, just like the slave advocates did. The pro-choicers advocate freedom and choice, just like the abolitionists. That logic can be applied to weeds or trees. Anything that is non-sentient, or non-mental existant. Should we make gardening illegal too? The thing is, you have no base for calling it a human being or giving it the same rights as us. Human beings are, by nature, sentient. That is what makes us different from wildlife. When that only difference is separated, then it should not share the same rights as you or me. An accurate analogy would be someone who's brain was ripped out and was kept on life support. It would only be a body, no person inside of it. Same goes with an embryo. It simply cannot override the rights of its host.","slavery-abortion","12:26 AM","abortion-debates","21"

Even if slaves are treated like Gods I still believe it is wrong.","Another opinion","250322","What are the underlying reasons for that belief? For me, the underlying reasons for most of my moral belief system are sympathy toward other human beings coupled with an idea that any moral rule needs to be universally applied in its intention. I think that most of us find slavery repulsive because we can sympathize with the suffering of the slave. That is certainly the case for me. On a side note, your idea that all people should be treated the same is a nice idea in general but all of us deviate from that when there are reasons to deviate from that. Criminals are treated in a worse fashion than others because there are reasons to take away certain rights from them because of their own behavior. Children and severely mentally incapacitated individuals have certain rights taken away from them for their own good - ex. the right to wander around where they please. By the way, this paragraph does not relate to abortion in that I am not saying that fetus' rights should be taken away because of any particular reason relating to what the fetus did. My view is that we give rights to people in the first place because we can relate to and empathize with people and would expect to have those same rights if we were in their shoes. This is an approach that necessitates a mental existence in the being in question.","slavery-abortion","09:54 AM","abortion-debates","22"
"02-08-2007","9510",2,"chloe","249124","Yeah, there are many similarities between abortion and slavery. Traces of the days of slavery are still present with us today in the form racism. This racism is perhaps seen most clearly today in abortion. The abortion movement preys upon minority communities. Check out this website: http://www.blackgenocide.org/ ""Planned Parenthood is the largest abortion provider in America. 78% of their clinics are in minority communities. Blacks make up 12% of the population, but 35% of the abortions in America. Are we being targeted? Isn't that genocide? We are the only minority in America that is on the decline in population. If the current trend continues, by 2038 the black vote will be insignificant. Did you know that the founder of Planned Parenthood, Margaret Sanger, was a devout racist who created the Negro Project designed to sterilize unknowing black women and others she deemed as undesirables of society? The founder of Planned Parenthood said, ""Colored people are like human weeds and are to be exterminated."" Is her vision being fulfilled today?""","Another opinion","250323","Are you claiming that black women are being forced into abortion? If not, then how is ""genocide"" being committed if they themselves are choosing abortion? By the way, the rates of abortion in whites vs blacks are similar to the rates of teenage pregnancy between whites and blacks. From http://www.teenpregnancy.org/america...sp?ID=3&sID=20 , there is a roughly three times higher rate of teenage pregnancies among black women than among white women (153/1000 vs 55/1000). From http://www.abortionfacts.com/statistics/race.asp , the abortion rate for whites is 12/1000 while it is 31/1000 for black women. Note, the 1000 refers to 1000 women of child-bearing age (or 1000 teenage women in the case of teenage pregancy rates). Since there is a much higher rate of teenage pregnacny among black women, it makes sense that there would be a much higher rate of abortion among black women. So, the main question is ""Why is there so much more teenage pregnancy among black women?"". I would think that poverty is a main reason. African Americans started off poor because of the legacy of slavery and stayed poor for ages because of unbridled discrimination. The last few decades have produced enormous changes in laws and practices governing discrimination. Unfortunately for African Americans, just as they were gaining more freedoms from discrimination in law and practice, socio-economic changes in the US made it more difficult for anybody who was poor (black or white) to get into the middle class. However, I hope that more African Americans will be able to take more advantage of those opportunities that they do still have to advance to higher levels (in education, sports, etc.).","slavery-abortion","10:01 AM","abortion-debates","23"

I don't see you advocating that anyone else's resources, bodily organs, time, finances, and level of health be used/put at risk against their will. You do advocate this for pregnant women.

Could you briefly elaborate, please, about the legal underpinnings that suggest a connection between Roe v. Wade and the slavery decision? I am interested in understanding your point.

My suggestion in this thread was merely meant to say that the constitutional right to abortion in Roe v. Wade was derived in the same fashion that the constitutional right to slavery was derived in Dred Scott v. Sandford. It would be a further suggestion of mine that if one is wrong, the other by logical necessity is also wrong. It is common to hear everyone allude to argue that their position is required by a respect for fundamental human rights. It has happened even in this very thread. And, as I have indicated, I am trying to figure out what a human right is and why X should be considered a human right. And, that notwithstanding, in the United States it is Constitutional rights that command legal respect, and Constitutional rights do not necessarily entail all human rights. In essence, my basic concern on these forums (throughout all the treads I participate in, and in all the categories) is the examination of constitutional rights. At this stage, I am more concerned with who ought to decide abortion policy (or various other policies) in the United States than I am what that policy actually is/would/ought to be. I hope that makes a little sense.","slavery-abortion","12:37 PM","abortion-debates","26"

That is a topic (who/how decisions of abortion policy) that one can more reasonably argue than whether abortion is moral or not, though it takes more legal and constitutional law knowledge than (at least) I have. I do support a more pragmatic approach to this topic, along the lines of what do we actually need to do about this complex problem. Deciding what is a human or baby or what it feels or thinks is essentially an unanswerable issue. Interesting philosophical arguments to be sure, unless one wants to be dogmatic and insist their own is the only way to see things. The other issue of what constitutes a ""human right"" legal or constitutionally (or even if such a thing exists in those domains) is also an interesting topic, that I had not considered until now. Thanks for the clarification.","slavery-abortion","01:39 PM","abortion-debates","27"

If a fetus is made of cardboard then it is still a person and still deserving of rights. really? Choice? I never heard a abolitionists saying ""you can choose to have a slave or not...haha. Furthermore, a slaver owner advocated freedom...why do you think they came up with the ""states rights"" XXXX to cover up their need for slavery? I choose freedom for all...not freedom for some, I can't say the same about the other side. no base for calling it a human being? Other than the fact that a fetus is scientifical a human being. Seems you have no basis for saying I can't call a fetus a human being. Apes are sentient...guess your theory is out the window. Either that or Apes need to be freed from the zoo. and a brain with no body kept on life support is only a brain...no person. If beg the question here. I deny that a level of intelligence is needed to deserve rights. I disagree that what you can do is a requirement..only what you are (that being a human). Still, I quoted you as saying ""a basic human fundamental right""...I am not sure what this right is or where it comes from or why it is fundamental or why it only applies to the humans you think it should apply to. Perhaps we should restrict it to only white folks again...after all, white folks are the only humans with white skin which makes them different from all other wildlife...right?","slavery-abortion","04:53 PM","abortion-debates","28"

A majority does not determine what is moral in the absolute sense (although they do enforce it by law...but lets speak outside of that for now). The most basic belief is that others are to be treated with the same respect as myself. I don't think it gets more basic than that...unless you get into where my morals actually derive from.
