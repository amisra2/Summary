Also, it appears that Sanger is quoted a report from the United States government. So I guess the United States itself is to blame for this sort of ignorance.","slavery-abortion","12:59 PM","abortion-debates","121"
"02-18-2007","9510",9,"None","None","None","Another opinion","251522","Regarding what Margaret Sanger did or did not say, some of your biased sites claim she said that African Americans are like weeds while the Planned Parenthood site (arguably also biased) claims that such claims are false and that various passages and books were falsely credited to her. I could take the trouble to try to do a more full search myself to look into this but I would find it, personally, of negligible interest and priority. Why? Because it REALLY DOES NOT MATTER for today's policies and directions. Look, Thomas Jefferson made an extraordinary contribution to our Democracy BUT he owned slaves and had an illegitimate child with one. Does that mean that we discredit all the good that he did because of the bad? No. We appreciate the good while disparaging the bad. The bad that he did - i.e. in having a relationship with his black slave - should be disparaged but it did not have any long term effect so it is of much lesser import. The legacy of Thomas Jefferson which exists today is the one which had the longer lasting effect - i.e. his contributions to Democracy. Similarly, on a different level, Margaret Sanger was a supporter of Eugenics - which nearly everyone is against today, including myself and the great majority of pro-choice supporters. However, the Eugenics movement never gained strong power and has no legacies which continue to this day. Also, whether or not she did make disparaging comments about blacks, those comments have nothing to do with the efforts of Planned Parenthood today, so why do you find them of such importance. She may have had her negative sides that should be disparaged (just like the negative sides of anyone who has made positive contributions). However, I do strongly appreciate her contributions toward contraception for women. Are you claiming that Planned Parenthood or any such organization encourages Eugenic practices against African Americans today? If so, then where is your evidence?","slavery-abortion","02:10 PM","abortion-debates","122"

And do you have any evidence to show that PP was infact forcing Blacks to undergo abortions? Oh wait, you're VT Cruiser [u]you never have any evidence.[/i] So I guess that's a big fat no, you have no argument and everything you've said is factless opinion. How is offering a service on demand, a CONSUMER'S demand genocide?","obvious_child","251555","So VT I take by your failure to reply to this question directed at you several times that you admit your claim of PP as engaging in acts of Genocide was wrong?","slavery-abortion","06:11 PM","abortion-debates","123"

I have read the previous 20 posts. Many of them take quotes from your own links and use them aganist you disproving your claims, many of them criticize you for deliberately ignoring questions asked to you, and many of them XXXX very large holes in your arguments, yet you ignore them all. Perhaps you need to reexamine your view that you're always right, the evidence seems to suggest you're not. Mere statements by a hack do not prove your claims that PP was engaging a genocide. DO YOU OR DO YOU NOT HAVE EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS THAT PP WAS INFACT FORCING BLACKS TO HAVE ABORTIONS?","slavery-abortion","12:50 AM","abortion-debates","126"

Every ethnicity has abortions, and no one is forcing them. All PP is doing is offering a capitalistic service on demand. There is no mandatory abortions, no specific advertisments to one ethnicity over another. They are offering a market service in a market economy: how is that genocide? Neither you nor VT have thought out your arguments.","slavery-abortion","12:52 AM","abortion-debates","127"

True, the -icdes would imply that there is no choice, but for the sake of argument agecide is the most accurate term next to genocide. I must admit it's pretty entertaining to link the pro-life group with Communism and the pro-choice with Capitalism.","slavery-abortion","01:32 AM","abortion-debates","131"

Well considering I never said what you fabricated, you're asking the wrong person. Perhaps you have confused me with someone else. Fetuses do exist. All existing cells have age. Since fetuses are at least several hundred billion cells, they must have age.
