All who are for abortion need to open their eyes and see the trend here.... You are acting just like the slave traders who said ""if we take away slavery, we wont be able to live on our plantations anymore and the cotton industry will be leveled"".... A similar statment now would be ""If i have a baby, my life will not be the way i want it to be and i will not be able to finance the baby""....

"01-31-2007","9510",1,"None","None","None","chloe","249124","Yeah, there are many similarities between abortion and slavery. Traces of the days of slavery are still present with us today in the form racism. This racism is perhaps seen most clearly today in abortion. The abortion movement preys upon minority communities. Check out this website: http://www.blackgenocide.org/ ""Planned Parenthood is the largest abortion provider in America. 78% of their clinics are in minority communities. Blacks make up 12% of the population, but 35% of the abortions in America. Are we being targeted? Isn't that genocide? We are the only minority in America that is on the decline in population. If the current trend continues, by 2038 the black vote will be insignificant. Did you know that the founder of Planned Parenthood, Margaret Sanger, was a devout racist who created the Negro Project designed to sterilize unknowing black women and others she deemed as undesirables of society? The founder of Planned Parenthood said, ""Colored people are like human weeds and are to be exterminated."" Is her vision being fulfilled today?""","slavery-abortion","11:30 PM","abortion-debates","2"

There are logical similarities between some of the arguments justifying slavery and arguments justifying abortion. These similarities are perhaps most evident in the two corresponding SCOTUS decisions in Dred Scott v. Sandford and Roe v. Wade. Both of these cases used the illegitimate doctrine of substantive due process, and in the process, substituted what the Constitution really says with what the Justices wanted it to say.","slavery-abortion","11:33 PM","abortion-debates","3"

"02-01-2007","9510",1,"None","None","None","VTCruiser","249166","just another fact as well posted by the Holocaust Museum in D.C.'s website. "" [G]enocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: * Killing members of the group; * Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; * Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; * Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; * Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group."" Seems to me that the founder of planned parenthood is guilty of these crimes.","slavery-abortion","10:10 AM","abortion-debates","5"

Pro-choicers do not advocate the abortion of fetuses. Anti-choice antics are getting pretty dirty these days. On the contrary, the Pro-lifers are acting like the slave traders. Anyone who denies a human being a fundamental human right because of a physical feature is more like the slave traders than everything. Let me also remind you that black people were sentient. Fetuses are not. Because they don't know any better. Besides, how many unwanted pregnancies have you had? How many abortions? Notice that most anti-choicers are men, which exposes the true hypocrisy in this dogma of thinking.","slavery-abortion","11:59 PM","abortion-debates","8"

An argument made for slavery was that ""you don't have to own them but don't tell us what to do""..a fairly similar argument but doesn't show whether or not abortion is wrong just that some lines of thinking should be questioned.

"02-07-2007","9510",1,"None","None","None","Another opinion","250200","If you think abortion is like slavery, the main question to ask yourself is why was slavery wrong to begin with? I personally think slavery was wrong because I have great sympathy toward people who were forced against their will to work under horendous conditions for people who used utterly false arguements to support such exploitation (arguments about the innate inferiority of all African American's in inherent capability, and about God supporting the right of whites to own blacks as slaves). It is the suffering of slavery, coupled with the false reasons for that exploitation, that lie behind my abhorence of slavery. Neither of these reasons have anything to do with the abortion debate prior to the third trimester (before which there is no suffering).","slavery-abortion","03:43 PM","abortion-debates","15"
