The big difference between you and me is that you believe that protecting a ""woman's right"" takes precedence over the life of the fetus. With rare exception, I believe the opposite.","jitobear","103747","Aw - once again - trivialize the circumstances of women - I really think we have vastly different views of what resPect means.

"04-02-2005","4699",5,"zachvac","None","I'm not ok with it but in this scenario life would not be a right unless you and I came to an agreement to not kill each other. Then we would have a right to life but not before. So you call the death penalty abusing their rights? I could also say I was given the right to smoke pot, but until the government lets me, it's not a right. I can continue to say that these are only abuses on my rights but I doubt you'd listen What do you mean by recognized? They obviously did not recognize the majority of humanity's part in such rights. I ask you, how much US history and Law have you had? So you now think that these rights are alienable. Again, more contridictions. are these rights inalienable or alienable, you cannot argue that they are both at the same time! Realize your contridictions and straighten your logic out!","Steeeeve","103774","A right doesn't mean someone won't abuse it or try to enfridge upon it. I really challenge you to read the website I posted. It really shows how government is not the creator of rights. This was a statement for chloe....and let me say, you said that to the wrong person . I believe you need to understand that just because something is inalienable does not mean it can't be ""stepped"" on. Inalienable means that these rights cannot be taken away. If you are murdered you still have the right it was just stepped on(so to speak). It is a right no matter if you have a government or not.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","11:16 PM","abortion-debates","63"
"04-02-2005","4699",5,"None","None","None","zachvac","103778","I'm sorry I know I have said I don't particularly like having to get a definition in a debate, but people seem to not know what a right is. I searched google definitions (define: right) and dictionary.com and got: (first one from google) an abstract idea of that which is due to a person or governmental body by law or tradition or nature; ""they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights""; ""Certain rights can never be granted to the government but must be kept in the hands of the people""- Eleanor Roosevelt; ""a right is not something that somebody gives you; it is something that nobody can take away"" (second from google) the interest possessed by law or custom in some intangible thing; ""mineral rights""; ""film rights"" both are from the princeton definition This is the relevent information from dictionary.com Something that is due to a person or governmental body by law, tradition, or nature. Something, especially humane treatment, claimed to be due to animals by moral principle. Every single definition seems to say something about a government. Even the one that quotes the same quote you did says that rights are an abstract concept due by a governmental body.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","11:30 PM","abortion-debates","64"

Yet we clearly see our rights ARE alienable. A inalienable right cannot be removed whatsoever. Yet if the right is removed, then is it not inalienable no? Because...your right has been revoked. How is that inalienable?","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","12:50 AM","abortion-debates","65"
"04-03-2005","4699",5,"chloe","None","I STRONGLY disagree. I think i have shown it to be. The right to live is the cornerstone upon which all other rights rest upon. You remove that right and the house falls. You can't compare any other right with the right to life because it is of a different quality. if you are dead then you dont have any rights. You must exist and continue to exist in order to have any right and to continue to have any right. A gov must make it first priority to secure the right to continue to exist (right to life) in order to secure any other rights. If someone takes another persons life they not only deny them their right to life, but also every other conceivable right. I would like to think that your right to continue to exist to post your opinions on this board (right to life) has more value than my right to liberty, happiness and my right to life has more value than your right to liberty and if these rights were to ever conflict we would both continue to live another day to argue. i do think you are wrong on this one sigma (and all who agree with sigma), and it wont hurt my feelings if you admit it You are absolutely right. Banning abortions will not solve all of our problems, but it will further solidify and secure the right to life, and therefore better secure all other rights for all. I have heard this so many times and the statistics on this have been blown astronomically out of proportion. Planned parenthood pushed this propaganda. Ill back this statement up if you like. A culture of life is a culture where the right to life is viewed as the most fundamental of all rights. A culture where the dignity of life is held above the quality of life. Banning abortion would save over 1 mill human lives a year. However, abortion won't be banned unless there is FIRST a cultural shift. The shift must come first.","Sigma","103811","No, you have not. Here is your fundamental misunderstanding. ""right to life"" does not equal ""being alive"". You must be alive to exercise rights, this is true. However, you do not require a right to life. I answered this in the other thread, so I won't repeat myself. No, it will not. The right to life will not be affected, nor will any other right. Yes, please do. Given that no-one, not even planned parenthood, know exact statistics regarding the number of illegal abortions (since they were not tracked), I would like to know where you are getting your numbers. No pro-life sites, please, they have no credibility. I see. It is a culture that agrees with your ideology. Where is the dignity in forcing women by law to continue their pregnancies and give birth against their will? If the cultural shift I envision comes, there will be no need to ban abortion because they will not be desired. Banning abortion now will do more harm than good and banning it then will make little to no difference. Banning abortion just does not make sense .","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","04:27 AM","abortion-debates","67"
"04-03-2005","4699",5,"None","None","None","Mach","103829","Chloe: Unfortunately, your premise is a document that has no legal relevance in the United States. It's a zinger to the world that we don't like the idea of monarchies, but more relevantly, that the King of England didn't have the right to rule subjects without their consent, etc. In reality, we have a constitution in the United States, which itself can also be changed. This is why the constitution is not the same as the declaration of independance. It's different, both in wording, and legal relevance. If you have an argument that has the premise rooted in the constitution, without any reference to gods, or the declaration, I'd like you to post it, having some more logic-driven debates on a hot-topic are always a good thing, in this case it's logic-driven, just with a flawed premise. In the end your entire argument fails because it's essentially an appeal to authority, that is, the authority of our forefathers as thinkers (which some indeed were). An argument needs to stand on the basis of sound logic and reason alone, not be rooted in the thoughts and ideas of some other person. Can we challenge the declaration? Not only can we not discuss the philosophy with the original writers to see what they, themsleves, intended and meant, but it's entirely irrelevant since our actual rights and our government, are not linked to the declaration in any way. Indeed, our forefathers worded things quite differently in the Constitution, they must have, we assume, made the decision to word it the way they did, for good reason. So please, let's discuss documents that have legal relevance, because after all, you're talking about a legal issue, indeed, the right of woman choosing to have an abortion, which is legal under U.S. law. -Mach","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","10:06 AM","abortion-debates","68"
"04-03-2005","4699",5,"Steeeeve","None","commenting on this first...From zachvac...It says right there..Something DUE to a peson or governmental body by law, tradition, or NATURE...it says DUE to...not given by. You get the idea that a right that is infridged is the same thing as taken away and thus alienable. This is not the case. Lets say you get your wallet stolen...your right to property is not ""gone""..in fact you still have that right which is why the person goes to jail. Alienable means transferable to someone else. Your right to life cannot be transferred to someone else. However when one says ""unalienable rights endowed by the Creator"" this means ""unseperatable rights given (and only can be taken) by the Creator"" One can never take your right to life..this would mean transfer or giving a right to life to someone if you could. Since life can't be this is an ""unalienable right"". In the US the founding fathers believed this to be true and based almost everything on that. It is how the Constitution was formed, and many things like that .","zachvac","103841","But if it's not given than it's not a right. I'll discuss this later in the post. You are right in the wallet scenario but if the government didn't send the person to jail or attempt to get your wallet back than you wouldn't have that right to property. Then what about the death penalty? Why do we allow the death penalty if we have this inalienable right to life?","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","12:43 PM","abortion-debates","69"
"04-03-2005","4699",5,"Duo_Maxwell","None","Because...your right has been revoked. How is that inalienable?","Cone","103847","We clearly see that when someone is murdered, their right to life has not been revoked. The fact that the government punishes murderers testifies to the fact that one's right to life has not been revoked. If it had, there would be no consequences for murderers at any level. To revoke the right to life, the government itself would have to remove all protections of life, which includes punishment for those who take it.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","01:03 PM","abortion-debates","70"

I was endowed by my creator the right to make all important decisions in the country. It's the government's job to secure this right. Why aren't they doing it. This right was pre-existent of government. A right is just a concept. You can claim you have a right to life and I can claim I have the right to kill you. If there was no government you would have no rights (or in your terms you would have no security on these rights, they would be violated all the time). AGAIN I ASK ALL PEOPLE WHO THINK RIGHTS ARE UNALIENABLE: Why do we have the death penalty? I thought life was an unalienable right.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","02:14 PM","abortion-debates","74"
