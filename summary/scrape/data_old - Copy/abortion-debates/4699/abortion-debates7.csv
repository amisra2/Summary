"04-03-2005","4699",7,"None","None","None","Steeeeve","103903","also Clive, since this is about abortion, If government makes rights, then why did women fight for their ""right to do what they want to their bodies""? They don't have this right because government didn't give it to them. So why do they feel as if they are being wronged by not having this ""right""?","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","04:58 PM","abortion-debates","91"
"04-03-2005","4699",7,"Eddie","None","Rights are merely social constructs. There is nothing natural, alienable or divine about them. They are violated each and every day on this planet and the only thing that can try to impose these social constructs on a larger population is a vigerous government.","Cone","103904","If that's true, then if a society finds that a particular group of people are not human, then the government is justified in gathering them all up, sending them to centralized locations, and gassing them in mass numbers.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","04:59 PM","abortion-debates","92"
"04-03-2005","4699",7,"Cone","None","This right opposes the self-evident Truth that all Men are created equal, therefore this right does not (and never will, thank goodness) exist. Case Closed.","zachvac","103905","But I was endowed by my creator that right. Why does the fact that all Men are created equal come before my rights given by my creator? And this really doesn't go against that all Men are created equal (which is totally false by the way, many are created with missing limbs and some have diseases, mental or physical) because I was created equal but right now I'm better because my creator gave me that right.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","04:59 PM","abortion-debates","93"

When a women is raped she lost some rights...does that mean they are gone?? People can rape her from now on because she has lost her rights? NOOOO even without a government she would be ****** if someone raped her. Why would she be ****** if she didn't feel a natural right was violated?","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:01 PM","abortion-debates","94"
"04-03-2005","4699",7,"Steeeeve","None","Yes, to secure the right to life...like it says. I would rather just have people stop abortion though.","zachvac","103908","But you just finished making fun of liberals for looking to the government for protection. Can you say hypocrite?","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:01 PM","abortion-debates","95"
"04-03-2005","4699",7,"Steeeeve","None","As for the death penalty...why do you think the Pope was against it?","zachvac","103910","Wait, we're discussing American law and foundation and you bring up the Pope? Am I missing something or was he American?","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:03 PM","abortion-debates","96"

It is because we are equal..are you saying you are more of a person then someone with one leg? Are you saying you are more or less of a person then someone who is mentally retarded? If you are so certain that your creator gave you a right to do whatever you want then why arent you fighting for it?","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:04 PM","abortion-debates","97"

We are talking about the right to life....The right to life exists whether or not you are in America....it exists in space, France, and yes, even Italy","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:05 PM","abortion-debates","98"

Well, they can rape her unless something or someone prevent it. HEnce the enforcement. Ah, so she does not have rights without gov;t!

"04-03-2005","4699",7,"Cone","None","You have the right to life if you are a human being. Wherever you live, whatever government governs you, this right exists whether governments reject its existence or not. I argued that the Declaration of Independence merely recognized the existence of this right, not that it established it.","Eddie","103917","How does this ""right"" exist?","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:11 PM","abortion-debates","101"

"04-03-2005","4699",7,"None","None","None","Duo_Maxwell","103925","These very simple questions will end this debate as to whether rights are universal or government given. Does the ocean abide to your right to life as you drown? Does the avalanche abide to your right to liberty as you a trapped? Does the pack of hyenas abide to your right to property as the rob you of food?","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:20 PM","abortion-debates","105"
