"04-16-2005","4699",14,"Cone","None","Just because something is legal, does not make it morally right. If the U.S. had an Amendment which legalized murder, murder would be legal, but still morally wrong. So wrong is completely relative? Then how can you tell me that I am wrong about the Declaration of Independence being the motivating factor of abolition?","Mach","107966","Morality is relative, legality is not relative. Please understand the difference. No, you're not corresponding to reality, you are factually incorrect, your claim is false. You are not morally wrong, I believe, based on evidence, that you are logically incorrect. Morality is neither logic, nor law, yet you keep getting the two confused. Did natural laws exist and govern the world before humans existed to discover them? Certainly. If wrong is just relative, why should I take anything you say is wrong seriously?","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","02:39 AM","abortion-debates","196"

No, you're not corresponding to reality, you are factually incorrect, your claim is false. You are not morally wrong, I believe, based on evidence, that you are logically incorrect. Morality is neither logic, nor law, yet you keep getting the two confused. Morality (right vs wrong, a relative concept), and reality, that is, correspondance to reality i.e. true, or false. If what I say is true, it's objectively true, and anyone adhering to logic or reason accepts it as true. However, if I were to tell you that eating pork is ""wrong"", then it's just an opinion of mine, and does not necessarily have any meaning to you. If however I were to tell you eating uncooked pork increases your risk of developing paraistes, that would be correct, factual, true, all of these things. So yes, if I say something is true, and it can be verified as true, you should believe it to be true. If I offer an opinon about right vs wrong, it's just a relative term, there is no true or false. I hope that helps you understnad the definitions you are using. It's not a claim. It's an accepted definition, that is, a premise. Absolutes have nothing to do with this, it's a strawman introduced in an attempt to lead some novice into a logical contradiction. Truth has nothing to do with the word ""absolute"". All truths are falsifable, by definition, not absolute. Both your usage of the word, and the resulting logic is incorrect. Let's start with your proof that the concept of ""right"" and ""wrong"" exist, and are ""real"". Please provide the observable physical evidence for these existing things that are without a doubt, made of matter/energy like all existing things. Is ""right"" made of gold and ""wrong"" made of lead? Please, do enlighten us.","Cone","107995","Whoa there. I obviously agree that law and morality are not the same. However, morality is not relative. DISCLAIMER: I am in no way admitting to Mach's accusation that my claim is false. However, to make my point as clear as possible, I will assume that his false assertion is true. Mach, I've posed this to zachvac several times. When you say that my claim is false or logically incorrect, the only thing you may have proved (see disclaimer) is that my claim is false or logically incorrect. But why even bother pointing this out to me? Presmumably to get me to change from using bad logic to proper logic. But it will take more than showing my logic to be flawed to get me to start using proper logic. You must show me that using bad logic is a bad thing. No one has done this yet. Can you answer me this: is genocide intrinisically wrong. By genocide I mean the gathering of large numbers of people from one race, shipping them to centralized locations, and then gassing, burning, or starving them to death. Is this wrong? Who has accepted this definition? I obviously don't agree that all truths are falsifiable or, essentially, relative. Why, if we have truths that are not falsifiable, would we live according to truths that are? For example: If an absolute standard allows us to say genocide (see above definition) is intrinsically wrong, that is, wrong no matter the culture, time in history, or what the law says, why would we want to live according to a standard that does not allow us to say genocide is intrinsically wrong? I'm not even going to bother. Here's why: Why bother wasting my time posting evidence for something when I can't possibly be wrong about it. That is, if I am wrong, I can't know if that's a bad or good thing and if I'm right, I can't know if that's a good or a bad thing.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","10:22 AM","abortion-debates","197"

Second, the unborn are not granted rights. Third, the unborn, especially those aborted, would be a financial strain upon this country, and this world. Fourth, the aborted, if forced to be born, would likely be born into a parentage that did not want them. Fifth, we already have a large amount of children in foster homes and many waiting to be adopted. Sixth, our facilities for caring for thise children as a nation is not up to par with other countries.

What is this ""wrong"" you speak of duo? are you acknowledging the existance of some sort of universal absolute moral ethic? Very interesting. Aparently productivity and citizenship is a prerequisite for the right to life. If they are human beings they have rights. We have been through this before. Wow. All I have to say is . . . Wow. So lets pull the plug on all the baby boomers when they become the strain on the health care system. Also, according to this logic, everyone on welfare goes, everyone in the lower class goes. It makes sense though, this is the type of conclusion that comes when one does not place inherrent value upon human life. It is a logical conclusion to the naturalistic worldview, or any other worldview that does not place highest value upon all human life. This is bigotry at its finest. Disposing humans based upon their economic status. Cool. Why do you degrade these persons by saying they are not worthy of the same monetary value you are placing upon the unborn.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","04:42 PM","abortion-debates","198"

You simply are not being logical. That is, you're being illogical. I do not care if you claim logic is good or bad or neither, it's irrelevant. If you prefer to argue illogically, by all means, go ahead. Some in this society, and in other societies, don't accept illogical jabbering, some do. I'm one who does not. By all means, admit your debate discussion is illogical, I cannot force you to adopt logic as a means to knowledge, understanding, survival, and a life more conducive to constructive use of your own energy, and I don't care to. Your use of contradictions simply makes your arguement nonsensical, and if one believes that illogical arguments are pointless, would agree that the debate is over, you have no point. This doesn't need to be a ""bad"" thing, you can learn from your mistake certainly, or you can choose not to, or anything in between. Your choice of morality is realtive to you. Can you justify your morality? I suspect you cannot even do that. I can of course, justify mine, in case you're wondering.

I never gave you a worldview, nor have we discussed consequences. I think you'd be surprised to truly understand your own views on both, or mine. No. Logic has nothing to do with such relative terms. It most certainly does NOT mean the world has ""no meaning"", because ""meaning"" is a relative term, you get to choose it. YOU define what has, or doesn't have, meaning. YOU. You have a choice: Let someone else define what is right and wrong for you (slavery), or choose for yourself what is right and what is wrong (freedom). For you to decry slavery, then support slavery, should be revealing to you. Also note that the concept of right and wrong don't exist, they are relative to the human (in this case) discussing it. Right and wrong deals with behaviors. You are completely missing the fact that it is EXACTLY an individuals CHOICE that makes MEANING important, and makes right or wrong relavant. I will show you what I mean: Child molestation: You deem child molestation intrinsically wrong...that is, just becase. I might define child molestation as wrong because: 1. Children are very vulnerable to psychologic manipulation, quite likely to do something they don't really want to do. 2. Molested children often have psychological problems that last their entire life as a result from their experiences. 3. People molested at a young age have a statistiacally higher sucide rate than the control. 4. Parents are responsible for their children, and parents generally do not approve of any adult interacting with their child in a sexual way. 5. As reasonable adults, many of us want to make sure a child has time to develop into an adult, before being confronted with the difficulties and responsibilities that come with sex. 6. The risk of STDs isn't something a child can fully comprehend etc., etc., etc. ================= If you believe something is right, ""just because"", then I don't accept your beliefs. If you want instead to JUSTIFY your beliefs, you might make some headway. Does it really scare you to think YOU define the meaning of your own life? That should be freeing, you should rejoice in your freedom, and be proud when you follow your goals and dreams, and pursue the meaning that you attribute to your life. -Mach","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","01:49 AM","abortion-debates","202"

That is the consequence of your worldview. The consequence of mine is that an absolute standard gives us the ability to deem actions right or wrong no matter what the time period in history, what public opinion says, no matter what the culture, no matter what the law says. Thus genocide, for instance, is always wrong (that is, never right) in every circumstance, in every culture, in every time period in history, no matter what the law says. I have to disagree with your humanistic approach. Then why, Mach, are you trying to convince me that my definition of morality is wrong. Are you trying to enslave me by forcing me to accept your definition of morality thereby eliminating my own free choice? Interesting. As for me, I've freely chosen to follow an absolute standard. Good effort in trying to make it look like I support slavery. Ultimately unsuccessful, but good effort anyway. What if science suddenly found out that child molestaion actually benefitted children and society? What if there were no ill-effects from such abuse whatsoever? What if someone decides that the meaning of their whole life is to commit mass genocide? What if someone decides that the most meaningful thing they could contribute to society is to rid the world of the inferior race? Should they rejoice in their freedom and be proud when they accomplish these goals and dreams? Still yet, should we rejoice in their freedom, and be proud when they follow and accomplish these goals and dreams? Afterall, they are only pursuing the meaning that they attriubte to their life.

"04-17-2005","4699",14,"Mach","None","Because? Your argument is light on substance, your refuation is even lighter :/ How could it? What would have to change? NO!!! You get to choose. You form a society. You agree on what behaviors are punishable by law, you enforce those laws. In this way, if someone comitts mass genocide, and it's against the law (mass murder), there would be punishment (death penalty or life in prison). Effectively they would be removed from society, because they broke the law. You want to label them as ""wrong"". For what purpose? They are already punished, in some cases, killed, for their behavior. What purpose does your labeling their action ""an absolute wrong"" have to do with the reality of the way our society functions? Some people love breaking laws. Good for them, they will be punished just the same. Some people don't know they broke a law. Too bad, they are punished just the same. Some people feel guilty, some don't, some have red hair, some believe in mythology, some don't, some are the CEOs of huge corporations, some are homeless people. Laws and punishment seem to work, not sure why you disagree.","Cone","108231","I disagree with your humanistic approach because I see no way to place value on anything. You haven't even been able to tell me genocide is always wrong no matter the circumstance. Science at one time deemed one particular group of human beings as non-human beings. Why should I think science will never get something wrong again? I don't think you understand what I was trying to say. Essentially, what happens if a culture and society embrace, even condone and mandate, genocide? What happens if it's legal to gather large groups of people according to race, ship them off to centralized locations, and gas, burn, and starve them to death? In this society, people carrying out these actions would not be breaking the law. I say even still, this is wrong.

You can place value on anything YOU CHOOSE. You can place value on everything, or nothing. Go ahead, try it. It's easy, really, you can do it! Genoicide being wrong or not wrong, is a relative concept. If you think genocide is wrong, simply defend your claim with reasons. You might find that most people hold the same relative opinion. Fundamental misunderstanding of the world, and of science :/ All truths are falsifiable, and science (knowledge) is always open to being corrected. If you find an error, over time, it will be corrected and assimilated into the body of knowledge justified as true. You must also know that your position that something could ""always be right"", denies the notion of free will. I do understand exactly what you are saying, I'm trying to get you to understand it just a little further, I think it's important. If a society makes it legal to murder large groups of people, then a society makes it legal to murder large groups of people. This has happened in history, presumably many times, even in the good 'ole U.S.A. It has nothing to do with moral relativism! Read what you wrote ""I say even still this is wrong"". YOU SAY. That is 100%, irrefutably, a relative statement. TO YOU, it is wrong. And guess what, most reasonable people seem to agree with you, that is, they too hold the same view on the behavior of killing massive amounts of people for unjustifiable reasons (another relative term). Legality does not imply morality. Morality does not imply legality. Morality is relative. Legality is not.

What was their basis for this? Maybe I am taking what you said outta context but if free will and having an absolute right and wrong are too different things...one wouldn't prevent the other. However, Cone got that belief based on an absolute. There will always be difference of opinions...this doesn't disprove an absolute right and wrong. I believe I asked this somewhere else...If you have relative morals then what is the basis for deciding if something is right or wrong? Is it the majority? Is it what the government says? Is it what the courts say? Also, some laws are based on morality...such as the belief that killing is wrong...However if that morality is relative then we can get the case were killing is ok.
