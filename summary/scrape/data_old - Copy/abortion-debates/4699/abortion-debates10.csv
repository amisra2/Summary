IF a right is inalienable, no one but God can revoke it. Therefore, everything BUT God must abide to such a right. How can a right be inalienable if others do not abide to it? Can a right exist if no one is there to enforce it? Even still your argument is inane. It assumes one huge key pillar: that god exists. That is obviously not going to be proven any time soon. To base your argument off of something that has not been proven is the fallacy of begging the question. Therefore, before we consider it any further, you must explain why we should accept such a fallacious point. Personally, I'm more annoyed that I didn't spot that earlier rather then you using it. You still haven't dealt with the problem of recognizing and applying, but at least you've basically abandoned the part of your argument you have contridicted more times then anyone can count.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","09:27 PM","abortion-debates","136"

Our founding fathers were the ones who assumed this. And this is the foundation of all of our law. Though nature may violate ones rights, the one (natures God) who bestowed that right still recognizes that right. The founders recognized rights existed, and that they did not create them nor endow them. in fact, no human created or endowed them. therefore, no human can destroy or take them away. even if they violate, deny, disregard these rights, the rights will still be recognized by the one who created and endowed them. Actually, you assume one key pillar: that god does not exist, a position of faith. That is obviously going not going to be proven soon. You my friend are begging the question.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","09:50 PM","abortion-debates","139"
"04-03-2005","4699",10,"Steeeeve","None","If the ocean kills you it has killed you...not taken your right to life. note: I said taken your ""RIGHT TO LIFE"". You have unalienable rights...means the rights cannot be taken, given away, transferred. The RIGHT cannot be taken given away, nor transferred...Being killed in the ocean simply means the ocean killed you...The ocean didn't gain a ""Right to life""...Does that make sense now?","zachvac","104017","OK than abortion doesn't violate your right to life, it simply kills you, just as the death penalty and murder does. Being killed via abortion isn't a violation of life, you were just killed. Make sense to you now?","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","10:11 PM","abortion-debates","140"

The thing is, an embryo isn't a human yet, so even if humans did have the unalienable right to life, it still wouldn't apply to an embryo.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","10:31 PM","abortion-debates","142"

"04-04-2005","4699",10,"chloe","None","This document recognizes rights which are secured under the constitution.the premises rooted in the constitution are rooted in the principles found in the declaration. Our constitution was rooted in the thoughts and ideas of its writers as well.","Mach","104158","And... You're still left with the simple fact that the Declaration of Independance, the premise of your hierarchy of rhetoric, is not legally relevant to the government of the U.S. The constitution was written after the declaration. Had they wanted to include wording from the declaration, they could have, yet they didn't, did they? Your house of cards is built on a rhetorical slight of hand, trying to persuade by implying somehow that abortion being legal, which it is, in the U.S., right now, should not be allowed. TIP: Trying forming a reasoned argument without such a weak premise, else, your entire argument is just as flawed, which it is. Abortion is legal, for the right reasons. A conscious, human, U.S. citizen, has rights. Cells, without consciousnes, that are not citizens, do not have rights, are not individuals, and are not humans. You can jump up and down, and post irrelevant things such as the Dec. of Independance, but it doesn't boost your debate credibility. -Mach","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","04:59 PM","abortion-debates","146"

"04-04-2005","4699",10,"Steeeeve","None","They are synomyns thats is for sure. Are they the same word? No...I gave you the two defintions of it. If they are the same then why have two words for it. No two words mean the exact same thing...eventhough they might have insanly similiar defintions. The founders used Unalienable. a right not enforced is an...unenforced right. Why do you wish to measure a right? A right exits even if no one abides to it. For example the slaves had rights...but no one abided to it. Thus the whole reason why they were ****** off. No, your life is not the same as your right to life. This is shown by your example. Something can take your life but no one can take your right to life. A right is something due to... (in a brief sense of the word) An absolute principal. Some people say it is reason..however, reason only goes but so far...some say God, some say different things...more on this later","Duo_Maxwell","104165","*sigh* I refuse to be drawn into a semantic argument. They are the same word. Each means the other. If you have a problem with this, consult webster, not me. Since when did they have rights? you state they have rights yet they are not measured, are not respected, and are not enforced. So therefore these rights just exist somewhere where tanigble, empericial methods do not exist? That by itself invalides such a argument. You don't have to have rights to want better treatment. Flawed logic. What is the point of a right to life if it is not enforced? how do you prove that the right exists if it is not abided to? Yet if it is not due then it does not exist. Hence why rights only exist if they are enforced. Any argument based upon begging the question is fallacious. I don't care what Scalia says.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:15 PM","abortion-debates","149"
