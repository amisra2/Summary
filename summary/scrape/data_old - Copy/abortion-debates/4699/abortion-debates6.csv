"04-03-2005","4699",6,"Steeeeve","None","Wow, I couldn't help by die laughing when I read this....good stuff man. I am glad you see the light One should not look to the government for what they believe and what they should do. I think this is the basic difference between the right and the left.","zachvac","103859","And yet you are looking to the government to stop abortions.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","02:15 PM","abortion-debates","76"
"04-03-2005","4699",6,"jim's trucking","None","That's true, but I doubt it'll fly with this forum's liberals. They think the government should give you eveything, including a job.","Cone","103869","I understood this to be the case when I posted. However, as far as I'm concerned, what I said was fact not opinion, and therefore is not up for debate. The Declaration of Independence contains within it the principles we look to when establishing our government. It cannot be improved upon, and I challenge anyone to try.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","02:43 PM","abortion-debates","78"
"04-03-2005","4699",6,"zachvac","None","OK, if that's true please refute this claim. I was endowed by my creator the right to make all important decisions in the country.","Cone","103870","This right opposes the self-evident Truth that all Men are created equal, therefore this right does not (and never will, thank goodness) exist. Case Closed.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","02:45 PM","abortion-debates","79"
"04-03-2005","4699",6,"Cone","None","This right opposes the self-evident Truth that all Men are created equal","Clive14","103879","This ""self-evident Truth"" is a fasical nonsense. People are not created equally, whether it be in the context of genetics, financial situation or social situation (or even plain geography), there is great inequality from birth onwards.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","03:40 PM","abortion-debates","80"
"04-03-2005","4699",6,"chloe","None","but it is. Straight from my molecular and cellular biology book: The dynamics of a cell can best be understood by examining the course of its life. A new cell arises when one cell divides or when two cells, like a sperm and an egg cell, fuse.","Clive14","103880","When you find a quote that supports your case, do get back to me. Until then, you lost the argument. Get over it. Bye now.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","03:42 PM","abortion-debates","81"

Besides that, your beef is not with me, its with the founders. As for me, I argue from the principles which they established. Without these, there is not United States.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","03:53 PM","abortion-debates","82"

You and chloe bang on about universal rights, then hide behind the opinions of a bunch of people from just one country. Now you could drop the ""universal"" gibberish and try to argue that the USA has a right to life, that cannot be taken away, built into its very foundations. But your argument would be hollow for your country has the death penalty.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","04:18 PM","abortion-debates","84"
"04-03-2005","4699",6,"Duo_Maxwell","None","Non-sense. Rights are given by the government.","Cone","103894","This is not what the Declaration of Independence says. If you don't agree with the Declaration of Independence, then you don't agree with the fundamental principles upon which the United States was founded.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","04:31 PM","abortion-debates","85"

Though the case can be made that the Declaration of Independence is founded on a universal authority.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","04:33 PM","abortion-debates","86"

It is virtually all a list of greviouness aganist the crown. Why is it that you are ignoring the vast majority of it to suit your argument? Besides the Declaration of Independence is irrevelant. it has no legal standing whatsoever. Also, rights are not merely limited to the US, which you and chloe seem to completely ignore while arguing univeral authority at the same time. If rights are truly universal, then they would exist outside the real of government documention and contracts. Yet neither of you seem willinging to discuss that. Why do I get the feeling that the opposition side has virtually no background in US law, and US history?","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","04:41 PM","abortion-debates","87"
"04-03-2005","4699",6,"None","None","None","Eddie","103899","Rights are merely social constructs. There is nothing natural, alienable or divine about them. They are violated each and every day on this planet and the only thing that can try to impose these social constructs on a larger population is a vigerous government.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","04:42 PM","abortion-debates","88"

Wherever you live, whatever government governs you, this right exists whether governments reject its existence or not. I argued that the Declaration of Independence merely recognized the existence of this right, not that it established it.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","04:54 PM","abortion-debates","89"
