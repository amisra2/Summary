"04-21-2005","4699",16,"Symbiote","None","Certainly abortions in the early stages of pregnancy don't involve active killing. Why else would you get an abortion? You are when you go to the hospital, because you have removed their feeding tube. If someone is eating out of your feeding tube and you cut them off, you are no murderer at all.","Cone","110302","I'm only gonna respond to the one's that were mine.... They don't? We're going to have to agree upon the question of when human life begins before this statement can be true. I'd like to see one pregnant woman withold her own recources from the fetus inside her without the aid of any secondary, outside resource. Because one is unwilling to accept the consequences of their own free choice. You were right to correct my comparison. However, your conclusion is incorrect. This action is still murder. Even if such a person was living off of my feeding tube without my consent, and someone removed it from them, it would still be murder.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","12:31 PM","abortion-debates","226"
"04-21-2005","4699",16,"Symbiote","None","Chloe, you are a murderer a thousand times over by your own definition of the term. You have passively murdered thousands of starving Africans whose lives you could have preserved. Have you? Abortion does not neccessarily include the killing of a fetus. The fetus always dies as a result, but it is not always killed. Perhaps you're too hysterical to be able to distinguish that fine a detail. Why do you think you can take the high ground on the issue of abortion, when you admit you yourself are a murderer of a large number of adults?","chloe","110332","Symbiote, While you claim that humans have a right to not have their life taken, at the same time you have undermined this claim with a qualification that says this right depends upon whether another human chooses to recognize this right or not. This leads me to conclude that you do not place an inherent absolute value upon human life. Furthermore, you cannot compare the right to life ie:the right for one to continue in their existence - to continue living - with any other right. Even this perceived right you have given to conflict with the right to life derives itself from the right to life. What do you know of my efforts to preserve and save human life? This comparison is not legitimate (although I see how you took my statement here). Let me further clarify it, murder involves the intent to end life. Abortion (whether carried out by a passive or active means) requires an active choice and intent to end the baby's life. One can intentionally end life through passive or active means. I have never actively or purposefully chosen to end anyone's life through any means (be it the starving or the babies or the starving of the babies). However... you can go ahead and say I am guilty of manslaughter which is true of most of the human race throughout the history of the world on many levels. I admit that I am guilty of manslaughter with the issue of abortion (i have not personally been involved in an abortion). yes i have. How is this so? I am referring to abortion where the mother actively chooses to end the life of the fetus (whether that be by a passive or active means). huh? How and why do they die? never said that. See above.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","01:16 PM","abortion-debates","227"
"04-21-2005","4699",16,"None","None","None","Linus","110343","Cone How do we determine that the person in a coma has an interest in living? I might not understand exactly what you are trying to say. Because the before the person was a in coma they were alivewillfully. But then again, a person in a coma isnt exactly occupying someones uterus either. If so, what are we to with those who express no interest to live? Depends on the nature of their interest. Are we talking about people who are incapable of it (I.e. fetuses, brain dead) or those who willfully choose to die? Further still, what are we to do with those who have expressed the opposite interest, such as people who overdose on drugs with the intent to kill themselves, people who wish to commit suicide in other ways, etc. People give themselves self-inflicted deaths kill ever day by exposing themselves to alcohol, drugs, high-fatty diets, radiation, being susceptible to everyday household poisons, risky behaviors and etc.. If someone wants to take heroin until they flatline I see it no differently then someone who makes a habit out of eating a big Mac thrice a week. However people who want to die should be judged upon their health firstjust like any other major decision. Would infanticide offend the live born infant? Even at one day old? Absolutely. I obviously disagree. My worldview places the highest value upon human life, and as such, a human person's right to life takes precedent over many other rights. A persons right to life does not supercede all other rights. If it did we would never have to pay a single cent in hospital bills. Considering your world view I suppose you have a friendlier feeling for socialized healthcare. This is a far cry from actually having an interest in life. Having the ability to have an interest, and actually having an interest are two separate and distinct propositions. They are because having an interest in life is an individual condition, being capable is universal for all of those who are mentally handicap. Does having emotions prove that one has an interest in life? Well, in order for you to enjoy and cherish something you would need them.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","01:50 PM","abortion-debates","228"

If a woman has excellent access to an abortion provider then I don't see why first-trimester abortions should be the only time where anyone can attain one free of reason. However this isn't Western Europe and there are many obstructionists who block/confuse women who try to practice their right to abortion. I would say a clear and logical time to end unrestricted access to abortion would be till the 25th week...when the fetus becomes clinically alive. However no woman should have to wait or be delayed from having an early abortion. When we start going into the second trimester the procedure doesn't become routine and complications become a possibility.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","02:01 PM","abortion-debates","230"
"04-21-2005","4699",16,"None","None","None","Linus","110347","Symbiote The ""right to life"", as in the one important in American tradition, refers to the right to not have your life taken, not the right to have your life supported by others against their will. Really? Abortion was legal in early America during the time of our founding fathers. The right to abortion appears to be more traditional and fetal rights are alien, judging from a traditional viewpoint of course.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","02:03 PM","abortion-debates","231"

Anyway, do you have a ""right to free healthcare""? I will go ahead and say this. Just because a person/society/government does not recognize a right or the value of the right does not mean they do not exist. The baby's right to life is violated when we abort it, but this does not negate the fact that they had a right to life. many systems are set in place for these types of provisions because there is a right to life and the systems are a means of securing this right so that all other rights can then best be secured. no they can't deny you. nor should they be able to. if you have sex you are ethically obligated to continue to regognize and not violate the right to life of the baby that may be created as a result - regardless of its size, its level of dependence, its location, or its environment. the government has systems set in place to provide for the needy. this is an effort to secure the right to life so that all other rights can better be secured. yes there is. of all other rights are to be secured, the right to life is must necessarily be secured in order for the other rights to be best secured. The right to life provides the basis for all other rights. no it doesn't. how? How can the right to life justifiably take a back seat to rights that have less value and logical precedence.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","03:08 PM","abortion-debates","232"
"04-21-2005","4699",16,"None","None","None","Linus","110368","I don't understand what your point is here. I think the concept is alien to you. If everyone has the right to be alive and continued as such then we need to establish institutions that grant accordingly to this right; free healthcare, food, shelter and outright criminalization of war and the death penalty. Guns would probably be banned too because shooting someone who might rape you could infringe on their right to life. many systems are set in place for these types of provisions because there is a right to life and the systems are a means of securing this right so that all other rights can then best be secured. So then why do I have to pay for food, shelter and safety then if I have such a right? If I really had a right to life then all of these would be freely provided. So far they arent and nor does the pro-life movement beckon for them to be provided as such. no they can't deny you. nor should they be able to. Theyll charge me. Hence healthcare isnt free and not a right. In certain states like Texas, a hospital can pull the plug on you if you cant afford the bills. if you have sex you are ethically obligated to continue to regognize and not violate the right to life of the baby that may be created as a result - regardless of its size, its level of dependence, its location, or its environment. And what if you are raped? I guess no obligation at all, huh? What if the baby doesnt have the blood type of its mother? Can I force strangers to donate their blood, tissue and organs because my right to life triumphs over their rights to their bodies? It does for a fetus and hence it should for me.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","03:35 PM","abortion-debates","233"

Your right to life doesn't say you have free healthcare and it doesnt say you get a kidney if you are dieing and it doesn't force people to give blood. If you want reasons why this is true just read back in some of the forums or maybe my posts (and cones for that matter). It has no backing for the simple reason that not donating blood is not an infridgement....not that this matters as making abortions illegal wouldnt force anyone to give blood. Your shelter things applies the same way.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:13 PM","abortion-debates","235"

Just because they had it before, doesn't mean they have it now. Judging from your criteria, it would not be an offense to a coma patient if we killed them. This answers nothing. Let me try to be more clear. If a person intentionally overdoses, thereby showing their intent to die, is it an offense against that person if medical personel to give life-preserving care to that person? How can a one day old infant have/express an interest to live? Having the capability is not the same as actually having it. Let me show you. A fetus has the capability to have an interest in life.

"04-21-2005","4699",16,"Symbiote","None","The ""intent"" factor is a red-herring. A woman may not ""intend"" to kill the fetus, she may simply ""intend"" to end her pregnancy, and the fetus' death may be an unfortunate, but definite, side effect. There is no way around this, unless you claim to mind-read every aborter, and claim that there ""intent"" is to kill. You cannot read their minds, and so you cannot know what their motive is. This is Communistic in two senses a) Asserting everyone has some right to be kept alive at other peoples' expense. You can't remove your own feeding tube from someone else. Someone else is taking your stuff - but if they need it - you aren't allowed to stop them. We can call this ""To each according to their need, from each according to their ability. Asserting peoples' thoughts can make them criminals. ie, advocating the criminilization of thought out of line with the Party's.","Cone","110623","As I said before, I'd like to see a woman ""end"" her pregnancy without any outside aid. Placing flowerly language on an action does not in any way soften its ethical implication. see above. I subscribe to the principle that all human life is sacred. Therefore I believe that the fetus has as much of a right to live as an infant. I don't believe I ever did this, but if you can make the accusation stick, I'll respond to it.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","10:21 PM","abortion-debates","240"
