"04-04-2005","4699",11,"Mach","None","You're still left with the simple fact that the Declaration of Independance, the premise of your hierarchy of rhetoric, is not legally relevant to the government of the U.S. The constitution was written after the declaration. Had they wanted to include wording from the declaration, they could have, yet they didn't, did they?","Cone","104212","I wonder why, since the Declaration of Independence has no relevance in American law, it was the document Abraham Lincoln and all the abolitionists pointed to as the reason slavery should be abolished. Seeing how the Constitution actually protected slavery, there was no way to declare slavery unconstitutional. I wonder why the Declaration was referred to as the ""organic law of our Union, standing above the Constitution itself"" by those fighting against slavery. Were they wrong? I would like someone to find for me in the Constitution, without using the 3 slavery amendments (13, 14, and 15), that slavery is wrong.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","08:25 PM","abortion-debates","151"

The decision to fight for slave rights was based on a moral decision that it was wrong, not on any law. It would be much like any argument for animal rights laws. No laws on it but you can create laws on it.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","10:17 PM","abortion-debates","152"
"04-04-2005","4699",11,"Steeeeve","None","If we take your view on rights then this right was created in 1973 outta no where and thus could be reversed again...and once reversed no one could claim a rights violation. If we take my view, then the right never existed and even if it did the right to life would trump it. This shows a lack of hearing other points of view...which begs the question why are we even talking to you.","Duo_Maxwell","104266","Exactly. I don't see why not. Rights only exist if they are enforced. Well, considering that no one has proven rights exist outside of goverment, then we could say with the same credibility that the right to abort is just as fundemental as property. Considering that your side keeps refering to US law that doesn't exist and is basically making up US history, the same question goes to you. It's like arguing with one who doesn't understand legal systems or history while trying to justify their arguments on that. It's ludacrious. There isn't a single thing any of you have said that would indicate you understand law or much of US history. Cone's outright ridiculous, and wrong argument about law and slavery is a perfect example.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","11:28 PM","abortion-debates","153"

The moral decision to abolish slavery was not simply made up, but represented a principled decision. Where did the principles come from?

"04-05-2005","4699",11,"Steeeeve","None","Then why were they complaing of ""civil rights"" violations in the 60s and what not? Why was there a claim in Roe vs Wade of rights being violated...Why do gays claim their right to marry is being violated? I don't think you have shown anywhere where I ""made up"" history. Not only that, you don't even argue the point that you don't listen. So why should anyone trust you when you don't even take the time to listen to someone elses point of you...NOT EVEN A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE!... You think maybe he knows more about law than you? Cone gets many of his arguements from writtings of the founding fathers and some judges....atleast I believe he does (considering they are similiar).","Duo_Maxwell","104428","Because they want a right to be enforced by the goverment. Do such actions exist outside of govermnet? Not to mention these groups pander to such illogical notions that a fair amount of people believe. Where was that? Cone is a perfect example of making Us history up. not to metion all three of you seem to think that the DOI has any real impact on the legal system whatsoever. That by itself is revisionist US history. the DOI doesn't do anything today except look there and try to be pretty. Please tell me why I should listen to someone who wants to bring US law into the same light as Divine law. Cone makes things up. zachvac proved that with his slavery idea. Does it bother you none of you have been able to prove empiricially that rights exist outside of goverment?","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","12:22 PM","abortion-debates","156"

This is not revisionist history, but solid fact. You have yet to even address this claim. If you don't agree with my statement, why don't you try to disprove it with factual evidence instead of simply accusing me of making up history (which is a nice way of calling me a liar).","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","12:48 PM","abortion-debates","157"

It's a long list of why the crown is a pain to deal with. How is the consitution based upon a list of greviouness? I mentioned that at least 4 times before and none of you have dealt with it. Not to mention I have already given examples of where it was not applied after the signing, namely slave owning signers. On the contrary, I have already dealt with it. Your party needs to deal with the rebuttal. It's not my fault your side uses repetition to deal with refuted arguments. I already dealt with the silly notion of the DOI.

I am unaware of any rebuttal not attended to. Try the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments. If that's not impact upon the legal system, I don't know what is. Just so I am perfectly clear in what I mean, the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments came to be because there was a perceived violation of the Declaration of Independence.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","08:35 PM","abortion-debates","160"

It's simply not a reason, it's just an action. IF the words and phrases there, represent your own ideas on the matter, feel free to quote it, use it, refer to it, frame it, or make sweet love to it. BUT Don't assume reasonable people will somehow accept it as basis, or backing, for an argument, when it's nothing more than an appeal to authority, or an irrelevant historical document. You still aren't getting it. Even the constitution, an actual legally relevant document, indeed, possibly the most relevant in the U.S. IS JUST A DOCUMENT. What it says, and the implications MUST make sense, and be justified, or they are ammended, or completely rejected. Luckily, our forefathers seem to have made a document that has required some change, but overall makes sense. But either way, the document's authority is only as good as those who defend it, with REASONS, and EVIDENCE, to support their case. Additionally, the dec. doesn't mention cells or fetuses, or abortion, even though the dec. is basically irrelevant, it's also irrelevant even if it's read with reference to this subject. Debate abortion on reasons and evidence..i.e. from reality, rather than referring to some old document (dogma). -Mach","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:22 PM","abortion-debates","162"

Zach (correct me if I'm wrong), is claiming that the decision to abolish slavery was made because people reasoned, thank the smart ones and the slaves for pointing it out, that treating some people like property is not a good thing. I'm sure they had a list of reasons why being kept captive, as property, as a living, breathing, adult, is inhumane, not acceptable, against freedom/liberty/happiness, unethical, un-christian, you name it. Their reasons were likely many, and varied. But ultimately it comes down to justifying that indeed, humans as slaves is not something our government should allow. Some rhetoric may have been used in the public speeches to the press, quoting a famous document (FYI, that's marketing 101), but this is not why slavery is wrong. Slavery is not ""wrong"" because it ""seems"" to be contrary to the wishes of our freaking founders. It's wrong because we as individuals, LIKE our indivuality and freedom, and as a society, agree to grant that freedom to EVERYONE. NOT BECAUSE OF A DOCUMENT. -Mach","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:27 PM","abortion-debates","163"

Where in the DOI does it mention slavery? The decision to abolish slavery was made up. If it were in the DOI (which it's not) then that's when they would have made it up. All human morals are made up. They just decided that slavery was bad (just as they could decide that forcing a women to undergo pregnancy is wrong) and decided to ban it (just as they could ban abortion).","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:33 PM","abortion-debates","164"

I disagree with you and would like your proof. You used slavery which I rebuted in my post right before this one. The declaration was a document that when written all the authors thought they would be hanged for treason.
