Rights are not simply just passed out but are based upon interestsomething the Supreme Court based their conclusion during Roe v Wade. In the many years that have supported abortion rights I have never found a single pro-lifer who could prove, outside their opinion and others, how a fetus has an interest in being born. Unfortunately for them, fetuses have never elected pro-lifers to speak their behalf of but instead vice-versa. The pro-life movement plays as a self-appointed representative towards fetuses despite a lack of evidence or substance as to why a fetus, at the moment of conception, has an interest in living.

For nearly 70 years we know that the fruits of coercion childbirth do not payoffthey lead to the corruption of law enforcement, provide criminals another avenue of wealth, wreck death and mutilation upon desperate women, destroy the healthcare system and leave behind an underground abortion rate that is rarely addressed by those who support coercion childbirth in the first place. Fetuses are immune from having an self-interest in being born because they have never developed such feelings in the sheer majority of abortion ever performed. Their brains are often far too primitive to hold such emotions or even awareness. If the fetus is incapable of feeling outraged or offended by being aborted then what is the big deal?

"04-21-2005","4699",15,"None","None","None","Linus","110138","""As in 50% of Americans????"" 50% of what? That oppose abortion? Think again. More like 36% and I think 36% is a generous amount considering I am not deducting the amount of salad bar lifers either. http://www.publicagenda.com/issues/a...rtionRoeRF.jpg ""This was my favorite...I guess the Supreme Courts job is to decide what our country thinks is moral and not."" Not the job of the Supreme Court to create laws based upon morality but instead the Constitution. If you are opposed to this ideology in running a country maybe you should move to Iran...where laws are created by a group of moralists. Enjoy! ""Well, I can't prove that you have an interest to be alive right now."" You don't have to...I can do it all by myself. ""So since you don't believe pro-lifers should be the voice maybe we should ask the fetus..."" Why would you ask the fetus? Lifers do not care about what the fetus wants but instead what they think is best for the fetus. If the fetus wanted to kill itself would you allow that? Common pro-life ideology says you wouldn't and thus it proves you have no real interest whether the fetus wants to be alive or not. To suggest pro-lifers would is deceptive. ""...we first have to let it learn how to speak first..so by the point it is born and we can't kill it anyway. "" Fetuses don't speak, sorry. But then again neither do trash cans so maybe we should teach them to speak as well? Your typical first-trimester fetus cannot speak nor attain the emotion nor awareness to desire life. ""Not only that, who are you to say they DON'T have an interest in living??? I guess you are its appointed speaker now."" When did I say I speak for fetuses? I am only speaking for embryology. Do you have a problem with that? Women have a right to abortion because, as a nation, we have an invested interest in keeping abortion legal for them. For nearly 70 years we know that the fruits of coercion childbirth do not payoffthey lead to the corruption of law enforcement, provide criminals another avenue of wealth, wreck death and mutilation upon desperate women, destroy the healthcare system and leave behind an underground abortion rate that is rarely addressed by those who support coercion childbirth in the first place. ""I am sure you have proof for all of this. Even so, I guess this justifies killing someone."" Not at all...but abortion doesn't kill someone. ""I guess you could say the same thing about a mentally retarded person, alzheimers patients, 1 second old baby, a sleeping person (as they wouldn't know and therefore couldn't get outraged or offended)...."" No, you couldn't say the same at all. ""...I guess you define a person as being aware they don't wanna be killed."" I define a person based upon clinical signs of life. ""I recall some other people thinking the same thing in the 1930s"" Yeah and he was pro-life. Totally against abortion. Man, good to see you lifers are in good company with Hitler and Stalin. So much for the culture of life in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia! ""You are sadly mistaken there...It was illegal for about 200 years dude."" It is you who is mistaken. Abortion was only fully criminalized sometime in 1850...however it was a state-by-state campaign; not national. If you have a source which proves abortion has been illegal in America for 200 years...be my guest, really...I dare you. Because every textbook written about abortion laws here in America shows that abortion was perfectly legal until quickening by any mean and any way. Even Mohr, who wrote a classic on early abortion laws, supports this reality you choose to ignore. http://users.telerama.com/~jdehullu/abortion/abhist.htm","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","12:36 AM","abortion-debates","215"

Your claim is that one must have an interest in living in order to be able to have a right to life. Because the fetus doesn't have such an interest, we are justified in terminating it if we want to. But you have not proven that a mentally retarded person has an interest in living. Therefore by your standard, we are justified in killing a mentally retarded person if we want to. The same goes for someone in a coma, someone in heart or brain surgery, someone who is sleeping, and many many other people.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","12:52 AM","abortion-debates","217"

No, people in comas already have interest in lifeto distinguish their lives would violate themunless of course you can absolutely prove that people in comas permanently lose this. Your claim is that one must have an interest in living in order to be able to have a right to life. No, I claim that simply abortion doesnt offend the fetus because it is absent of interest in living. To suggest the right to life is solely based upon interest in living is an entirely different topic. There are many factors that go into proving why aborting a fetus is ethical and moral. No one has ever had a right to life that supercedes all other rights. Never. But you have not proven that a mentally retarded person has an interest in living. I am not sure what you trying to prove but you cannot prove a generalization that a collective group of people (based upon a handicap) have a single common interest. However the fact of the matter is that those who are mentally retarded have the ability to have an interest in life. If you seriously doubt then please provide evidence to the contrary. It is common knowledge that such people have emotions and your demand is no different then asking someone to prove that Jews are human beings. It is absurd. Therefore by your standard, we are justified in killing a mentally retarded person if we want to. The same goes for someone in a coma, someone in heart or brain surgery, someone who is sleeping, and many many other people. You are making a hasty post-hoc conclusion that is absent of base.

Are you saying that the person himself must have and interest in living. If so, what are we to with those who express no interest to live? Further still, what are we to do with those who have expressed the opposite interest, such as people who overdose on drugs with the intent to kill themselves, people who wish to commit suicide in other ways, etc. Would infanticide offend the live born infant? Even at one day old? I obviously disagree. My worldview places the highest value upon human life, and as such, a human person's right to life takes precedent over many other rights. This is a far cry from actually having an interest in life. Having the ability to have an interest, and actually having an interest are two separate and distinct propositions. I don't understand.

While you claim that humans have a right to not have their life taken, at the same time you have undermined this claim with a qualification that says this right depends upon wether another human chooses to recognize this right or not. This leads me to conclude that you do not place an inherrent absolute value upon human life. Furthurmore, you cannot compare the right to life ie:the right for one to continue in their existance - to continue living - with any other right. Even this perceived right you have given to conflict with the right to life derives itself from the right to life. No. ""Not, neccessarily""? Have you seen the abortion procedures!!!? Anyways, this type of politically correct language is used to ease the human conscience. Passive murder and active murder are no different. Human life is ended either way.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","12:05 PM","abortion-debates","223"
