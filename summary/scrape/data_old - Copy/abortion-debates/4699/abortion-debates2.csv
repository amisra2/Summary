"03-31-2005","4699",2,"chloe","None","i am talking specifically about their view of rights (right to life,liberty, pursuit of happiness) and their view of the puropose of gov that its purpose in society (ideally) was to sucure these rights. the constitution recognizes these rights. that is irrelevant to the argument about abortion. these rights exist whether gov recognizes them or not. the fact that slavery was abolished is a testimony to this. i feel you have missed the whole point of the essay","Duo_Maxwell","103238","No it doesn't. The consitution states that if you can only lose those ""rights"" with due process and a exchange. It doesn't say that you can't lose them at all. There is no right to the pursuit of happiness in the consitution. . Liberty can be taken away, as well as life. The consitution does not prevent capital punishment or incareration. Those rights alienble. Fallacy: changing the direction. You clearly stated they clearly viewed that these basic rights were transcendent and bestowed and that all of humanity possessed them . Yet that is obviously false. So what's so bad about denying a fetus rights if they did it to? After all, you're arguing that their beliefs should governor us now right? So if it was okay back then under their beliefs, why not now? That is your argument no? I feel you understand little about US law and US history.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:20 PM","abortion-debates","16"

The right to property can be considered to be the same as right to happiness. even if you don't see it that way, it doesnt change anything. the right to life is a fundamental right. it is the right of all rights. Of course these right can be taken away through power, but not without due process of law. Usually the reason that life is taken away is because the person took the right to life or (lives) from another. rights are taken away as punishment to the person who took rights away from another (broke the law). how so? they saw that we posessed TRANSCENDENT(absolute and unchanging) RIGHTS whether they were recognized or not. you just dont like the idea that they are transcendent or bestowed. you are still missing the point of the essay.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","05:33 PM","abortion-debates","18"

They do exist. The consitution does recognize them, but hardly makes them inalienable. On the contrary, it sets measures in which those rights can be taken away. Therefore, the declaration's inalienable rights idea is not a reality in the consitution, but the reverse is very much true. We CAN take those rights away under certain conditions, meaning the so called inalieble are very much alienable in our legal system. By who? Happiness is subjective. Also, the right to propery is not inalienable as well. If the state of feds want to take it from you, they can, but usually have to compenstate you for such a loss. You lose property, and it is perfectly legal. The writers did not as they did not apply them. Washington for example was a slave owner and contined to be a slave owner for long after the signing of the declaration. Fundemental? What do you mean by that? Under due process, that right can be removed. So by all means, that right is not fundemental. How can a slave owner say all of humanity possessed these rights yet deny them to women, minorities and slaves? Seems like humanity is either white, land owning men, or they simply did not believe in such a idea or believed it was not applicable at the time. All go contrary to your argument. What they SAID and what they DID are two very different things. I'm applying what they did. And what they did goes contrary to your argument. Please brush up on US law and US history before your next post.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","01:49 AM","abortion-debates","25"
"04-01-2005","4699",2,"chloe","None","no one disputes that human life begins at conception","Clive14","103413","Rubbish, there are many that argue otherwise. The life of twins can be viewed as starting at the moment the zygote/ embryo splits for example. The reality though is there is no single point at which a human life begins: the moment the egg and sperm form, the moment of conception, first division and implantation, the moment the heart starts to beat, the moment of birth etc all mark stages in the formation of a new life.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","10:30 AM","abortion-debates","26"

Instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop. If you dont like that example, consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","10:43 AM","abortion-debates","28"

The Constitution explains what form of government will best guard these rights. The purpose of a good government is to secure these rights for all of its citizens, and the reason those measures must be set in place is because these rights sometimes conflict. The reason they would be denied to someone by a government which exists to secure these rights for all of its citizens is because that person has taken rights from another by force. The government does this to punish the lawbreaker and better secure the rights of the other citizens. This keeps crooks off the streets who seek their happiness at the expense of other peoples more fundamental rights. Right, but life is not. That is why you cannot compare the two. Killing makes a killer happy, but it robs the victim of life. The right to continue to exist is necessary for all of the other rights. If you dont exist you dont have any other rights. The right to life cannot be compared to the right to freedom or happiness. This is an unequal comparison. Yes it is. The victimizer robbed the victim of all of the rights when he took the right to life. The right to life is a necessary right for all other rights to exist. There for it is a fundamental right. The slave owners had a wrong understanding of humanity. This doenst negate the fact that the slaves were endowed with rights by their creator. Just because a murderer doesnt think the victim has a right to life doesnt make it so. Those penning these documents were observers of these transcendent rights. What they did was wrong. This does not change the fact that certain inalienable rights exist of these being a fundamental right to life. This is how you are able to say that slavery was wrong. These guys just observed that the rights existed. They werent the ones who originated them. These rights were bestowed.","they-endowed-their-creator-certain-inailienable-rights","10:46 AM","abortion-debates","29"
