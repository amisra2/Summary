How would like to be required to submit to a prostate exam and provide a semen sample before you could buy condoms?","gansao","449609","Why shouldnt she see what she legally elects to terminate ? Condoms are a contraceptive not a termination. If I was the one that was legally obliged to make the decision to terminate a fetus then yes I should ( or at least I see no reason to) encounter the thing that I have elected to destroy..even if that meant a finger up the arse.( not sure about your implication of a semen sample...the vaginal ultrasound test does not require a female orgasm )","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","06:22 PM","abortion-debates","16"

Pro abortionists have been trying to redefine the fetus as a parasite on this very forum..and this is why. Whatever the fetus is the procedure is not rape...which Simone and Sinjin would have us believe. Termination is not a procedure for a cure of an illness or medical disorder.Pregnancy is not an illness","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","05:49 AM","abortion-debates","24"

It looks to me that transvaginal ultrasound is simply a better method of obtaining an image and certainly doesnt constitute rape","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","09:11 AM","abortion-debates","26"

I'm curious about whether or not ""forcing"" something is really the criteria we have for it being bad or is it just not a convincing reason for the force that makes the law bad (to those that oppose that is). If the latter I'm curious about what the standard is for when we can force versus not force.

Sonography is extreme safe and the persons performing the procedures are trained to be as helpful to the patients as possible. Who really thinks that a medical professional doing a procedure that a person has come in for constitutes rape? Perhaps it's time to stop the blatant lie that this is rape and actually present a real argument.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","10:37 AM","abortion-debates","28"

I have difficulty with the concept of coercive rape but penetration with consent obtained through threats or coercion comes very close to rape IMO.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","11:24 AM","abortion-debates","30"
