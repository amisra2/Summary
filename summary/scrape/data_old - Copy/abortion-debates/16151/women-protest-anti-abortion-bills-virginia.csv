None, that's what.","gansao","449594","Then why are they obliged too? And its not really rape is it? Transvaginal ultrasound is a imaging technique used to create a picture of the genital tract in women. The hand-held device that produces the ultrasound waves is inserted directly into the vagina, close to the pelvic structures, thus often producing a clearer and less distorted image than obtained through transabdominal ultrasound technology, where the probe is located externally on the skin of the abdomen. Purpose Transvaginal ultrasound can used to evaluate problems or abnormalities of the female genital tract. It may provide more accurate information than transabdominal ultrasound for women who are obese, for women who are being evaluated or treated for infertility, or for women who have difficulty keeping a full bladder. However, it does provide a view of a smaller area than the transabdominal ultrasound.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","05:16 PM","abortion-debates","11"

I personally do not know of other medical procedures that are required by LAW to be performed on a person - especially none that do so for non-medical reasons. This would be negative on two fronts: 1) It would set a dangerous precedent for politicians to force un-necessary medical procedures purely for political reasons. 2) It is a highly invasive medically-unnecessary procedure that, in being forced upon a woman, is highly intrucive into her personal freedom. Because of issues such as this, I find Republican rhetoric about the Democrats' invasion of freedom as being utterly ridiculous and hipocritical. Republicans don't only want a smaller government - they want a government small enough to fit into our bedrooms... Either way, my understanding is that the bill has already been changed since there was such an outcry against requiring such a procedure. The governor, a fairly moderate Republican, said he would veto the law in that form so, apparently, the state legislature did change it to a version which required only the normal external ultrasound (which is typically done in abortions anyway). Even in this form, I object to the law since medical procedures should not be mandated by law.
