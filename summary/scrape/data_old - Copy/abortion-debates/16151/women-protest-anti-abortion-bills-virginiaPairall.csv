"02-21-2012",1,"16151","11","sinjin","449593","What is the medical reason one would need a transvaginal ultrasound before an abortion procedure? None, that's what.","gansao","449594","Then why are they obliged too? And its not really rape is it? Transvaginal ultrasound is a imaging technique used to create a picture of the genital tract in women. The hand-held device that produces the ultrasound waves is inserted directly into the vagina, close to the pelvic structures, thus often producing a clearer and less distorted image than obtained through transabdominal ultrasound technology, where the probe is located externally on the skin of the abdomen. Purpose Transvaginal ultrasound can used to evaluate problems or abnormalities of the female genital tract. It may provide more accurate information than transabdominal ultrasound for women who are obese, for women who are being evaluated or treated for infertility, or for women who have difficulty keeping a full bladder. However, it does provide a view of a smaller area than the transabdominal ultrasound.","women-protest-anti-abortion-bills-virginia","05:16 PM","abortion-debates","152"

You need to try harder than than Even if it was a requirement to provide a sperm sample and submit to a prostate examination before I could but condoms I would still have a choice( unlike your child) I would not be forced to do anything and it cetainly would not be tantamount to rape If after buying condoms a finger was forcibly thrust into my rectum and after that I was locked in a room with a dirty mag and told not to come out without a sperm sample then I could say that I was forced to do these things. That is why I object to the word force as well as the word rape..both are incorrect and dishonest. They suggest coercion and helplessness when none exist( except in your case).

There may be no ' medical' reason to terminate the fetus I take it you have no argument so you chose to insult me instead While its early? So how would looking at an image of an 'early' fetus coercion. You want the fetus to be seen as a liability , something of no importance because it suits your agenda of abortion on demand.It has nothing to do with womens rights, instead it has everything to do with the notion that the fetus should be given no rights.
