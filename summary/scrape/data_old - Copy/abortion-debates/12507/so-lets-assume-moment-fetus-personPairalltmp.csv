"","04-13-2009","12507","Another opinion","349398","Presumably, they added the fourth definition ( a human fetus) because Pro-Life advocates call fetuses children. Once again, you have demonstrated your lack of knowledge in how to use dictionaries. Either that, or you are purposely being dishonest. Go ahead and call fetuses children, if you like, but the very dictionary that you quoted supports the pro-choice view that most people don't use the term ""child"" in that manner. You have once again shown why you lack credibility in any issue involving the use of dictionary terms since you obviously either (1) don't know how to use them or (2) purposely distort them. Any experienced reader is going to see right through your games, and those of us on the pro-choice side will make sure to reveal these games of yours to those readers who are not experienced enough to recognize such games for themselves. You will not win the debate by destorting definitions, try as you will.","Steeeeve","349404","You are being dishonest as well. You committed a huge fallacy here. Another fallacy. It doesn't support that at all. It only supports the idea that child is used more often in one sense than the other. It DOES NOT indicate that many people don't feel that is a proper use of the word or don't use it in ""that manner"". So have you For someone who claims to be about logic you did a number of distortions yourself. I've debated you many times and this is not your style..what gives?","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","abortion-debates","49","04:42 PM"
"","04-13-2009","12507","Another opinion","349415","What, specifically, do you claim my fallacy is - that I presumed that they put ""human fetus"" as one definition since pro-life people use it that way? You may note that I used the word ""presumably"" which means that I was making a reasonable guess as to the reason that the dictionary defined child in that fashion. I did not claim it based on absolute logic. According to the dictionary, the term ""child"" is most often used for human beings after birth since, in dictionaries, the first definitions listed generally show the most common useage of a word, with definitions farther down the list showing less common useage. If the same word is used two different ways in the same context, that would mean that the first definition is the more common use of that word in the given context. Unless you claim that the first definition and the fourth refer to different contexts, then I don't see where you are claiming my falacy lies. Also, you should note that I never said that calling a fetus a child was an improper use according to the dictionary. I simply said that it was the less common use. Since Chuz Life seemed to imply that calling a fetus a child was THE official use, not the lesser of two, that is why I called him on it.","Steeeeve","349438","It's not even a reasonable assumption unless you have something indicating this. This is NOT what you said. You said: ""but the very dictionary that you quoted supports the pro-choice view that most people don't use the term ""child"" in that manner. "" This is a fallacy. Lets say 5 people exist and a word has two definitions. Each 4 of those people use this word in definition one more often than not. ALL four each use this word in definition number 2 but only in rare circumstances. So all four feel that both definitions are legitimate but it would show up in a dictionary as most used and least used even if all agree that it could mean both. Your sentence, in its context, implies people feel the last definition is not legitimate and therefore don't use it ""in that manner"". This may or may not be true but you certainly can't say it is true. It is either a fallacy or you poorly presented your position. You did not say this. See your quote above. If you were trying to say this you phrased this in a very condescending way. No, Chuz Life simply said that abortion results in the death of one child. The context of this clearly implies definition 4 from your link (or whoevers link it is). This is not a misuse of the term and I doubt people are getting confused thinking abortion results in a ""person between birth and full growth"" being killed...unless they don't know what abortion is.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","abortion-debates","62","06:58 PM"
"","04-13-2009","12507","Another opinion","349442","For you, an unfertilized egg magically becomes a person/human being/individual on being fertilized. You think a single cell is a person. I don't since I view that as absurd. The only compelling arguement that pro-life proponents ever come up with is that that single cell will BECOME something we value - one of us. The pro-life side then says that because it will BECOME a person, that means that it is ALREADY a person - a logical fallacy. If the zygote would stop its growth and forever stay a zygote, then why would rights even be relevant to it? After all, at that point in time, it is just a single human cell with ""nobody home"" - no mind, no experiences, no sense of pain, emotions, sense of self, no will, nothing. It is just one cell - a thing - an object. All of its worth lies in what it, under normal circumstances, WILL be. Not in what it IS.","Steeeeve","349447","If a 1 day old baby stopped growth it would seem to me to be more worthless than the zygote in terms of use. The argument of becoming something should be used in the context of relating to other stages of life we all agree are worthy of giving rights to. A newborn is growing into something that will be useful a zygote is too. An unfertilized egg will not. A 10yr old will grow into the something as well...and so on. I think this is the argument advanced and not that something growing is therefore a person.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","abortion-debates","67","07:23 PM"
"","04-13-2009","12507","Another opinion","349443","What you don't have is the right to reinterpret already existing laws based on your opinion. The laws that exist do not depend on your opinion but on their purposes at the time that they were written.","Steeeeve","349448","Then why aren't you an originalist? If you felt this way than Roe vs Wade to you should be laughed at.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","abortion-debates","68","07:25 PM"
"","04-14-2009","12507","Another opinion","349535","Why do you bring up the issue of usefulness? That was never a criteria that I brought up.","Steeeeve","349578","I substituted usefulness for this (in response): ""no mind, no experiences, no sense of pain, emotions, sense of self, no will, nothing"". I wasn't very clear about that...I couldn't think of a better term at the time.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","abortion-debates","79","04:37 PM"

Usefulness implies that it is useful to someone else. It doesn't matter to me at all whether anyone else can benefit from a person in order for me to think that person deserves rights.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","abortion-debates","81","05:34 PM"

I would still be interested in your answer, from the previous posts, about why the hypothetical zygote (that would stay forever a zygote) would need rights. Of what value or imporance are rights to an entity that can never experience the lack of rights? I didn't really follow your arguement at the time so I am hoping that you will elaborate.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","abortion-debates","87","02:33 PM"
