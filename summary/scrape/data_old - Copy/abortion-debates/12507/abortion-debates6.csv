"04-14-2009","12507",6,"Chuz Life","349541","For the reader's considerations; Matter of Baby K. 16 F.3d 590 (4th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 91, 130 L. Ed. 2d 42 (1994). Treatment of an anencephalic infant at parental request must be given by the hospital despite its seeming futility. Baby K was born without a cerebrum and thus permanently lacked consciousness. With only a functioning brainstem, she was expected to live briefly at most. After the second incident of respiratory distress, the hospital sought a court order to allow withholding of ventilator treatment against the mothers wishes. Although the biological father of Baby K agreed with the hospital, because he was not legally married to Baby Ks mother and only distantly involved in Baby Ks care, the mother was presumed to be the appropriate decision maker under common law and under both the U.S. and Virginia constitutions . Based on the principles of family autonomy and a presumption in favor of life, the trial court denied the hospitals request unless presented with clear and convincing evidence under Cruzan that to continue treatment would be child abuse or neglect. The appellate court affirmed the lower courts decision, because the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment even if hospital physicians considered such treatment morally and ethically inappropriate. Translation? Baby K, concious or not, capable or incapable of becoming so,... was a ""person"" in the eyes of the law.","Another opinion","349551","Only because she was already BORN. That point IS in the Constitution - i.e. that those born in the US or naturalized have the rights of citizens. During the writing of the revelant sections of the Constitution, such an baby would never have survived so the situation would never have been encountered. New technologies bring up new questions about rights - both at beginning of life and at end of life, and for life forms that are clones or hybrids. These are all problems that our founders never dreamed of since these are new questions that can be seriously brought up only because modern technologies make them possible.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","03:02 PM","abortion-debates","76"

"04-14-2009","12507",6,"Chuz Life","349559","But, A-O,... You just said (a few posts ago) that your view is that personhood. begins at "" mental existence ."" What's it going to be? Birth or Mental existence? Did Baby K have a ""mind,"" A-O? Clearly you can see that Baby had no ""mental existence"" yet she was a ""person"" in the eyes of the law. Ok, (you say) so she was ""born"" that made her a ""citizen"" (a person born)... but by your standards, her lack of ""mental existence"" would have disqualified her as a ""person born"" as (by your logic) there was no ""person"" to be ""born."" You can't have it both ways, AO.","Another opinion","349587","You seem to be under the illusion that I think that what is currently legal is automatically good. Just because the law currently gives rights only from birth doesn't mean that that is where I personally think that rights SHOULD start. I personally think that what is currently legal is better than what you on the pro-life side would have since the laws that you would enact would significantly restrain the freedom of women. However, in the ideal situation where one could pick laws and approaches and make them stick then I would set personhood and rights at the beginning of mental existence, not at birth, since that is where I personally think they should start. The trouble comes in with political reality and how one would phrase a law or change a ruling such as Roe vs Wade to allow for third trimester restrictions imposed based on this new idea of personhood, without opening the floodgates of personhood being pushed by slippery slope to zygotes. I have heard that this is the main obstacle to third trimester abortion restrictions - i.e. that the Democrats are for it but Republicans want to put in language that would allow that slippery slope. If you would let us define personhood permanently legally at beginning of mental existence, then I would be happy to support that and support laws resulting from that, as long as no slippery-slope language was put into the laws or amendments. On a last point, if a baby is born without functioning higher brain functions (so they do not mentally exist), then I personally would disagree with the law and not grant that mind-less baby rights since it would only be a human body at that point, not a human being. This is also relevant at the end of life if people lose all upper brain function in an illness or injury so all that remains of them is the living body with nobody home.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","05:25 PM","abortion-debates","80"

Not that I am entirely opposed to compromises on the abortion issue, A-O. Especially if it will lead to a solution. But,... no deal! Especially when I debate someone with logic as weak as your own,.. I feel that the time will eventually come that Justices Roberts, Scalia, Thomas and Alito will pick up on the findings such as the fact that a person's aging begins at conception and overturn the courts ruling on Roe. In fact, this bill may provide just the sort of push it will take. ND House Passes Abortion Ban Feb 17 2009 7:37PM KXMCTV Minot North Dakota's House of Representatives has passed a bill effectively outlawing abortion. The House voted 51-41 this afternoon to declare that a fertilized egg has all the rights of any person. That means a fetus could not be legally aborted without the procedure being considered murder.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","08:56 PM","abortion-debates","84"

What A-O and you have in common, strange as it sounds, is that you have differing opinions on the metaphysical question which lies at the heart of the issue. I have an opinion that is different from each of yours. As Mr. Justice Blackmun pointed out so cogently in Roe, this is a question that cannot be solved by the picking of one particular person or one particular group's opinion on this metaphysical question and elevating it to the status of law. Therefore, the question of which answer to the prime metaphysical question must needs be left to each and every pregnant woman, as her answer is the only one worthy of credibility. Once again, the topic of whether a particular woman carries her pregnancy to term or ends it is one on which no one but she herself has the answer to.

Up to now, there has not been widespread agreement on the personhood status of a fetus/embryo at various stages of development, which is why Roe vs Wade could take the stance that it did. However, that may not always be the case. In arguing here for my view of personhood (which is very similar to that of many other views here), I am simply playing my small role in trying to make that view a widespread view. This is not an impossible task. There was a time when newborn babies were killed if deemed of little value, where they were not viewed as persons worthy of rights. That changed when culture slowly changed. There are apparently still some cultures in the world that do not acknowledge young children as people. All this says is that the state of personhood beginning at birth is not something that always was and always will be ""written in stone"". It can change when cultures change. In the US, there is and has been widespread agreement from the very beginnings of our country, that born humans are people deserving rights. That stance may yet change in having its limits pushed partly into pregnancy. The failure of the North Dakota and Colorado personhood initiatives shows that most Americans, and this is a relief, would not push the idea of personhood to the beginning of pregnancy. However, I would venture to guess that most WOULD consider a very late term fetus a person. This is something that has simply not been universally addressed in politics since the Pro-Life side would never be willing to settle for that. You should also keep in mind that Roe vs Wade did not give women complete rights to abortion for ALL stages of pregnancy. It does allow the state to interfere in late term for reasons of viability, which are independent of reasons of personhood. Indeed, my understanding is that most states do limit late term abortions to certain exceptions. Though the reasons given (viability) do not coincide with my personal reasons (personhood) for limiting late term abortions, I am currently quite content with the standing of Roe vs Wade since it coincides well with my view of the state interfering in abortion rights only in the last trimester. The only concern I would have about Roe vs Wade is if new technologies would push the state of viability to earlier points in the pregnancy, allowing the state to restrict abortions at earlier terms. Luckily, that won't be a concern for quite some time. On a last note, you should not represent your extreme (abortions always allowed for whatever reason) as the general pro-choice view since most pro-choice supporters WOULD restrict third trimester abortions. Though I appreciate that you are a pro-choice supporter, I think it is important that your arguements take into account the current state of US law and opinion.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","10:44 AM","abortion-debates","89"
