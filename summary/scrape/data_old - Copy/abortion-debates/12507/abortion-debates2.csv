"04-08-2009","12507",2,"Lakrite","348928","Only 0.0012% of pregnancies result in the death of the mother. Simone's link stated that fact. The fact that some women die during birth does not justify abortion, and neither do the 1% of pregnancies resulting from rape. Most pro lifers will agree that if the woman is in danger of dying she then has the right to save her own life over the fetus. One of them will die, and if she would rather live that is completely understandable. She could act ""heroic"" if she wanted to by sacrificing her own life for the fetus, but she does not have to.","simone","349040","Lakrite, you had to do a lot of digital tweaking to pull that off. But, falsifying reality by tweaking a little fact here and there, just another little right wing tweak.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","08:09 PM","abortion-debates","17"

It's not an appeal to authority; it's merely citing to it. There are only three ways to overturn a SCOTUS decision. 1. Persuade the court to overrrule itself, Brown overrruled Plessey; Barnette overruled Gobitis. Not going to happen with this President in office to name replacement. 2. Amend the Constitution. Amendments 12 and 21 are the primary but not exclusive examples. Tried and failed. This wad has been shot 3. Fight a Civil War. Dred Scott. Not going to happen.

Also, though Democratics will probably be favored as presidents as long as the economy or otherwise domestic issues dominate, this may not be the case once the economy improves - at which point the same old ridiculous political games will be played. Therefore, I find it critically important not to sit back complacently and take abortion rights for granted. Since they may someday be at risk, I find it important to remain in forums such as this to try to influence as best one can those that are undecided about abortion rights by honest, civil discussion. In this way, we can do our part in improving public opinion further toward the pro-choice side since our pro-choice majority is not large enough to be politics-proof. I am glad that you are pro-choice but I wish that you would make more effort at understanding that, in order to win over the undecided, you cannot just state your views. You have to actually address the concerns of the undecided - which generally seem to sway between concerns for women and concerns for the fetus. If you completely ignore their concerns for the fetus, then you will never influence their views. After all, if you only ""preach to the choire"" then nothing is gained in the overall cause of abortion rights. The silent undecided readers are the ones that I personally think are most critical to address.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","10:32 AM","abortion-debates","30"
