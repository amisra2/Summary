"04-13-2009","12507",5,"Another opinion","349427","All this goes to show that there is no one universally accepted or scientifically proven definition of person / human being / individual. That is why Roe vs Wade did not base their ruling on the idea of ""person"". The only reason I argue it here is to try to convince others of my and the majority pro-choice view of ""person"", just as you try to convince others of your view of a zygote as a person. However, you try to take a tactic of claiming that your view is purely based on science - a false claim since you also rely on a philosophical assumption along the way.","Chuz Life","349437","Oh please, do tell me,... what part of my logic or findings is NOT scientific based. As you just said earlier that BOTH our approaches were (are) scientific based. ""My view of personhood starting at mental existence is also based on science since science can tell us when that mental existence might start.""--AO","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","06:58 PM","abortion-debates","61"
"04-13-2009","12507",5,"Another opinion","349415","What, specifically, do you claim my fallacy is - that I presumed that they put ""human fetus"" as one definition since pro-life people use it that way? You may note that I used the word ""presumably"" which means that I was making a reasonable guess as to the reason that the dictionary defined child in that fashion. I did not claim it based on absolute logic. According to the dictionary, the term ""child"" is most often used for human beings after birth since, in dictionaries, the first definitions listed generally show the most common useage of a word, with definitions farther down the list showing less common useage. If the same word is used two different ways in the same context, that would mean that the first definition is the more common use of that word in the given context. Unless you claim that the first definition and the fourth refer to different contexts, then I don't see where you are claiming my falacy lies. Also, you should note that I never said that calling a fetus a child was an improper use according to the dictionary. I simply said that it was the less common use. Since Chuz Life seemed to imply that calling a fetus a child was THE official use, not the lesser of two, that is why I called him on it.","Steeeeve","349438","It's not even a reasonable assumption unless you have something indicating this. This is NOT what you said. You said: ""but the very dictionary that you quoted supports the pro-choice view that most people don't use the term ""child"" in that manner. "" This is a fallacy. Lets say 5 people exist and a word has two definitions. Each 4 of those people use this word in definition one more often than not. ALL four each use this word in definition number 2 but only in rare circumstances. So all four feel that both definitions are legitimate but it would show up in a dictionary as most used and least used even if all agree that it could mean both. Your sentence, in its context, implies people feel the last definition is not legitimate and therefore don't use it ""in that manner"". This may or may not be true but you certainly can't say it is true. It is either a fallacy or you poorly presented your position. You did not say this. See your quote above. If you were trying to say this you phrased this in a very condescending way. No, Chuz Life simply said that abortion results in the death of one child. The context of this clearly implies definition 4 from your link (or whoevers link it is). This is not a misuse of the term and I doubt people are getting confused thinking abortion results in a ""person between birth and full growth"" being killed...unless they don't know what abortion is.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","06:58 PM","abortion-debates","62"
"04-13-2009","12507",5,"Chuz Life","349436","Yes, it's clear that you and others require a child to live long enough as to overcome your ability to deny them their ""personhood"" for whatever arbitrarily chosen threshold you've set,... you refuse to hold true to the meaning of the word ""begin."" As you said,... it doesn't ""begin"" until you say so regardless the evidence that it was alive, growing and further developing even before that arbitrarily drawn line in the sand.","Another opinion","349442","For you, an unfertilized egg magically becomes a person/human being/individual on being fertilized. You think a single cell is a person. I don't since I view that as absurd. The only compelling arguement that pro-life proponents ever come up with is that that single cell will BECOME something we value - one of us. The pro-life side then says that because it will BECOME a person, that means that it is ALREADY a person - a logical fallacy. If the zygote would stop its growth and forever stay a zygote, then why would rights even be relevant to it? After all, at that point in time, it is just a single human cell with ""nobody home"" - no mind, no experiences, no sense of pain, emotions, sense of self, no will, nothing. It is just one cell - a thing - an object. All of its worth lies in what it, under normal circumstances, WILL be. Not in what it IS.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","07:02 PM","abortion-debates","63"

And from now on I will report every mischaracterization of my views this way as abuse. There is no ""magically becomes"" anything. Does a child ""magically become"" a person in YOUR view,.. when the fetus finally achieves an undeniable amount of conciousness or brain activity? Magically? You and your mischaracterizations. The definitions say what they say and the definitions legitimately apply. (no twisting or distorting or omissions needed). I didn't write the definitions. The definitions for person say what they say. As does the definitions for human and being etc. SEE HERE ; The only ""thinking"" that anyone has to do is to think about whether they are honest and secure enough in their views as to respect the meaning of what those definitions are as they apply to the origins of a new person's life. And what their rights are to that life. Your subjective opinions and characterizations are of no interest to me. Sigh. And you have the nerve to accuse others of twisting and distorting things. Why don't you do some reading before you ask such things. What it is,... evn in that seemingly deniable form is another human being. Just as you yourself were once in that stage of your own life/ being. And that part can not be credibly denied. And that part is all it takes (in my opinion) to conclude that a person's life begins at their conception. That their rights to their life likewise begins when their life does,... when their aging does,... etc. Now may I go home?","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","07:18 PM","abortion-debates","65"

The laws that exist do not depend on your opinion but on their purposes at the time that they were written.","Chuz Life","349446","Sure we do. Well, at least in the USA we do. Have you no 1st Amendment where you live? What did you think ""petition the government for redress"" means and how else do you think such petitions come about?

The argument of becoming something should be used in the context of relating to other stages of life we all agree are worthy of giving rights to. A newborn is growing into something that will be useful a zygote is too. An unfertilized egg will not. A 10yr old will grow into the something as well...and so on. I think this is the argument advanced and not that something growing is therefore a person.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","07:23 PM","abortion-debates","67"

"04-13-2009","12507",5,"chester","349254","Chuz, This: The perceived ""success"" and ""failure"" of things such as the effectivness of laws is entirely subjective. It depends on your point of view. It might help to know that the purpose of laws is supposed to be (as the founders intended) to secure and protect our rights and to make any violations of those rights ""punishable."" The founders (I'm sure) never intended for the government to control individual's choices and behaviors with the use of power and intimidation enacted into law. is your post #14 on a thread called ""Prohibition"". Want to tell us how you reconcile this with your belief that the government can use its ""power and intimidation"" to keep women from terminating their pregnancies? Just thought I would ask.","chester","349451","My, but you're a slippery eel. Why, one wonders, has your silence on this particular question been so deafening?

You are claiming that 1st Amendment rights mean that laws ALREADY on the books are what YOU (or any other American) say they are? Not in the USA that I was born and brought up in. You seriously need to take a basic class in government. First Amendment rights simply give people the right to speak out against their government which, in turn, influences theirs' and others' voting habits which, in turn, affects NEW laws that come in or the ability to repeal or change existing laws. In other words, it is the political process that changes or adds laws, not mere opinion.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","10:59 AM","abortion-debates","72"
"04-14-2009","12507",5,"Another opinion","349535","I cannot realistically empathize with something that has no mental existence unless I live in a fairyland of imagining personalities in it. Also, if I had been aborted at an early stage, then I never would have been able to tell the difference since ""I"" didn't exist yet, just the body that would become me. So, reciprocity doesn't come into play since I never would have expected that my mother should have been forced to carry me since I view that her rights should have supperceded any imagined rights of a mere body, even if it is the body that would become me.","Chuz Life","349541","For the reader's considerations; Matter of Baby K. 16 F.3d 590 (4th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 91, 130 L. Ed. 2d 42 (1994). Treatment of an anencephalic infant at parental request must be given by the hospital despite its seeming futility. Baby K was born without a cerebrum and thus permanently lacked consciousness. With only a functioning brainstem, she was expected to live briefly at most. After the second incident of respiratory distress, the hospital sought a court order to allow withholding of ventilator treatment against the mothers wishes. Although the biological father of Baby K agreed with the hospital, because he was not legally married to Baby Ks mother and only distantly involved in Baby Ks care, the mother was presumed to be the appropriate decision maker under common law and under both the U.S. and Virginia constitutions . Based on the principles of family autonomy and a presumption in favor of life, the trial court denied the hospitals request unless presented with clear and convincing evidence under Cruzan that to continue treatment would be child abuse or neglect. The appellate court affirmed the lower courts decision, because the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment even if hospital physicians considered such treatment morally and ethically inappropriate. Translation? Baby K, concious or not, capable or incapable of becoming so,... was a ""person"" in the eyes of the law.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","02:10 PM","abortion-debates","75"
