The vile comments you embrace are not ugly because they are supposedly false, but because they treat human life in a contemptuous and arrogant manner, in the context of destroying that life. You can behave with as little class as you want over the internet, but it shows a lot of cowardice since I bet you wouldn't be so prickly face to face with other people.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","11:37 AM","abortion-debates","93"

"04-17-2009","12507",7,"Lakrite","349934","Not fair for the fetus. Overlooked that party, didn't you? What if my belief was that women are not persons and can be killed if they are a problem? Should I be able to kill my wife if my belief is that it is ok? What's the difference","DrD","349936","Actually I didn't overlook anything. If you believe the fetus is a living, breathing being, AS A FETUS , that is up to you and you should abide by your belief. Well, if you really don't understand the difference and think they are the same, then try killing your wife and see what happens. You'll find she is a living, breathing person. I love the logic Chester wrote. ""Let's assume for a moment that an egg is a chicken. Let's assume for a moment that an acorn is an oak tree."" And most of us eat eggs. . . .YUCK! We just ate a chicken and didn't know it.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","07:14 PM","abortion-debates","99"
"04-18-2009","12507",7,"Lakrite","350067","It is a fact that a fetus is a living human being. A fetus is a human being, you cannot disprove that. Its a scientific fact. That comment just points out you really do not know what a fetus is. A fetus is not an egg. A fetus is the union of egg and sperm. Maybe a biology lesson can help you all make comparisons that are actually logical. A fetus is the union of egg and sperm. A chicken egg (the kind that we eat and scrambled and boil) is not yet fertilized. It is just an egg. A human fetus is not to chicken egg as human adult is to chicken adult. As for the acorn...an acorn is a seed. Seed does not=fetus or even chicken egg. Maybe a biology lesson can help you all make comparisons that are actually logical.","electrolyte","350140","Only if you define ""living human being"" that way. That's the whole issue here. You can't win an argument with the fallacy of equivocation. No, it's not. Your repeating a lie doesn't make it true. Wait for it... wait for it... and: And there it is, folks. Absolute idiocy demonstrated by Lakrite. He denigrates others for not knowing what a fetus is, then he demonstrates for all to see that he doesn't know what a fetus is. But wait! It gets better! Later, Lakrite says: Yes, folks, biologically ignorante Lakrite is demanding that people be biologically literate to make logical arguments. In this respect, I completely agree; but by this requirement, Lakrite can't be relied upon to make logical arguments. And oh the evidence for this! Let's take a look: WRONG. The union of an egg cell and a sperm cell is a zygote. A zygote is not a fetus. In fact, after developing, a zygote is classified as yet another stage before it gets reclassified as a fetus. Wrong, at least sometimes. I've seen eggs [for eating] that had embryonic growth within. The fact that some chicken eggs are fertilized and sold for food is not in dispute. Now we see something interesting: a true statement that is true for the reason opposite the point Lakrite is trying to make. How wrong do you have to be to come full circle? A human fetus is indeed not to a chicken egg (even a fertilized one) as an adult human is to an adult chicken. Instead, it would be more accurate to say that a human embryo is to a fertilized chicken egg as an adult human is to an adult chicken. Next, we see the same phenomenon again: Once again, we have a statement that is technically correct but says the opposite of what Lakrite wants it to say. An acorn is a seed. A seed is not a fetus. A seed is not an unfertilized egg. A seed is a fertilized cell (or cells). It is not analogous to a fetus. It is not analogous to an unfertilized chicken egg. It is analogous to the fertilized chicken egg that Lakrite would eat without qualm. It is analogous to a pre-fetal human. Seriously: How are we supposed to treat you not like a ##### when your statements are so moronic?","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","06:51 PM","abortion-debates","101"

It's really simple, yet basic to the topic. Simply put, who is better able to determine the future of a woman's prgnancy - the woman herself or the nanny state? Unless and until that question is answered, complete with the reasons behind the answer, this discussion, and all other discussions on this forum are meaningless.","so-lets-assume-moment-fetus-person","08:59 PM","abortion-debates","104"
