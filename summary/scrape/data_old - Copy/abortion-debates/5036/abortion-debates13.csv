Reviewing all 4,578 cases from 1973 through 1995 in which a final decision was reached, the study found that 68 percent were reversed by state or federal courts. In those cases that were retried, 82 percent of the defendants received a lesser sentence than death and 7 percent were found not guilty. Florida's overall error rate of 73 percent was slightly higher than the national average. In the 23-year period, the state had 870 death sentences, which resulted in only 36 executions because of appeals, reversals and delays. snip http://www.commondreams.org/headlines/061200-03.htm 68 Percent Error Rate Found in Death Case Study Author calls serious problems 'epidemic' Marcia Coyle The National Law Journal snip When the 68 percent overall error rate is broken down into its state and federal components, the study, which covers the period from 1973 to 1995, reports: Of 599 death sentences finally reviewed in their first federal habeas corpus petitions, federal courts overturned 40 percent, or 237, because of serious error. Of the 4,578 death sentences finally reviewed by state high courts on direct appeal, 41 percent, or 1,885, were thrown out because of serious error. When that rate is combined with sentences overturned at the next stage -- state post-conviction proceedings -- state courts found serious error in 47 percent of death sentences. Of 26 states that had at least one case move through the three stages of state and federal review, 24 had overall error rates of 52 percent or more. Two errors trigger the majority of reversals at the state post-conviction stage: ""egregiously"" incompetent defense lawyers who overlook evidence of actual innocence or evidence supporting a lesser sentence, and prosecutorial or police suppression of such evidence. snip http://www.truthinjustice.org/68percent.htm Eye opening isn't it?

"05-08-2005","5036",13,"Steeeeve","None","It is dangerous and unhealthy for an abortion too. you are talking about .001% and .03% death percents (which is where i got my 99.97% by the way). I mean really..to save a life it is not that dangerous. See above...I disagree Can you prove it is not a life? It has its own seperate human DNA....at some point it can live on its own....it looks like you and me....why is it not a life? It is not part of the women because it will come out and continue to live(as opposed to if your lung comes out it will die). So I think the burden on proof is proving it is not alive...as it would be better to play it safe then to risk killing...right? I would say a .03% of ruining someones like is better then a 99.99% chance of ruining someones life.","WhiteFalcon","118591","You fail to answer to my argument. You fail to see how a pregnancy is dangerous to a 13 year old girl and could very easily ""ruin her life"". Reread the post my friend. I wasnt concerned or talking about the ""death"" part of the girl. You say here that you only ""disagree"" on the death problem of the girl. You in no way answered to how a pregnancy is dangerous to a girl that has just begun maturity. In No way is ""abortion"" just as dangerous as making a 13 year old give birth to a baby. Im not just talking about ""death percentages"" here. In both they are low, so Im not arguing that. Pregnancy is hard enough on adults bodys and mind. This is a 13 year old girl that could cause alot of damage to give birth. If you read what I said, I stated ""my personal beliefs"". I dont believe it a child. It is still inside the mother, I dont consider a ""fetus"" an actuall life. Sure in time it could devlope into one, however when it is a ""fetus"" to me I dont beleive that you are actually killing a ""human"". I fell a ""human life"" is made when a baby is exposed to the world and is outside the women. When it is capable to live without being in the mother. I dont need ""proof"" because there are so many different beleifs and what it comes down to is ""their own personal belief"".","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","02:10 AM","abortion-debates","187"
