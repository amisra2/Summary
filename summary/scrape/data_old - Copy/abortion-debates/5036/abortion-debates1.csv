And I just love this little line right here: ...the teen, who has been in state custody for four years...

"05-03-2005","5036",1,"None","None","None","Diogenes99","115968","There was a study in Britain back in 1999 that concluded the risk of breast cancer following an abortion was trivial, almost as insignificant as getting lung cancer from a lifetime exposure to second-hand smoke - UNLESS it was the first pregnancy that was interrupted. If the first pregnancy was interrupted, the likelihood of subsequent breast cancer was right up there with the likelihood of lung cancer after a lifetime of smoking. (The study is obviously not politically correct, so I've seen no mention of it on this side of the Atlantic.) The study didn't address causes, and only noted the correlation, but the lead doctor did speculate that it may have something to do with hormonal changes that need to run to completion. Once again, the state of Florida takes the lead in losing and abusing its children.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","03:15 PM","abortion-debates","5"

Most 13 year olds bodies can not physically endure a pregnancy without sustaining damage. The lobor is the least of it. They are barely more than little girls. Not to mention I am far more forgiving of a young girls stupidy than somebody older. Almost everything 13 year olds do is dumb. I speak from experience. As far as 13 year old girls having sex - I think they barely know what they are getting into. I suspect most are ""talked into"" at that age. Just curious oh furious Tigeroo - since you are all about how these girls deserve such pain for their stupidy - what shall we do with the fathers? Balls in a vice for the duration of labor? Or maybe we just should not use something as serious as pregnancy as punishment.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","04:54 PM","abortion-debates","8"

Chances are - she does not know, she simply does not get it. Not at that age. No real idea about pregnancy or parenting. She is a child. Not to mention - a body ill-prepared for pregnancy will not just be harmful to mother, but also baby. I note that you did not responde to my part about the fathers. So it's not that you think people who make stupid mistakes deserve pain - but that stupid females do - exclusively.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","05:04 PM","abortion-debates","10"

A 13 year old who has sex in the first place does not have the maturity to even understand how stupid that is! I agree that she is not very smart but don't be so judgmental, you don't know what her life is like or what she has gone through. Also, in the custody of the state, do you really think she has the means to have and raise the child who would no doubtedly end up in the same cycle as the young mother? As a young parent myself, not 13 but still young, I whole heartedly agree that if the girl want's an abortion, she should be able to have one. And she is going to have one because the state is allowing her to have one. For the young girls near future, i hope that the state will put her in some therapy and help her understand that she is too young to have sex.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","05:28 PM","abortion-debates","14"
