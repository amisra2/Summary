Following Karl Rove's orders? Oh, but in this case the parent was the State of Florida, Jeb Bush's Florida, he's the governor, remember that? Sooooooo, where was the parent of this unfortunate child? Why did it take so bloody long for the bloody parent to notify the proper authorities that this CHILD was missing--and remember SHE IS A CHILD?","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:54 AM","abortion-debates","61"
"05-04-2005","5036",5,"Voice Of Reason","None","Nikki, who speaks for the innocent, defenseless baby in the womb? They have committed no crime...........They have a right to life...............40,000,000 abortions since Rowe V Wade was approved in 1972....... So very sad..........","simone","116465","Oh! Here we go again! The HOLY, PRECIOUS, SACRED FETUS IN THE WOMB! Which becomes a piece of fecal material to folks who worship only the fetus as soon as it exits the womb.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:59 AM","abortion-debates","62"
"05-04-2005","5036",5,"simone","None","What an unholy pile of addle-pated twiddle poop! So, in your estimation a 13-year-old has the adult level of reasoning necessary to protect herself from being raped or seduced by another person, most likely an adult who has insinuated himself into her life and convinced her that he is trustworthy. And at the same time you claim that she is not mature enough to take care of the resulting child. Hmmm, wonderful logic here. So, where were the state custodians in this stupid little, tragic comedy? Where was the wonderful presence of Governor Jeb Bush who runs the state of Florida so wonderfully, including a child protection agency that has the most wonderful record in the world? But, you can't answer that, can you?","tiggeroo2005","116466","If you refer to the beginning you'll find that I put if she was NOT raped I think that she should have to go through the pain. At least she'd never do it again!(IF she wasn't raped!) I feel differently however if she were raped!","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","10:00 AM","abortion-debates","63"
"05-04-2005","5036",5,"Steeeeve","None","I think that every mistake has a consequence and by letting her make the decision to have an abortion is like telling her that having sex at 13 is ok because you can just get an abortion. How about showing her that there is a consequence to her action. She won't be having sex again if she has that baby. Not only that, a life will have been saved. I don't think her life would be ruined unless she ruins it. Obstacles don't ruin someones life....Your own personal choices do. You are right, she isn't mature enough to have sex, take care of a baby, or be pregnant (have a baby), however she is mature enough to learn what a consequence is.","simone","116474","Oh, so you're saying that a 13-year-old CHILD has an adult-level reasoning and maturity to know how to deal with sexuality. And, by the way, I don't believe it is appropriate for a 13-year-old CHILD to be engaged in sexual activities. Where was her parent? Where was the State of Florida, her parent in this case, the State of Florida under the governorship of Jeb Bush? Why did her parent, the State of Florida, neglect to notify the proper authorities in a timely manner that this CHILD had gone missing? How about showing the State of Florida and Jeb Bush that there is a consequence for their neglect of this CHILD?","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","10:10 AM","abortion-debates","64"
"05-04-2005","5036",5,"Heads_On_Pikes","None","And the moral decay of American society at the hands of judges continues unabated - pass the puke bucket please. Now every teenage girl (and boy) in the U.S. will read the headlines tomorrow, and realise there is yet one more improper behavioral consequence they will not have to face. How lovely, a state approved abortion for a 13 year old ward of the state who is 14 weeks pregnant.

Tell me, was it a judge who served as parent of this CHILD? Was it a judge who neglected to inform the police in a timely manner that this CHILD had gone missing? Was it a judge who served as a neglectful parent and allowed this child to go missing and fall prey to predatory men? Was it?","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","10:14 AM","abortion-debates","65"

"05-04-2005","5036",5,"FISHX","None","Not to be pedantic but have you any sources to the uk study from 1999 please? Only asking because it doesn't make sense that termination of a first pregnancy can increase the chances of breast cancer yet a miscarriage or still born in a first pregnancy doesn't yet in both cases the hormonal changes have not run to completion.","Diogenes99","116508","I don't, but I wish I did. It raised an interesting question that I think deserves further investigation. The study only noted a correlation, and drew no conclusions of causality. A naturally occurring miscarriage or still birth may somehow provide an orderly shutdown for the interrupted changes, but it's all speculation.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","10:27 AM","abortion-debates","69"
