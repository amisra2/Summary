Financial issues, health issues, access to medical care, having a safe living environment and a million other issues will continue to impact pregnancy and influence the decisions of women regardless of the legal standing of abortion. If you really want to reduce abortion and help babies - you have to do better than this - otherwise you will fail. That or you really don't care. Oh, and not to split hairs - but actually women at this point in time do have the right to terminate their pregnancies (at least in the US).","Voice Of Reason","121786","And we have a lot of women that who have had abortions regretting it the rest of their life including the woman who wast the complaintant in Rowe V Wade....... Plus 40,000,000 babies aborted since 1972, most needlessly........40,000,000 think about it.......that figure is numbing.....That is more people then there are in New York and California combined..........","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","06:54 PM","abortion-debates","256"

And thanks, by the way, for proving my point. You still insist on not acknowledging any woman's issue outside of violence done to her or impending death as anything that deserves to be recognized. You don't care about women. Really, you don't.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","10:27 PM","abortion-debates","259"

First, you would have to prove that overpopulation would exist if all the aborted babies had been allowed to live. If you were to prove this, you would have to explain why we should get rid of babies to solve that problem instead of the elderly, mentally retarded, handicapped, etc.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","12:00 AM","abortion-debates","260"
