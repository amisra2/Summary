She is still a child and her parents should be making these decisions....not the courts or anyone else. Personally, I think that a life begins when ""the breath of life"" is given to a born infant. If life begins at conception, could you take that fetus out of the womb and it live? No, so to me, it is not a living viable entity, it depends on an umbilical cord to exist. That is how I see it.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","10:13 PM","abortion-debates","46"
"05-03-2005","5036",4,"None","None","None","Steeeeve","116333","WhiteFalcon, I think that every mistake has a consequence and by letting her make the decision to have an abortion is like telling her that having sex at 13 is ok because you can just get an abortion. How about showing her that there is a consequence to her action. She won't be having sex again if she has that baby. Not only that, a life will have been saved. I don't think her life would be ruined unless she ruins it. Obstacles don't ruin someones life....Your own personal choices do. You are right, she isn't mature enough to have sex, take care of a baby, or be pregnant (have a baby), however she is mature enough to learn what a consequence is.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","11:19 PM","abortion-debates","47"

Now every teenage girl (and boy) in the U.S. will read the headlines tomorrow, and realise there is yet one more improper behavioral consequence they will not have to face. How lovely, a state approved abortion for a 13 year old ward of the state who is 14 weeks pregnant. http://www.sptimes.com/2005/05/03/St...bortion_.shtml","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","11:35 PM","abortion-debates","48"

She isnt even old enough to understand these ""consequences"". How about instead showing her and making sure she knows the repercutions of such actions. How about teach her so she actuall knows the problems here. A ""consequence"" should end when the person knows that whatever they did was wrong. Here the consequence effects her whole life. A baby at 13 is a hudge burden, and would effect her her whole life. This girl would never beable to learn from this mistake, because the ""consequence"" would ruin her life, and never end. Its not that cut and dry. Sure she made a mistake, however this ""consequence"" is unfair and rediculous. How about teach her the problems of these acts, and when she is mature enough to handle them. If she is taught how to have sex safely and the repercutions and all ""consequences"" of sex, then Im sure it wouldnt be as much of a problem the next time she has sex. And the girls life would be ruined, along with the boys. Im sure the baby wouldnt have that wonderful of a childhood with a 13 year old girl as its mother. You dont think a 13 year olds life would be ruined if she has a kid!? She would definitly ruin her life if she has a kid at this age. And both her having sex and having an aborition or not is a ""personal choice"", which would ruin her life. Yes she is mature enough to LEARN what a consequence is. Making her have a baby wouldnt teach her. You need to educate this girl, not ruin her life with making her suffer a consequence she probably was barley aware of.

Lots of things are obstacles in my life...they don't ruin it. so is KILLIING THE 14 WEEK OLD UNBORN BABY...but no one seems to care about that....actually, I don't think making her have the baby is unfair. What better way to teach then to give her the chance to see what having sex does. I am sure she had learned at some point that having sex can get you pregnant...that obviously didn't work. This will. If I steal something something I should pay a consequence too...jail time...I don't ask for someone to teach me that stealing is wrong.

"05-04-2005","5036",4,"Diogenes99","None","There was a study in Britain back in 1999 that concluded the risk of breast cancer following an abortion was trivial, almost as insignificant as getting lung cancer from a lifetime exposure to second-hand smoke - UNLESS it was the first pregnancy that was interrupted. If the first pregnancy was interrupted, the likelihood of subsequent breast cancer was right up there with the likelihood of lung cancer after a lifetime of smoking. (The study is obviously not politically correct, so I've seen no mention of it on this side of the Atlantic.) The study didn't address causes, and only noted the correlation, but the lead doctor did speculate that it may have something to do with hormonal changes that need to run to completion. Once again, the state of Florida takes the lead in losing and abusing its children.","FISHX","116446","Not to be pedantic but have you any sources to the uk study from 1999 please? Only asking because it doesn't make sense that termination of a first pregnancy can increase the chances of breast cancer yet a miscarriage or still born in a first pregnancy doesn't yet in both cases the hormonal changes have not run to completion.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:27 AM","abortion-debates","59"
"05-04-2005","5036",4,"tiggeroo2005","None","Like I said before if she had the stupidity to get pregnant she should at least have to go through the labor pains! She can give it up for adoption. Well, she should be required to give it to adoption because she is certainly not mature enuf to take care of it!","simone","116457","What an unholy pile of addle-pated twiddle poop! So, in your estimation a 13-year-old has the adult level of reasoning necessary to protect herself from being raped or seduced by another person, most likely an adult who has insinuated himself into her life and convinced her that he is trustworthy. And at the same time you claim that she is not mature enough to take care of the resulting child. Hmmm, wonderful logic here. So, where were the state custodians in this stupid little, tragic comedy? Where was the wonderful presence of Governor Jeb Bush who runs the state of Florida so wonderfully, including a child protection agency that has the most wonderful record in the world? But, you can't answer that, can you?","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:50 AM","abortion-debates","60"
