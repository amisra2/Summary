When the post you cited as proof refutes your claim, and you have full knowledge of what the post said, is that not a lie? if your post siad A and I said it claimed B, and I cited the post, would I be lying?","Steeeeve","124408","Have you lost your mind? I got no idea what you are talking about.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","10:30 PM","abortion-debates","361"

You cited my posts which did not imply anything of the sort you claimed it did and what I thought. In fact, some of the cited refute such claims.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","10:34 PM","abortion-debates","362"
"05-17-2005","5036",25,"Steeeeve","None","Not really, this case was different in that the state was the guardian. Although I am sure it has happened before. As for three reasons... 1) The state of Florida doesn't believe a 13 yr old can have sex (consent) so why couold she be able to cosent to an abortion? 2) The State is the guardian and they should be able to say where she can and can't go as a parent would be able to do....and the state has a law against taking kids to abortion clinics. 3) ABORTION IS KILLING A KID. Maybe that doesn't matter for most :-/","xeiah","124422","Right, the state must protect a minor that by thier age of concent laws has been raped by forcing her to under go a physical truma to her body 7 times more likley to permantly damage her than the alternative proceedure that would completly slove the whole problem and then said state expects this thirteen year old girl to then become wholy responsible for what is now an autonomus life when the state deems she's not even old enough to have leagaly made such life in the first place. I said practical.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","10:41 PM","abortion-debates","364"
"05-17-2005","5036",25,"Nurglitch","None","No, she can't consent to a medical procedure, but either her guardian can, or a judge can decide the issue if the guardian's decision is contested: http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,155326,00.html All perfectly legal apparently. A question though - how much more likely is it for a woman to have a second abortion than for her to have her first one?","Steeeeve","124424","Yeah, I know it is legal but it is a bit sketch and hypocritical if you ask me. To be honest Nurglitch I don't have the numbers on me...It has been posted before. I can get it to you maybe tomorrow after work. I gotta go to bed now though.

I take it as complient that you are unwilling to address the vast problems of your claims and that as a last resort you would rather ignore me then deal with your own inherent all encompassing failures.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","01:09 AM","abortion-debates","366"

It takes considerable more maturity to handle pregnancy than abortion. And no - just being pregnant won't help or make her responsible. There is simply no good ending to a 13 year old being pregnant. We really need to work on not having them get there in the first place.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","03:30 AM","abortion-debates","367"

My agruement (right now) is not that she is mature enough to have the baby but rather she is not mature enough to make a decision about that. As for the responsibility thing. I kinda think that if abortion were to become illegal (for the most part) then you would see less kids having sex and less kids getting pregnant. When a 10yr old girl sees her 16yr old girl get pregnant on accident then maybe she will think twice about having sex at 13. Granted this is not a great reason to end abortion as it doesn't really address the 16 yr old but I think it might be true. I still say you need to help out that 16 yr old girl as much as possible. However, with abortion being legal she will most likely not receive any help as it is hard to get people to stop degrading women when people are degrading babies. Nevertheless, I think the 13yr old girl go the abortion not too sure though.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","07:35 AM","abortion-debates","368"

Decisions like this she would generally be making with the input of her family and doctors. The way it always out to be! It won't increase responsible action until we take a mature stand on sex. We are so stupidly puritanical about it. Information and resources make the biggest diffference in ALL matters.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","02:08 PM","abortion-debates","371"

I remember me at 13 and I was no where close to being able to make a decision about what to eat. A mature stand on sex may be needed. However, I don't beleive abortion allows for that. It is almost like saying ""if the sheeeet hits the fan then you gotta back up plan""....and that really doesn't teach responsibility (which is a big part of maturity). I was talkign to a girl at work about this actually....I think that a good up bringing and ""base"" (if you will) is a strong part about being mature on sex. It all starts at the home","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","09:46 PM","abortion-debates","374"

I also remember pregnancy. They don't go together. I would have no issue with all pregnancies of girls that young being terminated - but I am pro-choice and don't make decisions for other people. It's been said before - abortion is a symptom. Contrary to some women-haters in here, as a rule women aren't having abortions for frivilois reasons. Fix the reasons why and we have healthier, happier moms and babies and abortion goes down. Simply banning abortion WILL NOT and CAN NOT do this. Maybe abortion will go down - but illegal ones will go up - as will poverty levels. Abortion is needed medical procedure. It should be legal and safe. It should be a last resort. However, current conservatism keeps bringing that last resort closer and closer when they cut programs that help, demonize women and refuse to acknowledge and address the reasons women abort.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","02:12 PM","abortion-debates","375"
