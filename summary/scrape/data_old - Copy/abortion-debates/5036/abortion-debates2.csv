A 13 year old who has sex in the first place does not have the maturity to even understand how stupid that is! I agree that she is not very smart but don't be so judgmental, you don't know what her life is like or what she has gone through. Also, in the custody of the state, do you really think she has the means to have and raise the child who would no doubtedly end up in the same cycle as the young mother? As a young parent myself, not 13 but still young, I whole heartedly agree that if the girl want's an abortion, she should be able to have one. And she is going to have one because the state is allowing her to have one. For the young girls near future, i hope that the state will put her in some therapy and help her understand that she is too young to have sex.","Voice Of Reason","116113","You make some great points but she could carry the baby to term and then put it up for adoption...........There are long lists of people wanting to adopt babies...........I know a couple that waited 5 years and then adopted a child from South Korea.......... Why does the innocent baby have to forfeit its life?","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","05:35 PM","abortion-debates","16"

No real idea about pregnancy or parenting. She is a child. Not to mention - a body ill-prepared for pregnancy will not just be harmful to mother, but also baby. I note that you did not responde to my part about the fathers. So it's not that you think people who make stupid mistakes deserve pain - but that stupid females do - exclusively.","tiggeroo2005","116145","Sorry I didn't read all of it! the father also should be punished but usually is because of having to pay child support. However, it should be a privilege for the mto be able to pay for their mistake. Maybe we need to start educating those in middle school at 6th grade the difference between love and having sex.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","06:17 PM","abortion-debates","22"

"05-03-2005","5036",2,"None","None","None","Steeeeve","116195","The 13yr old girl was ruled to be smart enough to know if she wants an abortion or not. However, if she is smart enough to get an abortion then she is smart enough to have sex, know the consequences, and know how to take care of a baby. I honeslty don't think the 13yr old girl knows the consequences of her actions at all and therefore shouldn't have sex, get an abortion, or take care of a baby. Obviously she had sex and got pregnant. Now she needs to learn the consequence of this action much the same way I learn from my mistakes. Should she keep the baby? No, because she doesn't know how to take care of one. If you let her get an abortion you are just saying that there are no consequences to your mistakes because we can always cover them up or make them easier for you. This really gets me steamed. She had sex, she needs to know what happens when you do have sex. I bet she will have many more abortions after this because there is no consequence to being irresponsible anymore.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","07:30 PM","abortion-debates","29"

Honestly and I am sure you are looking for the truth, when I was pregnant, I didn't say anything, to anybody. I didn't even realize i was pregnant until i was 4 and a half months pregnant and once i found out i was too scared to tell anyone and didn't tell my dad till i was 8 months along. And also, if i am here being honest, i never called her my baby in the first place, not until i had her for 3 weeks, because i didn't like her, i didn't understand how to take care of a child and never had a mother myself. If my father had known or i went to planned parenthood or knew more about babies, i would never have had her. Thankful now that i have her, it wasn't always that way and there was resentment for a long time. I was lucky, i had the support of my family but millions of women don't have that help, don't have support and abortion can seem like the best option for them, even if they later regret it, which is stupid on those mothers parts. If there was doubt, the mother shouldn't have done it. Sometimes what seems right at the time, if your broke and have no one, then later in life, you have more support and what not, it's easy to regret it i'm sure.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","07:31 PM","abortion-debates","30"
