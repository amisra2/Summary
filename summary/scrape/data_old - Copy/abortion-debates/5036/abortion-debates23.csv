I didn't know that you had such a great sense of humour. Because of Jito's gutter mouth I have decided to remove two of her red-neck merit badges. If she does not clean up her language, I am going to put the Tic-sex pox on her. That would be bad, very bad.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","11:18 PM","abortion-debates","336"

I have never had an abortion and busted my XXX my whole life for my little boy. His snide little comment about a ""bad hair day"" was WAY out of line. It was out of line the first time he claimed that women use it as an excuse to have abortions and it was certainly out of line with me. He trivializes and dismisses extremely important women's issues. He has trivialized what I went through when pregnant and what I go through now as a mother. On top of that his comments dismiss and insult me and my son. In my book he is the worst kind of pig.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","11:35 PM","abortion-debates","337"

I guess if you support slavery though and prefer devaluing human life...In fact you probably support devaluing women too (which many are against on this forum). You would be ok with girl being on the corner or maybe even having a 5yr old in the sweat shop for 10hrs. So YEAH IT MATTERS. So just because other people do it means it is ok?
