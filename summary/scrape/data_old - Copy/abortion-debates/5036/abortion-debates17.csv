"05-12-2005","5036",17,"FISHX","None","Could you please supply a source to substantiate your claim that childbirth is more of a risk to a 13 year old than termination is? bearing in mind that i have had a child at 14 and there was no mention of childbirth being any more of a risk because of my age which if this was true i am sure my doctor would have informed me and suggested a termination which he didn't.","Voice Of Reason","121478","I don't think he/she can do that unless the source is and abortion clinic which profits financilly from performing abortions........","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","11:52 AM","abortion-debates","242"

I would suspect that the actual risk, as opposed to the average risk, depends on who it is that's having the baby. I don't really know the details of either case, so I can't make a functionally accurate call. Mind you, it could have been the case that you were such that carrying to term was less risky for you. Or maybe your doctor didn't approve of abortion. Without knowing more I couldn't say. But then I'm not arguing that the girl in question should keep the baby or not, I'm saying she should have the choice and that the better choice (if the alleged statistics hold true) appears to be an abortion. Personally I'd prefer that abortions don't happen, but I feel that a woman's choice is preeminent in these matters - a woman should be able to choose, for good or ill. VoR: The men had their say when they decided to engage in risky sexual behaviour with the woman.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","12:04 PM","abortion-debates","243"
"05-12-2005","5036",17,"Voice Of Reason","None","Sudanese babies have already left the womb........This is not about children already born.........This is about murder in the womb Nice smokescreen though","Adept","121496","Smokescreen shmokescreen. It's a cross-application of theories. You claim there is no logical reason to murder babies in the womb. Fair enough. But what follows on from that is that we must not do anything unless there is an obviously logical reason to do it. So basically, as humans, we can provide ourselves with the necessities for life, we can procreate, but everything else is unneccesary and thus discarded. Now, clearly this is not the case. We do, and are allowed to do things all the time which are not strictly logical or necessary. We can get drunk and sing karaoke, we can own pets, we can kill and eat animals, and even each other in some places of the world. And if we want, we can murder unborn babies. Even if you don't think it's logical.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","12:11 PM","abortion-debates","244"

However the issue at hand is whether or not she has a right to change her mind several weeks or months after the original decision. More importantly, the question is: At what point does a potential citizen have a right to the protection of the state? Unfortunately the Supreme Court interrupted the political discussion, and thereby set off a cultural civil war that has gone on for more than thirty years.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","01:06 PM","abortion-debates","245"

Someone saying something is true does not make it so i have noticed that there is a lot on the risk of termination on the net but not so much about risks in childbirth. It is my oppinion that childbirth is no more risky at 13 than it is at 30.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","01:11 PM","abortion-debates","247"
"05-12-2005","5036",17,"None","None","None","Nurglitch","121583","Just to be nit-picky, it might be something to point out that logic is merely the formal rules by which you reason, and things only logically follow from the values that you've inputted. . In logic there's a difference between a valid argument and a sound argument. A valid argument merely satisfies the formal requirement that the conclusion follows mechanically from the premises (x + x = 2x is a valid argument, for example). A sound argument satisfies the formal requirement and the premises are true. So while a conclusion may follow logically from a set of premises, those premises themselves may be false. It's important to differentiate between the logic you're using and the argument you are using that logic to prove. You can only use logic to prove something when the premises you are working from are either proved to be true, or assumed to be true for the sake of argument. Now, to say that something is logical or necessary, you're implicitly saying that something is logical or necessary given a particular set of premises. It may be logical to abort children when it follows from our basic values. If we presume our values are good and true, and aborting children follows as an implication of those values, then either aborting children is good and true, or our basic values are not good and true. Basic values, however, cannot be proved or disproved, only assumed as primitive. It is not a matter of logic what basic values one chooses to hold, but rather a matter of convenience and habit, as Thomas Kuhn suggests in his concept of the 'paradigm shift'.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","01:16 PM","abortion-debates","248"

"05-12-2005","5036",17,"Nurglitch","None","Then take it up with Jitobear. I'll see what I can do to dig up the numbers from the internet where people wrote down very careful hearsay. Indeed it doesn't. But I'm not making a claim to truth, which is rather impossible on the internet, but stating a conditional. IF something is true THEN something else must be true if that something else follows by induction or deduction. I can't say I've really formed an opinion about whether childbirth is riskier for any woman at 13 than any woman at 30. In the case that it is true, I don't think that it really matters on the issue of whether a particular person should be allowed to choose whether or not to undergo an abortion. But in the case that it is, note the conditional, it may be more prudent for her to undergo the procedure. It is certainly better, in a moral sense, if she is allowed to make that decision for herself.","FISHX","121605","I completly agree that it doesn't matter if she is 13 or 30 but then i am not the one stating that it is more risky for a 13 year old to give birth than it is to terminate.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","01:32 PM","abortion-debates","251"

Financial issues, health issues, access to medical care, having a safe living environment and a million other issues will continue to impact pregnancy and influence the decisions of women regardless of the legal standing of abortion. If you really want to reduce abortion and help babies - you have to do better than this - otherwise you will fail. That or you really don't care. Oh, and not to split hairs - but actually women at this point in time do have the right to terminate their pregnancies (at least in the US).","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","02:18 PM","abortion-debates","255"
