You have no compassion for women who are pregnant Everything they go through during a pregnancy is the equivalent of a ""bad hair day"" unless it kills them.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","01:52 PM","abortion-debates","271"

You have tried to say you ""understand"" if the woman was raped, but you've been unable to logically explain that one.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","02:13 PM","abortion-debates","273"

You believe health concerns are irrelevant unless the woman is going to die, and this view is abhorrent to me and disgusts me on many levels. While we're at it, if I'm a baby-killer you are as well since you support abortions in the case of rape.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","02:33 PM","abortion-debates","275"

I wonder how many women have died giving birth since 1972 here in the U.S.........Maybe a couple of hundred........... Lets see a couple of hundred to 40,000,000.........you do the math my friend........","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","03:06 PM","abortion-debates","276"

I do care for the fetus, but I believe women are more important. You believe the opposite. Which is more morally corrupt, Voice of Reason.

Pregnancy puts various amount stress on a woman's body, and that stress is dealt with in different ways. For some, that stress is easy to manage, for others it is a serious health concern. To dismiss all health concerns as you are doing physically makes me sick. A woman's health is more than ""convenience"" for the woman involved.","13yr-old-girl-wants-abortion","03:24 PM","abortion-debates","279"

I don't believe ""having a summer without tennis"" is a valid reason. However, no pregnancies are the equivalent of that.
