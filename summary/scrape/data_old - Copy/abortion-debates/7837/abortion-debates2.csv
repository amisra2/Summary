"03-30-2006","7837",2,"Another opinion","None","To those who are pro-life, I pose this set of questions: If a embryo were conceived that had no mind or soul and would never develop a mind or soul (so it would ONLY be a living human body with ""nobody home""), would you still have objections with a woman aborting that embryo? If yes, why? If no, then what are the main differences you would see between that situation and a typical pregnancy? If you think that there is a mind or soul in the earliest embryo (right after conception), then why do you believe this? Otherwise, do you think that one should not abort an early embryo because it will someday have a mind or sould?","Prototype","204686","Well, if you're talking about this as a reason to make ALL abortions illegal, I would probably say get rid of abortion anyway. There are very few abortions made for that circumstance. And besides, you can never know whether a baby would never have a mind. Every baby (this is my belief, you can disagree if you want) has a soul. It's not something you develop. And coming up with a reason to kill it simply because its undeveloped is merciless. Lets kill all the sick, undeveloped babies who may have health problems instead of helping them out! Now there's an idea.","early-fetus-not-human","01:57 PM","abortion-debates","16"

Souls can't be brought into this debate, something religious or metaphysical should not be allowed to be involved in legislation.","early-fetus-not-human","02:13 PM","abortion-debates","17"

I am simply trying to get to the core reasons about WHY pro-life people think abortion should be illegal. My personal view is that abortions should be illegal (with the usual exeptions of risk to mother's life, etc.) from roughly the third trimester on (and allowed before that) since Science seems to tell us that this is the earliest point when the higher brain functions of thought and emotion can start to emerge. I find it hard to have much sympathy for a very early fetus since there is ""nobody home"" that I can have sympathy for - it is still just a body then that will someday have a mind. I was simply asking these questions to see what the views of pro-life people are on this matter. So, what is YOUR view on this? Namely, when do you think an embryo / fetus / baby first starts to have a mind or soul, and why do you believe this?","early-fetus-not-human","02:17 PM","abortion-debates","18"

Rights or not, it is wrong and its an injustice to human life to allow killing. If nobody has rights until they are born, you are assuming that life doesn't begin till birth.

You'll see then why a lot of people don't consider that a good enough reason to ban abortion.","early-fetus-not-human","02:57 PM","abortion-debates","21"
"03-30-2006","7837",2,"Protoboy","None","And my world is hardly limited. I can't avoid this abortion issue anywhere I go. The newspaper, the internet, it's everywhere. I know a lot more than you assume and remember this. I am the fourth in a family of eleven children. I know what things go on during pregnancy and labor and birth. I have had seven brothers and sisters born after me. Would you like to withdraw that little assumption?","thelmoose","204715","Your world is not limited? You fail to mention that you have ever known a woman or couple facing the issue of an unwanted pregnancy. Announcing that you belong to a family that didn't seem to employ birth control is hardly something I would use as a stance from which to have an unbiased or worldly opinion. Also, you're 16 for god's sake, of course your world is limited. No shame in that, just recognize it and have a little humility.","early-fetus-not-human","04:01 PM","abortion-debates","22"
"03-30-2006","7837",2,"Prototype","None","I happen to know that pro-choicers seem to think that 16 year old girls who get pregnant early on can have a say and even make a decision regarding this issue. Simply because I cannot get pregnant and that I'm male makes no difference. ... And my world is hardly limited. I can't avoid this abortion issue anywhere I go.

In another thread you said that the ""irresponsible girl or woman is obligated to take care of it"" yet you make no mention of the obligation of the father. Of course males are entitled to their opinion, but why, if, according to you, they aren't under any obligation to take care of their progeny- do they get to legislate women's reproductive rights? I don't really think you mean this-I just want you to think out the father's role in this whole scenario before claiming that the ""irresponsible girl or woman"" is obligated to do anything. 16 year old girls ""get a say"" and make decisions about this issue because it directly involves their bodies. I don't understand what you mean. Of course you get your say. If you are part of an unplanned pregnancy, wouldn't you want a say? Would you want me here, a woman you've never met, to decide your fate?","early-fetus-not-human","04:32 PM","abortion-debates","23"

There are legal definitions about when people attain certain rights - to vote, drink, etc. Those legal definitions are based on underlying reasons (ex. Your average 16 year old is not responsible enough to vote or be allowed to drink). What would be the underlying reasons for any definition of person? For me, at least two criteria would have to be met: 1) He/she is human - i.e. is alive and has human DNA The reason is that we should cherish our own species more than others (though I would still argue for humane treatment of animals). 2) He/she has a mental existence - i.e. a mind or soul. The reason is that, without a mental existence (mind / soul), a human being is only a body - a biological machine. Machines don't have rights. Does anyone dispute any of those criteria as being part of a definition of personhood? If so, why?","early-fetus-not-human","05:33 PM","abortion-debates","24"

Oh no, wait - you mean DNA closely matching the DNA of organisms that closely match with DNA of organisms we consider humans. Oh no wait...do you really mean organisms that have been shown to be able to breed with you? No problem with the second, which if you don't mind verging off into scifi will also cover AI and Aliens, however the first is just circular reasoning or using such a precise definition that you really don't want it in a legal argument. The second is enough to cover what any one would consider a person, and will hold equally well if we encounter anything really wierd in the future (though a Hive mind might give us an issue). However the first has really just been siezed upon as proof that abortion is wrong by people who really don't know what they are talking about.","early-fetus-not-human","07:27 PM","abortion-debates","25"

I am no more a person than a severly mentally retarded person is. Your claim would be that a person with asheimers disease is not a person. If they are not a person then why treat them as such? It is an inconsistent standard or an arbitary standard that you place. Third trimester is not scientific at all but rather a court made thing to say ""3 periods"". As for why I think a person deserves rights at conception (or soon after) is because it is the only nondiscriminative way to look at it. It provides equality as well and because this is an unsure question it is always best to take the safest stance.","early-fetus-not-human","09:18 PM","abortion-debates","27"

Trimesters are a longstanding medical designation that are related to fetal viability. They are roughly each 12 weeks. Fetal viability prior to the end of the 2nd trimester (24 weeks) is highly unlikely. That is the basis for which 1st and 2nd trimester pregnancy terminations are considered medically appropriate and therefore legal. I think that this may have some bearing on this issue of ""humanhood"". One needs to consider whether the fetus would be able to survive outside the mother's womb.","early-fetus-not-human","09:40 PM","abortion-debates","28"

For the amount of people I've debated, not many of them have been confronted with a woman or couple who've faced this issue either. Yet, they still debate left and right, and being an adult doesn't mean you know more, and being a teenager doesn't mean you know less. Nobody says they can't have a say simply because they weren't INVOLVED in such a situation. I've talked (and debated) with a woman who had an abortion before. There, does that satisfy you? Or are you just going to say that since I only talked with one person that it doesn't matter? Limited world means nothing. I think a lot of people would agree that the radio, the newspaper and the internet are the most informative things in this world. I am surrounded (literally) by these things everyday and I look into abortions of all issues and circumstances. Whether I am young means nothing.
