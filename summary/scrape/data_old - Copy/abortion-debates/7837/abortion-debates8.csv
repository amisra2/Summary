The fact its a different thing means its a different thing, the DNA doesn't really add anything to the debate other confusion.

When I ""get my tooth out"", I do not die, when you ""get your son or daughter out"", they die. A person and a tooth are not comparable. What! DNA has nothing to do with abortion yet cancer does? DNA has every thing to do with the debate, it is one of the rudiments for distinguishing people from each other, and this is exactly what you are trying to do with regard to the foetus and the mother. What is confusing is when you talk about cancer; cancer will not grow into a human being, whereas a foetus is a human being.","early-fetus-not-human","07:02 AM","abortion-debates","106"

I suspect it is that potential that is by far the overriding factor in your view of abortion as murder. As a test, I would ask you the following question: If the newly fertilized egg, or even one month fetus, would stop their developement at that point and stay that way forever with no chance for continued development, would you still call it murder to destroy that entity? If so, why? What would you cherish in that perpetually existing newly fertilized egg?","early-fetus-not-human","09:47 AM","abortion-debates","107"

However, it would be murder to kill that person who is less developed then we are. We are all developed to different degrees, and the level of development is not a factor that determines us as people.","early-fetus-not-human","01:20 PM","abortion-debates","108"

It is simply a hypothetical question to see whether it is something about the fertilized egg as it is *at that moment* that is important to you or whether it is its potential to become something important (ex. you, me and everyone else). Your answer didn't really address the question though. I asked what it was in that unfertlized egg that you cherish, assuming that that egg will never develop farther. You simply restated your opinion that killing at all levels of development is murder. The one thing that you said that does touch upon truly answering the question is: ""the level of development is not a factor that determines us as people"". So, if I am reading you right, you view a newly fertilized egg as a person and that is why you would consider it murder. The thing that is confusing is that I have absolutely no clue what you mean, then, by ""person"" outside of simply having a complete set of human DNA and not being just one of millions of cells of another person. If that fertilized egg will stay as just that, then what makes that a person? This is a very important question and an aspect that I never understood about the pro-life movement.","early-fetus-not-human","01:53 PM","abortion-debates","109"

People who have abortions don't die - which is what you are saying. DNA doesn't have anything to do with it, but if you bring it in, then you bring in the issue of cancer. Cancer cells have distinct DNA from the parent, and can survive without it (infact most cells lines have outlived their parent), cancer cells have human DNA (but don't meet the real criteria - oh but nor does a fetus!). Seeing as you are happy with a fertisilised egg being a human, or a section of a blastocyst even if they will not develop into anything - why do you exclude cancer cells from your definition of human? What is the difference between the two? Why are we trying to dinstinguish mother and fetus, you don't need DNA for that at all anyway?","early-fetus-not-human","02:04 PM","abortion-debates","110"

His entire life will end. However if you compare removing a tooth to removing your son, it is not an equal comparison, because for it to be a valid comparison, the extraction would have to be like for like, say for example: your finger and his finger, your toe and his toe, your eye his eye. Taking his entire body and destroying it means that an equal comparison would be to take your body and destroy it. Agreed? So, when some women allow their pregnancies to take their natural course and are rewarded with children, do people with cancer receive an offspring after 9 months too? No, so the physical comparison fails.","early-fetus-not-human","03:04 PM","abortion-debates","111"

If we are talking blastocyst and early embryos I could just kill a few undifferentiated cells (or perhaps at least donate some bone marrow) and we would call it even. We are very, very different things. Depends what you want to count as an offspring, the cells are alive and can reproduce and grow independantly.

With the late-term fetus, there is someone there that we can feel sorry for if an abortion happens. There are the beginnings of the mind, emotions, thought, sense of pain, etc. These need not be conscious, just like we do not need to be conscious to still mentally exist, as in sleep or coma, but they have to at least exist. With a newly fertilized egg, there is no ""someone"" who we can mourn. The only thing that we can mourn is what that newly fertilized egg might have become. I can understand if you cherish the newly fertilized egg for what it will become. However, you still haven't explained what it is that you cherish about the newly fertilized egg in what it is *at that moment*. If you say that the newly fertilized egg is a person even if it will never continue to develop and the only meaning you attach to the term ""person"" is 1) full set of human DNA and 2) not an integral part of another's metabolism, then, frankly, your definition of person is so empty that it is almost meaningless. Perhaps you seriously think that there is a ""someone"" in that newly fertilized egg - more than just a cell but a cell with a mental existence. Is that your view?","early-fetus-not-human","02:11 PM","abortion-debates","118"

Just because the rudimentary mind is subconscious doesn't mean that it does not exist. All I require is a rudimentary mental existence. When people feel sympathy for another in not wanting that other to be hurt, a mental existence is automatically assumed. Otherwise, there is no other ""someone"" to speak of. This has a lot of meaning to a lot of people. I have answered your challenge. Now it is only fair that you answer mine. Do you or don't you think that the fertilized egg has a mental existence?
