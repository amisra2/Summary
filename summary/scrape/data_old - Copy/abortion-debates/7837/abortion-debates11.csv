"07-17-2006","7837",11,"Steeeeve","None","That's nice... Are you going to expand on this?","happygrl35","222862","Well since you are going to side step the question of the morality of removing a conjoined twin or parasidic twin for convience,I will just go with your original opinion Quote: Originally Posted by happygrl35 I am sure that the stronger twin can opt for removal. not if the other will die....even so, that is wrong. Quote: Originally Posted by Simone What if the conjoined twins have completely independently functioning organs? There are widely varying sorts of conjoined twins. I was referring to where one was the dominant Quote: Originally Posted by happygrl35 Parasitic twins are removed all the time in utero in the us. I am talking about walking around conjoined twins where one is the dominant....stop stalling Quote: Umm actually they can,it called a parasitic twin.Parasitic twins are removed all the time and left to die. Why would you consider it wrong? Because you are killing a person. So you believe that removing a parasidic twin resulting in it's death is wrong because it's a person,and the removal of a conjoined lesser dominant twin resulting in it's death is alos wrong.So like the picture of linked of a woman with a parasidic twin in the form of an extra leg(not her own leg,but that which was left of the parasidic twin) removal of the leg resulting in the death of the parasidic twins leg is wrong because it kils a person? So personhood to you is nothing more than mere biological life? That means if I cut of my finger I am commiting suicide?","early-fetus-not-human","11:38 AM","abortion-debates","159"
"07-17-2006","7837",11,"Steeeeve","None","It is hard to answer a scenario question with no scenario. Your sentence classified it as so. ""Parasitic twins are removed all the time and left to die."" Perhaps I misunderstood you but it seems as if you were referring to two people here. An extra limb is not another person.","happygrl35","222885","So you would agree that this parasidic head is not a person even though she laughs and smiles? http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6998205/?GT1=6190","early-fetus-not-human","12:18 PM","abortion-debates","161"

Hard to say though...I don't think they provided enough information. So I may agree it was a person and I may not.

My original assertion was conjoined twins you might recall. There are cases where you could have two conjoined twins that if you removed one then he/she would die. They might be fully functional outside of say a major artitary being shared (this is only a hypothetical) and otherwise be two unique people. However, in your world view, you would say that it is one person. I'd like to see you go up to the one that would die and say ""hey! you aren't a person....time to die"". Unlike you, I don't choose to not classify humans as better than another....we tried this before and it resulted in much blood. Perhaps if you thought of all humans as the same then we would actually achieve some measure of equality.","early-fetus-not-human","02:58 PM","abortion-debates","164"
