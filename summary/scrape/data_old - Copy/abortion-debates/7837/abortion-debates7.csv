"04-25-2006","7837",7,"Steeeeve","None","You make the assumption that the mind is what has to guide us. An embronic (sp) scienctist would say something different. I am saying that human and person have never not had the same meaning..or rather person has never had a meaning other than ""a human""...until the abortion debate when we decided we wanted to justice it. A simple dictionary will show this. My goal is to not set a point. I have tried to make this clear. If you set a point than you fall into an arbitary arguement. An unfertilized egg is part of a human...getting rid of it would not end the development of a seperate entity of a species. Like I said, if life is continious there is no ""point""..it just keeps on going.","Another opinion","209559","You are missing the point. I am not saying that the majority of scientists take the same ethical stance of the mind being the determining point. I am saying that those most familiar with a non-religious view of the mind (i.e. neurologists) say that it can start to exist around the beginning of the third trimester. THe ethical stance of the mind being a critical factor is my own and that ethical stance is what I am presenting in these posts for general consideration. You have another ethical stance that you are presenting. The readers will decide for themselves and, most likely, not choose either of our stances but come to their own conclusions. Prior to the abortion debate, human and person were almost exclusively discussed with respect to born people, where there is no question that human and person are the same thing. The discussion about pre-born people is new. We are venturing into new territory with such debates and that is why those definitions loose their solid meaning. You seem to be in denial. You keep denying that you set a point while, at the same time, you continue to set one. You do not defend an unfertilized egg, you do defend a fertilized one - THAT IS SETTING A POINT! WHen you call a fertilized egg a separate entity vs an unfertilized egg not a separate entity - THAT IS SETTING A POINT!","early-fetus-not-human","10:17 AM","abortion-debates","91"
"04-26-2006","7837",7,"Michele","None","They are human fetuses. But not a person as yet. There are human sperm and eggs, dog sperm and eggs, etc. When you say that they are human you are merely indicating the origin of the eggs and sperm. Human versus feline or canine or whatever.","Kcajymmij","209853","If it was not a human what species is it? A sperm is just a replication of my DNA; and the human egg is just a replication of the womans DNA; however when these unite an individual human exists with all the chromosomes to be identified as a human, and more importantly an individual because its DNA is unique. Its death is murder, even according to existing law.","early-fetus-not-human","06:35 PM","abortion-debates","92"
"04-26-2006","7837",7,"None","None","None","Tastyfish","209857","Species is an abstract concept - if we are being really technical its not human unless it either a: looks like a human, or b: can breed with one. I'd advise you have a read of the Science and Where life begins thread before you make statements like a person being created at the fusion of egg and sperm. Its not as simple as you might think.","early-fetus-not-human","06:42 PM","abortion-debates","93"

"04-26-2006","7837",7,"Kcajymmij","None","What species is it then?","Tastyfish","209863","None, its unclassified until it meets one of those definitions. Species isn't as cut and dried as people like to think, have a look at the whole herring gull/black backed gull issues, as well as the various dog breeds with red coyotes and wolves. Its really just an arbeitary label we apply to things to make it easier to repeat experiments really - just like colours have no official boundaries and sort of merge into each other at the edges, so do species.","early-fetus-not-human","06:56 PM","abortion-debates","95"

Even being able to predict what organisms might be able to breed with one another doesn't stop species being arbeitary with all the things capable of assexual reproduction or being extinct. Or the wierd thing of one organism being able to breed with two different 'species' who can not breed with each other. We are far closer to chimps in our DNA than we are in our proteins that the DNA codes for - a lot of the genes are near identical with regard to the actual code, we just stick them together differently (after splicing the 'junk DNA' introns out).","early-fetus-not-human","07:12 PM","abortion-debates","97"

Then why do they use it to identify rare birds eggs in prosecution cases? They could use the same principle to convict those killing unborn humans.","early-fetus-not-human","07:15 PM","abortion-debates","98"

I was under the impression that a trained ornithologist would be able to tell the difference between eggs without needing to do a DNA analysis. Its technically shaky ground though, its using the 'I'd know one when I saw it' definition of a species rather than the actual technical one. Law and science do have a tendancy of just assuming they know what the other one is talking about, and law has a ton of other wierdness thrown in from precedent etc. Law likes to be consistent, science likes to be right even if that makes it inconsistant over the long term - its very different viewpoints. Technically speaking, if we do this then transplant organs and cancer cells will count as people under the law Not to mention if you are going to decide that just being 'human' is required for protection under the law and nothing else then you need to say why - and in most cases the explaination themselves, generally tending to be a list of traints found nearly exclusively in humans and regarded as special, would surely do as the set of things required for protection under law. Otherwise You are dragging a scientific term that has nothing to do with what you are making it mean into the legal system, which will just make things more confusing.","early-fetus-not-human","07:35 PM","abortion-debates","99"

An organ just like any other part of a persons body carries a signature in the DNA, that is present throughout the whole body, yet a foetus has their own DNA, and killing it is the destruction of a unique person, with their own DNA. When you destroy a foetus, you destroy a unique individual; you should stop comparing them to the organs of people, that is misleading to people seeking the truth.","early-fetus-not-human","07:45 PM","abortion-debates","100"

Identical twins are seperate people, yet form after a single sperm and egg have fused and have indentical DNA - are they the same person? We're talking comparing DNA to a standard in the bird egg cases anyway and seeing what degree it differs from it, not seeing if each is a unique individual.

The reason it seems so weird having to include organs and cancer as people because they have human DNA is because making having human DNA the sole requirement to count as a person is a utterly stupid idea.
