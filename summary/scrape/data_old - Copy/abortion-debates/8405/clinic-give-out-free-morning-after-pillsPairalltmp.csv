"","07-18-2006","8405","Prototype","None","This sounds like trying to sever the connection between sex and pregnancy. I say that having sex without dealing with a possible pregnancy is wrong. Besides, there are other forms of sex besides... well, the kind that is the direct route to forming a pregnancy. I believe a zygote is the very very first stage of life for any human being. The only form before that is cells and eggs and other material that is lost all the time. A zygote, on the other hand, is a living growing human being and can die. Now you can say all you want on what you believe is a being, but as for me, that constitutes a being.","happygrl35","223151","Sex has many other benefits than just producing a child.And if by accident a child is produced and one doesn't WANT a child the most responsible thing to do is to abort it. I believe human personhood or a human that is capable of activiley participating in the act of BEING begins at best with consistent brain wave patterns that indicate activity in the Cerebral cortex in which is considered *higher brain death* when this area ceases permanent function.This happens about 22-24 weeks of gestation around the same time of viabily.","clinic-give-out-free-morning-after-pills","abortion-debates","34","12:25 PM"

But, pregnancy by accident? You are trying to sever the connection between sex and pregnancies. Sex was created first and formost for sustaining human life, having a pregnancy because of sex is no accident. That's what happens, that is how it works.","clinic-give-out-free-morning-after-pills","abortion-debates","35","04:56 PM"

Now I find that you feel a woman is more important than a fetus and you say it's good! There goes you're credibility. You made a bad mistake here. I'm a pro-lifer, I don't set up the two lives in terms of importance or worth. So value doesn't mean anything. You do. You weigh the worth of life on a scale. I doubt many serious pro-lifers who view this thread are going to bother with you now.","clinic-give-out-free-morning-after-pills","abortion-debates","47","05:07 PM"

Like you had any with me to begin with,you and your male dominate attitude? There isn't anything instrinctivly valuable about mere biological life,therefore the value of a fetus is subjective and relative to the person carrying it. Good,they can keep their policy off of my reproductive organs while they are it.","clinic-give-out-free-morning-after-pills","abortion-debates","50","08:09 AM"
