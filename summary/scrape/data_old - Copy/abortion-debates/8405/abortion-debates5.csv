I challenge you to support this statement.","clinic-give-out-free-morning-after-pills","07:50 PM","abortion-debates","61"
"07-21-2006","8405",5,"Bell","None","*gasp* I did not say this, nor imply it in any fashion. I challenge you to support this statement. It's easy to tell adult women who are in committed relationships that they shouldn't be having sex unless they want a kid, but in practice it's ridiculous.","Prototype","223952","Yes you did. I accept. ---- When you say this, you imply that it is ridiculous to tell women to abstain from sex since their partner may want some. I was showing off the dumb thinking a girl might have if she actually believed that.","clinic-give-out-free-morning-after-pills","07:59 PM","abortion-debates","62"
"07-21-2006","8405",5,"Prototype","None","If you think otherwise, then good for you. I was speaking to Bell there, so if you don't think that way, then you don't need to complain. You're all under this idea that sex was created for pleasure...","Bell","223953","You said: You said all , not Bell . You were not speaking to only myself there. And, by the way, do you think I really think this way? This is quite insulting. I have been very respectful of you, and you have not returned it in kind.","clinic-give-out-free-morning-after-pills","08:03 PM","abortion-debates","63"

If a person speaks in general in a group of people and a single person complains because they don't think in a certain way, then I was not directing the remark to them. Obviously a pro-lifer wouldn't say that, and if she didn't think the way I suggested, then it was a simple case of misunderstanding. Yes I do. I'm surprised actually, because the way you talked, you acted as if the pleasure part of sex was the main thing it was made for. If you didn't think that was bad, I'm surprised your insulted. I don't think so. You have a lot to learn young man! It is ridiculous to try and do certain things! You've treated me as a rather dumb person recently. I'll return it in kind when you show the respect.","clinic-give-out-free-morning-after-pills","08:13 PM","abortion-debates","64"

People have sex for reasons other than procreation. You seem to suggest that procreation is the primary drive or that it is a simple matter to just say no. Because you didn't even understand my post suggests this is true. Your words regarding sexual behavior indicate that you don't understand it from a clinical, sociological nor personal point of view.","clinic-give-out-free-morning-after-pills","08:48 PM","abortion-debates","68"

And I'm not being nasty, I am being utterly serious. I am quite sure that most boys of your age have not gone as far in their thinking. Although I completely and utterly disagree with most of what you say, I do respect the fact that you have made this decision. I hope you will be able to stick to it.","clinic-give-out-free-morning-after-pills","08:59 PM","abortion-debates","70"
"07-21-2006","8405",5,"Bell","None","No, you implied it. I did not. I said, I said this in response to your concept that if women don't want kids, they shouldn't be having sex. I said naught about their partner ""wanting some"". You have either misread my comment, or read what you wanted to into it. You really think I believe sex is for pleasure only? I've said many times that sex is NOT JUST for procreation. Either you are being dishonest or have not retained this information. I said, ""You have alot to learn about sex, young man!"" and this was in response to your comment that women ""release"" their bodies over to their boyfriends for their boyfriends sexual satisfaction. Indeed, if this is your sentiment, then you do have a lot to learn about sex. Wouldn't you agree?","Prototype","223966","No, I believe I received the correct message when I read your post. I've made reading mistakes before, but I don't think I did this time. You're doing it again. I am referring to YOUR PARTICULAR SCENARIO that you said I either misread or read it in a way I wanted. I know girls don't normally just hand themselves over to their boyfriends whenever. And now I'm signing off for the night.","clinic-give-out-free-morning-after-pills","09:02 PM","abortion-debates","71"

"07-22-2006","8405",5,"Prototype","None","And you weren't talking about money or food, you were speaking in regard to sexual satisfaction. Correct me if I missed your point, but you could have made that 10X clearer in your previous post. At least the baby will have a chance. If you think otherwise, then good for you. I was speaking to Bell there, so if you don't think that way, then you don't need to complain.","jitobear","224064","Consider yourself corrected. I popped in with a single statement a few posts back that in the mother/fetus relationship the mother is more important - AND SHE IS. I was not talking about sex at all until my last post. No it won't. The mother needs to be well for the pregnancy to succeed. I am not complaining - just refuting your assumption.","clinic-give-out-free-morning-after-pills","08:13 PM","abortion-debates","73"
