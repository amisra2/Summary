Now I find that you feel a woman is more important than a fetus and you say it's good! There goes you're credibility. You made a bad mistake here. I'm a pro-lifer, I don't set up the two lives in terms of importance or worth. So value doesn't mean anything. You do. You weigh the worth of life on a scale.

Like you had any with me to begin with,you and your male dominate attitude? There isn't anything instrinctivly valuable about mere biological life,therefore the value of a fetus is subjective and relative to the person carrying it.

You're all under this idea that sex was created for pleasure, and it should be as available to everyone like Movies and Games. Well you are all badly mistaken. It's people like you that has treated sex as a thing for fun, and should be treated casually to the extent that young children are infected every hour daily by STD's and HIV.

Many ""needs"" theories include the need for sexual intimacy. Along the same lines of reasoning, you are under the idea that sex is solely about procreation. Well, you are badly mistaken. That doesn't work so well. It would help your cause if you tried to understand that sex isn't just about making babies. It's easy to tell adult women who are in committed relationships that they shouldn't be having sex unless they want a kid, but in practice it's ridiculous.","clinic-give-out-free-morning-after-pills","04:44 PM","abortion-debates","55"

But I'll be sure to check it out. I don't usually get this detailed on sex matters, but I will in this case. Sex is not strictly Vaginal Sex. Sex in general means a lot of things, and sexual satisfaction can be gained without Vaginal Intercourse. Vaginal intercourse, on the other hand, is the direct route to pregnancy. Then a couple steps back later in shock and says ""Gee, she got pregnant! How did that happen?"" Well guess what, they forgot a little reality of nature. What's ridiculous ( in this particular scenario ) is saying ""I am in a sexually commited relationship with my boyfriend. Therefore, I am going to release my rights to my body and allow him to use me and risk my getting pregnant and all sorts of other things so he can get his sexual satisfaction.","clinic-give-out-free-morning-after-pills","05:20 PM","abortion-debates","56"

Who is more important in the mother/fetus relationship. I argue its the mother or the fetus will not even survive. You have not provided anything concrete to refute me. When I talk about needs I am talking about food, shelter, money, medical care, etc. If the mother's needs are ignored the fetus will suffer. The mother is the more important. That is biological fact - no matter how many emotional charged rants about responsibility and baby killing you have. This also does lead into why its the woman's choice as she is in the best place to ascertain whether her needs cans be met well enough to sustain a pregnancy. Her. Not you. Whether you think she should have screwed to begin with is completely beside the point. Your demand that she accept the responsibility as you see fit will not guarantee a succesful pregnancy. First of all you are in no place to tell me or anyone else what ideas we are under. You also make the false assumption that just because we support a woman's right to choose that we treat sex casually. Care to back that accusation up? Or stick to what you actually know? Suddenly your point of view is clearer. You seem to think only guys enjoy sex.

Thanks so much for the sex ed. I wasn't aware of other routes of sexual pleasure. So you are prescribing that people engage in other aspects of sex? Suddenly, you aren't so worried about STD's. Whoa! I don't ""release"" my rights to my body to my boyfriend/husband so he can get ""his"". This assertion is ridiculous!

I have never consulted my science book to see if it said ""Man is more important than bugs"" or anything like that. And I do not see the woman as more importan than the fetus or vise versa. I see them both as human beings with the right to live. And you weren't talking about money or food, you were speaking in regard to sexual satisfaction. Correct me if I missed your point, but you could have made that 10X clearer in your previous post. At least the baby will have a chance. If you think otherwise, then good for you. I was speaking to Bell there, so if you don't think that way, then you don't need to complain. If you had considered the bolded text, you would have noticed I didn't mean that.","clinic-give-out-free-morning-after-pills","07:46 PM","abortion-debates","60"
