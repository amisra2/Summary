Take, for example, the post directly above yours. Of course you know that I do not think that Roe v. Wade has any constitutional merit, but that is an entirely different discussion than I am having here. When someone tells me I can't do X, then I want to know why I can't do X. This is the conversation I am trying to have with the chemist. It's a conversation about first principles--a political theory if you will.","abortion-euthanization","05:43 PM","abortion-debates","319"
"08-22-2007","10129",22,"None","None","None","richbrmly","280004","To be a human being, you must be a being first. The law does not protect non-beings. Example: a brain dead person has lost their state of being and have no individual protection under the law. A Doctor can remove life giving support. The person is parasitic in nature and requires the machine. Example: The foreskin on a male penis has no protection under the law. Clearly the foreskin meets the criteria of being alive. It is human and has DNA to back the fact up. In fact the DNA in the foreskin could be used to regenerate a whole human or fertilize an egg. The foreskin is not a being and has no protection. A Fetus is not a being; It has no brain, no consciences, No state of being. Even the bible clearly demonstrates this knowledge by handing out punishments to a person that causes an abortion to be only a fine, even when the mother wanted the fetus to come to term. Socrates and Plato where pro-choice. Hippocrates outlined how to perform an abortion for women. Yes, abortions where performed when Jesus said to give unto Caesar what was Caesars Mary whom Jesus defended from stoning was a prostitute without children. If there is no mind there is no soul to disturb. We have even discovered all tissue has the code to produce a future life like a fetus. Same conclusion. If we by law cover life that is not a being, we open the door to massive issues.","abortion-euthanization","10:14 PM","abortion-debates","320"

Try the 14'th amendment on for size. Got it?","Phyllis","280019","So you do derive your ethics from the Constitution? That is interesting since you previously suggested that rights exist before they are codified. I guess the virgin would be out of luck if she were not a US citizen. That would be a shame indeed. And, incidentally, you would have had a hard time saying that slavery was immoral were you to have lived in the mid 1800s.","abortion-euthanization","10:41 PM","abortion-debates","323"

"08-23-2007","10129",22,"Phyllis","280015","You mean like if we by law protect things like trees and flowers we open the door to massive issues? Welcome to the club of sophists. You and chemist make a fine pair. What you seem to forget is that the United States has historically prohibited abortion, and there were no issues on the scale you speak of. The fault in your argument is that you seem unable to distinguish between an individual human life and ordinary human tissue. That is a distinction most reasonable people are able to make, and that is the reason why none of the issues you and chemist speak of can ever be found in the history of the United States.","richbrmly","280063","No, I mean millions of people will die if we protect human life. Sounds like an Oxymoron but by the pro-life definition this is true. A sophist earned his way into the public view through education and reasoning. A religious man simply sees a burning bush and decides to stone women for having a period in camp. The thinker is a far better option. Chemist is an atheist and I am not. We have differences on many issues. Yes there where, and the issues are still here. The Terri Schiavo case where the brain had all it motor functions in place, yet no conscience mind. The Brain couldnt reason enough to pick up a glass of water yet the motor skills where complete. The use of Organs from living humans for the repair of other people is directly associated to this issue. A doctor removes vital Organs from a living human for use in another human. I am interested in knowing your stand on the practice. We criminalized abortion in the late 1800s. The death rate of women climbed as high as 15,000 in a year. This was in a period where we didnt have that many to start with. Pre Roe V Wade, the death rate from women with pregnancy issues was 8000 a year. The same rate as Mexico had under its anti abortion law. Doctors where forced to turn in women for their deeds and many simply could not follow the law. In Mexico, women would get sentenced to 1 to 5 years in prison and their ages where pretty wide. Currently under the hard right wings attack on abortion, the rate of womens deaths in the United States has more than doubled, so your message is getting out. As far as complicity in these deaths Ill leave that for God to decide. A fetus does not qualify as an individual. It is parasitic human tissue with no individual human qualities for an extended period in its incubation process. Cancer is an abnormal growth that is individual under your conditions. What something will become can not be quantified reasonably. If we could, we would do what Joshua did and kill babies under many conditions. The bible explains that pregnancy is a curse on the woman. Personally I have never seen it as a curse, but the process is traumatic and leaves lasting effects. The complete birth cycle takes lives to this day. A mother is a hero. Even in nature a mother will defend her offspring against massive opponents. Can law force someone to mother at any point? You and I where born and we know our mothers carried us as fetuses and cared for themselves so that we could come to be. If your mother was forced by law to have you, what effect would that have on you? Knowing your mother was forced to take the trauma of your coming into being? Should we hold a gun to your mothers head? You and I can be against abortion, but can we force a woman to carry a fetus morally? Simply tie people down and force them to host something? If a man is in liver failure, and you change his outcome by connecting another human to him, he would become parasitic and live by means of his host. What would the hosts choices be? Bare in mind the parasitic side of the question. This person qualifies as a human being in all detail. The only difference between pro-choice and pro-life is the use of a doctor. Abortion happens and will happen. Abortion is very simple. Abortion is so simple an 8 year old with a stick can do one. The path to the fetus is extremely easy to follow, and the fetus is in a thin membrane. As far as pro-abortion, I have yet to see people running around telling people to abort. There is no way to stop an unwilling host to a fetus. We would have to tie her down and force her to allow the gestation. If we dont, we are asking for the loss of not only a fetus but the loss of the host. Morally, we would be complaisant in the hosts death. Mexico had 1.5 Million abortions during its last year of law preventing abortion. 8000 women died and 40,000 (think it was) where hospitalized. The United States had 1.2 Million abortions, less than Mexico even though it is legal.","abortion-euthanization","08:29 AM","abortion-debates","327"
"08-23-2007","10129",22,"None","None","None","richbrmly","280064","Some people will see a life in trouble and endanger their lives to save the individual. People jump into icy water and pull another person out even though their bodies have to endure great hardship. Some people do not. They might call for help or do anything that does not endanger them. Should we have a law that forces them to undergo some measure of self endangerment? Anti Abortion law does just this. We force a host to undergo endangerment for the sake of what the fetus will become. Where does the states rights to laws regarding the issue of endangerment for the sake of another individual begin and end? The measure of danger could become equal in nature to the host of a fetus. Would that be the measure to judge others?","abortion-euthanization","09:10 AM","abortion-debates","328"

Your are obviously new here so first off welcome. Secondly, don't think you are posting something new...we've all heard the ""facts"" plenty of times and in this case they are plan wrong and many pro-choicers here will admit that. In any event I believe the death rate while allowing abortion is nearly 100% so it really wouldn't matter what the numbers were anyway.","abortion-euthanization","09:28 AM","abortion-debates","329"
