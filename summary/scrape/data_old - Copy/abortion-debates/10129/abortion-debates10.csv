"07-21-2007","10129",10,"Another opinion","274820","But the structure of our legislative process was meant for these laws to be based on reasoned debate by competent legeslators. If we accept the idea of laws being based not on rational discourse but on gut reaction, then what prevents us once again from enslaving minority groups? After all, if the white power movement ever would gain a large majority, then that is not impossible. The situation with an early term fetus is similar. Almost two thirds of Americans do not think that first trimester fetuses should have rights, and would allow abortion in that case. The pro-life supporters have not successfully made a reasoned case as to why first trimester fetuses should have rights. Do you believe that ethical and moral principals have to be based on reasoned arguement or can they be based on unsupported proclamations? There is a difference between being inspired by religion and making a law based on religious beliefs. For example, one cannot take away the rights of homosexuals only on the basis of quotes from the Bible. Would you think it permissible if, in several decades, the majority of the US ended up being from the Islamic religion and tried to impose Islamic law on all of us through majority rule in congress? You presented the arguement that our view was like the view of slaveholders. It is perfectly legitimate for me to then compare your view, in a similar way, to a hypothetical view. The bottom line is that groups can indeed impose their views on us if those views have been fully debated based on rational supportable reasons. My main claim, and I think chemist99a might agree, is that it is views imposed on us without that fully supported rational debate which are views that we resent being imposed on us. Supported reasoned debate is the best method for getting laws which are as fair as possible.","Steeeeve","274831","No it wasn't. There is nothing anywhere that states you have to be competent to be a legislature. Nothing, in our system of government you have to accept the fact that we can vote to enslave the minority. First off, who cares what 2/3rds of Americans think? 2/3rds of Americans can and have been wrong...on a very similar issue no less. Secondly, I see no more reasoned argument than ""the unborn is a person and people have rights and therefore abortion should be illegal"". That argument is as reasoned as any for abortion....beliefs taken with logic to reach a conclusion. My argument is against the idea of ""pushing beliefs on others"" as this argument does not logically derive correctly and is inconsistent. They are all based on unsupported proclamations or you end up with circular logic. You can believe homosexuals are immoral and therefore vote for laws restrict gay rights. Would it be legally permissible? Yes. Sort of them telling us when to pray they can pass laws related to their religion. But that is not what you did. You assumed a different point and compared that one. I'm just going to post something I already posted regarding the idea that you can't impose your beliefs on others...mainly this issue of abortion: From here we have a few choices: 1) You assume the fetus is not a person 2) it is irrelevant whether or not the fetus is a person 3) the current general level of thinking is the fetus is not a person With option 1 you have assumed something you can't prove or show to be true. If I believe the fetus is a person then it is perfectly reasonable for me to fight for that persons rights. This would be the same as a slave owner believing the slave is not a person but an anti-slavery supporter feeling it is and thus fighting for the rights of the slave. There is no rational argument for defining person...it just is what it is. With option 2 you find it irrelevant whether or not it is a person. If this is the case then you can violate your own statement because if it is a person you have pushed beliefs onto that person and in this case endangers their life. The third option is that we go with the so called ""convention"". This is a bad argument because the convention in the 1800s was that blacks were sub-human and as such have no rights and are property. Your logic would have to conclude here that the slave owners and supporters of slavery were correct in arguing that others shouldn't impose their belief system on them. An argument (once again) used during this time period and an argument that has proved over and over again to be wrong. I challenge you to find me a case in past where a convention declaring something nonhuman to be beneficial.","abortion-euthanization","06:51 PM","abortion-debates","136"

Enslavement violates major portions of the bill of rights. So has said every dictator and tyrant who wished to enslave others! Beware the man who insists on having his beliefs validated by forcing them on others. Man are you lost when it comes to our law. Such would be a clear violation of the wall separating church and state and violate the core of the constitution. The supremes would knock it down like a bothersome fly. At this time IT would NOT be legally permissible.","Steeeeve","274889","I never said with just a 50% +1 majority. I just said we could vote on it. Pay attention. Then should I be aware of you as you push your beliefs on me and others? You are claiming it would violate the core of the constitution and yet I am the one lost? Aside from the obvious point that separation of church and state is not in the constitution and Jefferson is not the supreme reference to the constitution, I'd say the ""core"" of the constitution is setting up a system of government that is functional. The fact that the 1st amendment is an amendment shows this wasn't even part of the ""core"" document. Furthermore, a look into the history of the amendment, its applies use up until 1930 or so and its appropriate understand would all indicate you are wrong. Of course I suppose you are one of those people that don't care what something originally meant.","abortion-euthanization","10:09 AM","abortion-debates","140"
"07-22-2007","10129",10,"Another opinion","274901","Age limits were placed on congressmen to help ensure competence but there was certainly no guarantee of competence. People had the right and ability to choose incompetent leaders. Overall, though, the hope and expectation of the founders was that the legislature would act based on reasoned debate. The reality of politics often got in the way. The first ammendment was meant to stop religious laws from being introduced. The founders had experienced the Church of England being forced upon the populace - this was a major inspiration for preventing any religion from imposing itself on the populace. Also, later ammendments prohibiting discrimination in law based on race would prevent enslavement of the minority. So, there are many safeguards in the current state of the Constitution which protect us from religious or racial persecution. However, I would admit that, if a majority were large enough - say 90% or even 75% - then most or even all aspects of our Constitution could be changed. We could even become an extremist Islamic state if the majority became large enough. Do you see nothing wrong with the degradation of our political and civic culture? Do you believe that ""might"" of numbers alone makes ""right""? If you think that reason plays no part, then you would have to admit that a statement ""the unborn is a person and people have rights and therefore abortion should be illegal"" would be equally valid as a statement ""only whites are people and only defined people have rights and therefore slavery should be legal"". Am I interpreting you correctly that proclamations don't have to be challenged? People can try to force whatever proclamation they want into law and, if they have the sufficient majority, they are certainly justified in doing so? If so, then I hope to God that your view does not become prevalent since it could easily lead to a despotic country where most of our freedoms are lost. As a pro-choice supporter, I would grudgingly accept abortion rights being restricted IF and ONLY IF they were restricted based on full rational debate. In contrast, the slaveholders were unwilling to have ANY debate on the subject. No amount of reasoning would have swayed them from their opinions set in stone. Don't you see the difference?","Steeeeve","274918","I'm sure they hoped they would be competent but there was no rule saying you had to be. Your claim is unfounded. The Church of England was an established religion for the country. The 1st amendment prohibited this but certainly didn't prohibit laws being introduced where the morality behind it is purely religious. Right, and that is the risk of a democracy. I got the impression you did. It seems I'm the only fighting the majority anyway. Right and Wrong, to me, is never determined by the majority. Again with the strawmans. I never said reason plays no part...I just said you can't reason the position. I am perfectly capable of claiming what a person is and if someone says ""only whites are people"" then I'd say they are wrong. What I wouldn't use is an argument saying ""don't push your beliefs on me"". Hate to break this to you but all laws are proclamations and yes they can be challenged. It just so happens that one that tries to define person will always have unfounded reasons. There is no law that is not based on a belief at its root. Once again, my arguement is that, if a group wants to impose their views on us, they need to present arguements that then go through a reasoned debate before they are enacted. Actually the slaverholders had plenty of debates on it. And they used the same reasoning the pro-choice folks use now...things like ""don't push your beliefs on me"" or ""you don't have to have a slave"" or ""they aren't people but subhuman and are meant to be enslaved"". All of those arguments were reasoned from an unfounded belief....much like the unfounded beliefs you and other pro-choicers hold. At the very least I think the unquestionable similarity in arguments from the slaveholders and from the pro-choice folks should be looked at very closely.","abortion-euthanization","04:32 PM","abortion-debates","142"
"07-22-2007","10129",10,"Phyllis","274922","This is simply speculation. Do you have any historical evidence to show that the reason for having such age limits was in order to help ensure competence? I'm sorry, but I simply do not think one can make a historical claim without providing at least some semblance of historical evidence. Yet another bit of speculation that, though reasonable, is not shown to actually be correct. Perhaps the hope and expectation of the founders was to set up a system where the federal government was fairly weak allowing the states to do whatever they wished. Perhaps their aim was to allow the people to govern themselves whether they did so reasonably or not.","Another opinion","274940","All I will say here is that these views were not made up by me but were views I heard on documentaries about the founders, mainly in the History Channel. I do not have the time to research it for myself at the moment. Ultimately, this is a side issue to this thread anyway. If you want to start this as a new thread, then I might be able to take some time to find linkable sources.","abortion-euthanization","05:18 PM","abortion-debates","145"
"07-22-2007","10129",10,"Another opinion","274936","This is a large part of the controversy that is continually being battled out in the courts. It is a matter of Constitutional interpretation. Still you seem to find nothing wrong with a super-majority imposing its will on all in pushing laws with no reasons to support those laws. If I am wrong about this, then explain what I am misinterpreting. Nobody is claiming that nobody has a right to push any views on another. Again (and I don't know why you are not picking up on the difference), we claim that one cannot push views on us without reasoned debate. Also, if you are saying that reason does play some role, then what role do you say it plays? I hate to break this to you but, before the laws are written down in the form of a proclamation, reasons for them are presented and debated. This is true for the great majority of laws we have on the books. This has been lamented by older congressmen of both parties who remember a better time when issues such as whether we go into a particular war were hotly debated. That is an unsupported contention. Provide detailed arguements for that contention. If the slaveholders were held to a full debate where all claims had to be justified, they would have lost. Therefore, they did not choose to hold themselves accountable to any debate. It would have been hard to fully justify that any inherent difference between blacks and whites (which, contrary to their views, really only comes down to skin color) justified taking away rights. In comparison, those of us on the pro-choice side have fully supported reasons for saying that zygotes do not have rights. We are quite open to holding a debate on this issue and have confidence that we would be able to support our views. If some astounding new evidence or arguements were presented by your side that win the debate, then we would grudgingly accept the consequences (at least I would and many others on the pro-choice side). You seem to want to avoid that debate altogether. You seem to assume that you are not imposing your own limits on who gets rights and who doesnt. You take rights away from unfertilized eggs. Should I then claim that your arguments are just as bad as that of the slaveholders because you take it upon yourself to say that unfertilized eggs are not people and should not have rights?","Steeeeve","274961","and there is only one correct way to interpret a legal document. It happens to be the same way you interpret anything. I have a problem with people doing something that is wrong but I don't argue that you can't impose your will. You take the good with the bad in a democracy. Chemist never claimed this for one. And I deny you need a reasoned debate anyway.....I don't even know what a reasoned debate is to you. It seems when legislatures make laws they always have a debate then they vote. I'm lost on this...are you asking if reason plays a part in determining if something should be allowed to be pushed on another? If so, then reason is not a requirement to do so. I'd prefer that someone pushed the right thing rather than a faulty reasoned wrong thing. That doesn't make them any less of a proclamation. Reasons are debated but they don't have to be anything more than 'this is right'. hotly debated? Which ones??? Vietnam was debated like the war in iraq was. no, its not my main point. If you don't believe it then ignore it. Only if there is a standard by which they had to live up to. If they had debated and had to justify it in a Christian world view then they would have lost. If they had to justify it to society norms then they would have won. They did the latter. This is only true if there is an objective standard of who gets rights outside of what people create. They are no more supported than what the slaveholders had. You claim person means X and the slaveholders said person means Y. Both are just random claims that can't be justified but are the basis for your position. This is not true if you can show (or just claim) an outside standard that is true though. There is no evidence that would satisfy you as your have predefined person to exclude the fetus. At that point who wouldn't be for abortion. With slaveholders their definition excluded blacks and they had reasons which are just as wrong as yours. I certainly am imposing my own limits. I already told you I see no problem with this. I'm not using the argument ""don't impose your beliefs on me"" nor am I claiming a difference between human and person. You can claim what you wish though.","abortion-euthanization","07:44 PM","abortion-debates","146"

The issue is whether the view of the woman is being imposed on another person whose rights are superior to her own. Two issues. Is the fetus a person?

The fetus IS a persoon. Does its rights take priority over the woman? Rationally NO. The fetus is neither competent to assert its rights nor is it independent of its host. Under such an arrangement its the Hosts choice as to whether to accept the arrangement or not - its not the choice of the fetus. Even if you accord some rights to the fetus the human being represented by the woman should have priority - not the other way round.

Namely, if one considers that mental existence is important to the existence of rights, then third trimester fetuses (especially late in that term) could well have mental existence and, therefore, be as deserving of rights as a newborn baby. Yes, the fetus is imposing itself on the woman but the woman had at least five to six months to decide to get an abortion before that mental existence (and rights) kicked in. If she did not want to accept the responsibility over that mentally existing person, she should have aborted earlier. That is my view, anyway, and I think it is well defensible.","abortion-euthanization","09:49 AM","abortion-debates","150"
