"08-22-2007","10129",21,"Another opinion","279715","You seem to be thinking in extreme terms - i.e. either something can be proven 100% or it is faith. I strongly disagree. As an analogy, take a murder trial. If there is no evidence (via observations of various sort - witnesses, fingerprints, motive, etc.), then the probability of that particular person being guilty is quite small. However, the more evidence on has, the higher the probability of guilt. That does not mean that someone who has a lot of evidence stacked against him may not be innocent (and just being framed, for example, or unlucky). However, that probability is quite small and the relatively low statistics of innocent people being convincted shows this. Evidence is the APPEARANCE of something being true. It is usually not absolute proof. That doesn't make it useless. Far from it. So, am I understanding you correctly that you think that either something is proven 100% or its is faith? If so, then we might as well end this part of the discussion here and now since we are not speaking from a common perception of reality. As I said before, there are no absolute rules about who gets rights and of what type. This is determined by humans for both rational and irrational reasons. My stress of empathy comes from the fact that most of us are capable of it. Most appeals for rights that I have heard are appeals for people to empathize with the suffering of those without rights. Besides, I also have the reciprocity part of my moral stance - treating others as you expect to be treated. Even if you strongly dislike the others, that reciprocity part of the moral stance still holds. Thinking that someone is inherently inferior is not the same as that person BEING inherently inferior. That needs to be proven and the slaveholders would have been hard pressed to fully prove that blacks were INHERENTLY inferior. That is not INHERENT inferiority. Otherwise, if it is ONLY skin color that the slaveholders thought caused inferiority, then they would have to admit that, when they themselves would get their skin tanned by the sun, they would become inferior - there are obvious logical inconsistencies that they would have to face. Yes, I do not think there are absolute criteria for rights (just as there is no ABSOLUTE proof of any of our knowledge). However, methodoligy at getting at any decision is important. A well thought out decision (as in the decision about rights) will mainly yield more just results than an arbitrary decision. Most decisions that people make are not purely emotional value judgements or purely rational reasoning but a combination of the two, where those two types of thought are also often interdependent. Hitler was able to rally anti-semitic feelings, allowing him to lead the Holocaust, but the only reason he was able to get away with it is because German people believed the lies and propaganda he spread about Jews. Rational discussion would have been able to lay bare the falsehood of that propaganda. Similarly, most decisions should be based on as REAL an understanding of the relevant reality as we can get, and that is most achievable with fully rational discussion. THat is why I stress rational discussion - where rational discussion means that people base their decisions and understanding on the reasons and evidence presented in the rational discussion. Being stuck in a belief system (such as the slaveholders had about blacks) simply because one was raised that way is not rational if one does not truly weigh in all the opposing evidence. I fully realize that full rational discussion is not possible for many people. I simply feel that it should be held up as an ideal in our society since a culture that stresses rational discussion will be more likely to practice it. You cannot convince someone if they are not open to rational discussion - such as the murderous kid in this case.","Steeeeve","279915","I'd say in your murder example there are still elements of faith. That is why we go with ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". There is always some level of faith. I'm saying everything has a faith aspect to it. I disagree that empathy plays a role in who gets rights. It may be good for arguing why one should not be denied their rights but I would say they had rights before but were being denied them and thus the question becomes how did they get them. I disagree that empathy is the thing that grants rights. As for the circular argument I did not mean to say the definition is circular but the way you use it to deny the unborn rights is. I guess to avoid this you would need a valid reason why empathy is the means by which you have rights. Oh, I also disagree that it is always the case that people think of rights in terms of empathy. For example many people think marriage is right but you really can't play empathy into that very much. Furthermore, I am sure many do not have empathy for what happens to a person who abuses children but I'd still say they have rights. Finally, it still doesn't really address why we place a different level of rights on humans as opposed to beings that may have higher mental existence. Proven based on what? Surely you aren't suggesting there is a standard by which they have to prove. This would get us back into that circular arguing again. The only thing they would need to show would be that skin color is different and since the belief exists that black skin equals inferior then that is what plays out. Please understand though that I would still say that reasoning is wrong with my point being that your reasoning can't say it is. By your definition its not but that seems rather irrelevant. tanning your skin doesn't change your genetics but that is really beside the point. You seem to be suggesting a certain standard but are unwilling to say this is the standard. I think in the case of abortion you will always come out to an arbitrary decision because you make so many assumptions and statements of faith along the way. I'd argue that most decisions are based upon what makes a person comfortable (selfishness) with possible input from emotion and rational reasoning. Kind of an off the subject remark but how can you be so sure you aren't falling victim to believing things that may not be true in reality? A rational discussion on abortion would only lead us back to statements of belief. The thing is they thought they were having rational discussion and in a sense they were. It was the underlying beliefs that were wrong but the conclusions from those beliefs were very rational. I don't disagree that reasoning is a good thing but it does have many limitations and once you get to that point you are going by faith alone. It turns out that at this point if you have two different beliefs you either find a way to live with it or you decide which side will prevail. Sadly it took 750,000 lives to decide who's belief would prevail in the Civil War. But he would be open to rational debate I'm sure. You just need to understand that he is coming from a totally different belief structure. To the kid there is nothing rationally wrong with killing. If he/she grew up without empathy then what would be your argument? It seems hard to comprehend these things sometimes I realize but at some point you have to see that we all come from different backgrounds and that truly shapes the way you rationalize. In the end it still comes down to that basic belief structure and that seems to be the only disagreement between you and I.","abortion-euthanization","12:13 PM","abortion-debates","305"
