If they support killing a perfectly healthy unborn child, they will argue that the reason stated in the Op is the main reason Abortion is needed and justified. And I must say that if 98% of all abortions were performed for that reason, the public stance against them might not be so strong.","abortion-euthanization","11:59 PM","abortion-debates","3"

Abortion is not the same thing as euthanasia. Why don't you just say what is on your mind, rather than setting these ham-handed traps you hope someone will fall into? It is clear what your opinion is. If you have something to say, by all means express yourself.","abortion-euthanization","06:40 PM","abortion-debates","10"

One cannot show mercy to what constitutes mere tissue. One can show mercy to a human person. Suppose that the fetus in question has for example will have no functioning brain upon birth, then will aborting it constitute in any way the killing of a person. In sever anencephaly there is nothing there to be a person!","abortion-euthanization","03:10 AM","abortion-debates","13"
