Secondly, I made a statement. I don't recall making an argument with it. Seems the only thing weak here is your logic.","abortion-euthanization","02:00 PM","abortion-debates","198"
"08-01-2007","10129",14,"chemist99a","275957","Sure you can. A zygote is not even close to being a recognizable human. If I put your expertise to the test and asked you to tell me which among a set of zygotes placed before you were human and which were not - tis most likely you would fail. Just which morphological and anatomical characters of a zygote do you think makes it A HUMAN as opposed to human?","Steeeeve","275971","First tell me this, if something looks like a human does that make it so?","abortion-euthanization","02:02 PM","abortion-debates","199"
"08-01-2007","10129",14,"Another opinion","275967","People speak of human rights but human, there, is only used as a differentiation from animal. It is not meant to define when those rights begin in a human life form. It also uses the adjective ""human"" as opposed to the noun ""a human"", where human eggs are also human. Basically, you are playing a game of choosing those definitions which suite you to try to argue that a point is a fundamental truth. Even if one does claim that it refers to ""a human"", then there are multiple definitions of ""a human"" - only one of which is ""member of the species homo sapien"" which could be argued that a zygote is such a member (others might argue that ""member"" requires more than just a full set of DNA and the start of the growth process). Another definition of ""a human"" is ""a person"", which people interpret differently since the definition is not fixed. So your arguement is far from a fundamental truth. Stating it doesn't make it true. Your stating it doesn't make it true either. Women had far fewer rights than men for most of the history of the US. I am not at all convinced that they included women in this term, given the attitudes about women at the time. Considering that they didn't include blacks in equal rights either, this term seemed to be quite limited. What do you mean when you say what SUPPORTS observation? Unless one is experiencing a halucination or optical illusion, what one observes (the sky is blue today) is true. Psychologists have investigated enough people that they have a good representative sample by now. There conclusions are not just based on guesses. I presented empathy as a main motivation for rights because it is what I most often hear appealed to (many pro-life arguements included) when people argue that certain people should have certain rights. It also coincides with my own moral approach. There are no absolute rules about rights. Rights are assigned by groups and governments. It is just that empathy is what is used most often (either directly or indirectly) in arguing for particular rights.","Steeeeve","275974","If you don't think humans have fundamental rights then I feel sorry for you and it is no wonder we have had things like slavery and the holocaust. Your post certainly doesn't state you don't think humans have fundamental rights (although you have all but said it in the past) but it certainly implies it. I never said it did. I'm not here to give a lesson on what words mean but the context in which was given clearly indicates what that means. In any event the point was only to show that my line of thinking is not exactly out there. How does observation make something true? In fact, it seems observation has a pretty crappy track record. no, I believe we have empathy. I just don't see how that really matters to human rights. I have empathy for my cat but I don't think she deserves rights. Perhaps it is not a main motivation for rights but rather a means to ensure rights remain among others? In other words the emotion is not for creating rights but preserving them. How do you argue using empathy for someone that has no empathy for something? If I believe white people are property then I have no empathy for them. How would you use empathy to convince me they have rights?","abortion-euthanization","02:23 PM","abortion-debates","200"
"08-01-2007","10129",14,"Another opinion","275977","I would try to use logic to convince you that they are just the same as you are, since you are probable thinking about them as OTHER.","Steeeeve","275978","Exactly. You convince them they are human as well because this is what matters. What the purpose of rights are and who they apply to do not matter.","abortion-euthanization","03:25 PM","abortion-debates","202"
"08-01-2007","10129",14,"Another opinion","275977","When someone claims that something is a fundamental right, then the word ""fundamental"" implies truth in an absolute sense. Am I misinterpreting you or are you accepting that this fundamental right is just a view of you and many others, not an absolute truth?","Steeeeve","275980","No, I never claimed that me stating it made it true.","abortion-euthanization","03:37 PM","abortion-debates","203"

What the purpose of rights are and who they apply to do not matter.","Another opinion","275981","The reason I would convince the hypothetical you that whites are the same as you and therefore deserve rights is because of empathy and reciprocity. It is the ""How would YOU like it if YOU were treated that way"" arguement. Slaveholders, Hitler, and others who treated others badly would argue that this arguement does not apply because the Others DESERVE to be treated badly because of some generalized characteristic (just as one might argue that criminals DESERVE to be treated badly because of their actions). If you can use logic and reason to poke huge holes in their arguements about why ALL of the Others deserve to be treated badly, then you might be able to convince them. It is clear to me that the main difference in our views is a difference in approach. For me, reasons are important. For you, proclamations seem to be more important (ex. ""All humans have rights""). The reason I think that reasons are more important than proclamations is that basing law on proclamations alone can lead to grave injustice (as in the slaveholders proclamations that blacks are automatically inferior and therefore slavery is justified).","abortion-euthanization","03:41 PM","abortion-debates","204"

No where. If I feel they are no more important than my cat then how could I have empathy? There are only two answers here: 1) There is something built it to us that lets us know who is worthy of human rights or 2) You first convince someone that they are worthy of human rights. You are going in circles here. How would you convince someone they are like you unless you feel there is something about human that is worthy of certain rights while there is not for others. If this is the case then all that is important is that you convince them they are human. No, the difference is I realize that one can't reason everything and must have a basic belief system to work from. It is without this belief system that one uses oneself to establish proclamations that benefit them and leads to things like slavery. The reasons you provide are only circular in nature or unexplained. For example, why is it that empathy leads to rights for humans but not for fish? Or perhaps a better one would be why is empathy for an unborn less of an argument than empathy for a born?","abortion-euthanization","03:52 PM","abortion-debates","205"
