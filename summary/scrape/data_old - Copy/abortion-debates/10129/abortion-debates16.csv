"08-02-2007","10129",16,"Another opinion","276132","Rights are a social construct delegated by the societies that allocate them. They exist to begin with because the negative consequences associated with not having rights led underprivileged groups to demand their rights. They came about historically because some groups (Monarchy, Aristocracy, etc.) were treated by law in a far better manner than other groups (Merchant class, peasants, etc.) where the reasons given for the preferred treatment (ex. a claim of divine right) was not accepted by many people and was unsupportable. The people suffered under the reduced rights and were not given reasonable reasons for that. The rights typically came about because of comparison with the rights of privileged classes in arguments that basically came down to ""Why should THEY get to have these rights, and we don't"". These questions were being asked more often to begin with because of the influence of Enlightment thought, where it was thought that reason could explain everything in the world. Sometimes, this push for rights led to the classes with fewer rights gaining rights. Sometimes, it led to privileged classes losing rights (ex. losing the privilege not to pay taxes). Either way, it was the negative consequences of not having rights (suffering either mental or physical) that drove those with fewer rights to demand and win rights. Privileged classes usually had a wide range of reasons why they thought they should maintain their privileges but they used their political power to avoid being held accountable for those reasons. Therefore, things did not change until the people were fed up enough to use their own power of numbers in revolutions (17th Century English Revolution, 18th Century US and French Revolutions, etc.) and either open or assumed threat of revolution to force their rights to be accepted. Ultimately, the ideal became that all people should be viewed equally under the law. Again, this historical change was driven by the people who suffered under unequal rights. In practice, even in what is considered the ideal, rights are not perfectly equal but can be taken away for reasons. For example, children and severely mentally incapacitated adults have little control over their behavior and have very limited powers of reasoning. Therefore, their freedoms (ex. of movement, of major decisions) are restricted and few contest those restrictions (except for teenagers). Others, such as criminals, get rights taken away as a consequence to their actions. Sometimes rights are restricted because they interfere with the rights of others (ex. you dont have the right to take other peoples property). So, I would say that rights exist to begin with because of the negative consequence of not having rights (mental and/or physical suffering) and rights are unequal when there are debatable accepted reasons for those rights not to be equal (children, mentally incapacitated adults, criminals, etc.). Since rights exist to begin with because of the mental and/or physical suffering caused by not having rights, when rights are denied a particular group, then it is an appeal to the suffering of that group and the sense of Why are they excluded from rights you take for granted that is the common response. Part of this is an appeal to empathy and part is an appeal for fairness (equal rights unless you present a reason why they should not be equal). At least these are the appeals that have been used in debates on rights up to now. Without mental existence, most rights are irrelevant (ex. right to property, rights to act in certain ways, etc.). If one talks about rights of a non-mentally existing being to life, then the question arises what are the negative consequences of destroying that life? For a mentally existing being, mental and physical suffering could result. For a non-mentally existing being but one that could become a mentally-existing being, the consequences are the curtailing of the potential to grow into more. That is true both for early fetuses and for unfertilized eggs, just to different degrees since one is much farther along the process than the other. Since the traditional appeal to empathy for suffering does not work in this case, then one would need to appeal to the importance of the negative consequence of losing potential in comparison to the negative consequences of a woman being forced against her will to carry that fetus (which IS a traditional appeal to empathy). One would also have to explain where one would place the limit of the potential argument (early fetus vs unfertilized egg) and why. This is a very different arguement than has been used for gaining rights in the past and has shown itself to be a hard sell in situations where reasoned argument prevails, as opposed to religious or other proclamations. Marriage is a social construct. I wouldnt say that there is a right to marriage but if you grant it to one group of people then you have to have good reasons for not granting it to another. Any being that can suffer, feel pain, emotion, have experiences, etc. is a being that can be empathized with. It is harder to empathize with lower animals because we might well be attaching emotions and feelings to it that it is not capable of having. That is probably true for the ant. I can try to guess what it is feeling based on its actions but, without close consultation with scientists who have analyzed its neural network, I would probably be wrong in my guess. It is much easier with people (at least the normal range of people) since we ourselves have had similar experiences to those we would empathize with we would be much more likely to be accurate in our estimations of what they are experiencing and feeling. I would be open to discussing potential animal rights but would prefer if it were moved to another thread, since it would be too much of a tangent to this thread. There are many potentially related points we could address, but we have to keep in mind how much those points make us digress from the main point. You yourself have used this argument before, so I will use it here. Lets stick to the human species. It is UNSUPPORTED proclamations I am against. It is the support (reasons) behind the proclamations which are important. Which proclamations have I made which I have not tried to support with reasons?","Steeeeve","276140","So we are back to what is a person... I hope we aren't confusing legal and philosophical rights here. I disagree that those with handicaps have natural rights restricted. I also disagree that there ever was a ""right to take others property"". None of this answered my question about why you should get rights. Again, if you use empathy then we have done circular reasoning. I can show you how if you like. But this is simply a proclamation. You think rights are useless if you can't understand or feel anything if they are gone. I disagree. We are also using circular reasoning here. Why is empathy important...because that is what we use to create/give rights...well who gets those rights...those with mental existence...why is mental existence important...because we have empathy for certain beings. Round and round. You can look at that a few ways...anyone really is allowed to marry. This is more a side thing so we can drop it...I was just wondering if you thought it was a right. Is equality a right? It certainly is not a tangent. If you can't explain to me why empathy for one ""group"" is not as important than empathy for another group then you have violated your test that you gave me. It still is a proclamation anyway and if you want to stick with the human species then I suppose you admit then that the unborn is a member of the human species. This gets me back to the idea that one should never discriminate against any human and to do so would be just as bad as the slaveholders. Your reasons are basically that you believe in empathy and mental existence. Either way, it comes down to beliefs and any belief is by itself an unsupported proclamation which can only be supported by faith.","abortion-euthanization","02:31 PM","abortion-debates","227"

"08-03-2007","10129",16,"Another opinion","276164","No. How did you come to that conclusion from the section that you quoted? What are you calling ""philosophical rights""? Ideally, rights one derives from philosophical / rational arguements should be equal to legal rights. I though we were discussing what we thought actual (ultimately legal) rights SHOULD be and why. What do you think we are discussing? I didn't say those with handicaps have limited rights. People with paralized legs have just as many rights as anyone else. They just have limited mobiility that they try to get around with wheelchairs and ramps. I was talking about people with such limited mental capability (due to birth defects or brain damage) that, for example, they do not realize that it is dangerous to walk full speed into heavy traffic, or walk off a bridge to try to catch the pretty butterfly. They may want to go running after that butterfly but you restrict their rights for their own good by restricting their freedom of movement. I used the historical reasons why rights were introduced to begin with, and those had a lot to do with people wanting to avoid the suffering caused by limited rights and the sense of unfairness that someone just like them but who is born into a noble family should get rights that they don't because of bogus excuses (ex. divine rights). Rights do not exist as some perminent fixed abstract entity (I suspect you think they do). They are social constructs dictated by a society. From that point of view, it is important to note what drives societies to give rights to begin with. I just think that it is important that societies take all arguements into account when making decisions - which means debating the reasons until there is nothgin left to debate. Just because there were historical reasons for rights to exist does not mean that we have to restrict ourselves to the historical reason. However, if you want to deviate from historical motivations for rights, you need to present new compelling reasons. So, what are YOUR reasons for thinking that rights exist? Rights of a zygote to act in certain ways is irrelevant if it has no capability of ""acting"" anyway. Rights of freedom of speech for a zygote is useless if it has no capability of communicating. Other rights are useful such as a right to life of a zygote. However, such a right is just as useful for an unfertilized egg. The consequences of either a zygote or egg being destroyed are nearly the same. I do not have a fully explored theory on rights of animals so I cannot present one to you. Nobody has claimed other rights for animals in this thread so there is no compelling reason to address it. If this were a thread about animal rights, I would explore the reasoning. I might even be convinced by certain arguements. As it is, the subject is only tangentially relevant. I will try to think about it and address it if and only if you address the issue of why YOU think rights exist to begin with and answer my points, as I am answering yours. I don't know where you are getting this from. Please re-read my post. Is it irrelevant to you why rights were historically introduced in civilizations to begin with? I think that the reasons people introduced rights to begin with are very relevant to why rights exist now. I suspect you are unable to get around your idea of unsupported proclamations. The slaveholders similarly used unsupported proclamations to justify their stance (or at least did not allow any debate on the bogus reasons they gave for their proclamations).","Steeeeve","276260","You spoke of people getting rights and why...it only leaves the question of what a person is. I claim that blacks always had certain rights even if they were not legally recognized. I disagree they have restricted natural rights. This doesn't answer the question about why you should have rights. Still a proclamation as who cares what the consequences are. Part of this thread is exploring why one can have empathy for many living creatures yet give different rights to them. Seems this suggests another criteria is needed. Is it that you only have a certain amount of empathy for certain levels of ""mental existence""? If this is the case then some animals would beat out a new born baby in terms of rights they should get. It is irrelevant if you can't tell me the origin. The origin is a belief system. I agree they were unsupported but they problem was not that but rather they were untrue. I'm suggesting yours are both unsupported and untrue as well. The only support you have shown is a circular reasoning which is not actually support.","abortion-euthanization","01:25 PM","abortion-debates","233"
"08-03-2007","10129",16,"Another opinion","276263","I think that a major difference between our two views is that you think that there are some natural rights that are automatically inherent in people that exist external to any political structure. Indeed, I agree that the Declaration of Independence does imply natural rights. However, the trouble with the natural rights concept is that you are back to square one in trying to define what those rights are to begin with and when in the life of a human entity those rights start (unfertilized egg, zygote, early fetus, late fetus, birth, adulthood, etc.). Different philosophers who studied natural rights came up with different conclusions about which rights are natural rights. So, that brings us back to defining rights based on debated reasons for those rights, just as you would in the ideal case for legal rights. As the philosopher, Jonathan Wallace put it: I just think that, in debating reasons for having rights to begin with, it is important to view why rights were introduced historically. If one wants to include new reasons for rights, one can then introduce the reasons and debate them. As I said, I would be able to further debate this if and only if you would be willing to outline YOUR reasons for having rights to begin with. If you agree, then I will agree. I never agreed to a one-sided debate. It has to be two-sided. The origin is the motivations which drove people to demand rights to begin with, and the reasoning they used to push them. Here, I think we are again running into a difference in outlook. You think that there are natural rights that exist in some ideal abstract realm which automatically attach to people. I think that people of a group are the ones that determine rights for that group but, in order to make them as just as possible, one needs to fully debate the reasons behind those rights. And for that, historical reasons are what one looks at first.","Steeeeve","276310","I disagree with Wallace as he infers no natural rights in his statement. [QUOTE]If one doesn't believe in natural rights then I'd have to wonder how rights can ever stand by themselves.

You still didn't answer my question about why you deserve rights. (you personally that is) And yet I doubt you could show where these rights evolved or even worse why they should be preserved. Also, if rights are only the agreement among people then this gets us back to the question of why an agreement among people should change. And once again you come into circular reasoning.

The trouble is, how do you define those natural rights to begin with? By gut reaction? By religious creed? Is there a way to do it by pure reasoning (as some philosophers try to do)? I think that, though some things can be determined logically, others are based on value judgements (ex. value of the potential of an embryo vs a woman's right to her own body). If you claim that there is only one way of defining natural rights, then prove it by explaining that method. Otherwise, you will have to acknowledge that even the idea of natural rights are relative and depend on the reasoning or gut feelings of the particular philosopher. If natural rights are determined just by gut feeling, or particular religious creeds, then they are open to such a wide interpretation that injustice can easily creep in. For example, various traditional cultures automatically assume that women or people of different religions or ethnic groups do not get the same rights because it is ordained so by God. 2) Rights determined by full debated reasons and evidence, where applicable. : This is what I support since I think that it is the method which can lead to the most just system of rights. Debate does not mean that, in the end, someone can answer ""because I say so"" or ""because it is so"" or ""because such and such a book tells me so"". Debate means supporting everything one says with evidence or rational explanation. It may well be that the discussion will ultimately come down to a value judgement but at least the debate that one had along the way would have eliminated all or most of the bogus reasoning that most often leads to unjust systems of rights (such as the Southerners assumptions of the inherent inferiority of the African races). 3) The actual way rights are determined: The actual way rights are determined, at least in our Democracy, unfortunately includes the greatly flawed system where people often do not make decisions based on rational reasons but based on gut reaction, political allegiances, self interest indifferent to others, ego, etc. I agree to your concern in thinking that politically derived rights may be very unjust compared to the rights that many think one SHOULD have, since politically derived rights are rights that are set down by a very flawed system. Politics is what allowed the US to allow slavery for almost a full century.","abortion-euthanization","02:57 PM","abortion-debates","238"
"08-04-2007","10129",16,"chemist99a","276401","And also what allowed the US to eventually discard that system. And it may be that absent keeping slavery for a century there would have been no US in the first place. No system like ours can start out at the ideals. It takes time for the system to converge towards a better set of solutions, and we have improved you know. Perhaps we can continue to do so at least by our own assessment of such things.","Another opinion","276404","I agree that we have improved and that the trend in politics has generally been toward a more just system. However, I think it is important that the real political system keep in mind what the ideal, in my view, SHOULD be - namely, a system where decisions truly take all arguements and evidence into account, weighing the pros and cons. I am afraid that we are losing touch with that ideal, and that can be dangerous for our democracy. What I am particularly afraid of is the non-insignificant numbers of the religious right who would impose their will on others based on religious creed, not rational arguement. I am afraid when I look at this administration which so often has ignored the reality of the situation (such as the fact that Iraq wouldn't just neatly fall into peaceful Democracy grateful to America as soon as Saddam was toppled). Decisions have been made too often by gut reaction, political creed, and not debated understanding of the pros and cons of particular actions. If we lose track of the ideal and don't hold our leaders accountable to try to stick to that ideal, then our democracy is bound to degenerate.","abortion-euthanization","04:03 PM","abortion-debates","240"
