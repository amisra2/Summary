There will be new cases and new arguments endlessly should that happen. And the composition of the court may change more rapidly than one expects. For example the chief justice recently suffered a siezure even though he is younger than all the other judges. One can never tell exactly what conditions will prevail tomorrow.","abortion-euthanization","04:41 PM","abortion-debates","376"
"08-24-2007","10129",26,"chemist99a","280346","Actually we DO use a form of risk assesment with regard to justifiable homocide. If you are held at gunpoint or your life is threatend and the threat is credible then you may justifiably kill the assailant. However if someone looks at you crosseyed on the street even if you find that threatening you are NOT justified in killing him. At least if you use that defense in court you will fail. The risk ratio in that case is of course implicity determined by the court proceeding. However I am reasonably certain that in border line cases prosecuters and defenders have argued over the real risks involved in specific situations and most likely introduced expert testimony on both sides of the issue! For example you kill sombody who physically pushes you out of your drivers seat and takes you and your car on a chase. Should you kill him I would FERVENTLY hope that your defense attorney could produce statistical evidence as to the probability that the hijacker would likely subjected you to serious harm should you not have killed him. Or perhaps you would complain if he did so - bad idea IMHO. In any case the risk ratio may not be established in the courts (they really hate unambiguous numbers you know - I speak from experience) but it certainly can and does play a role in making case by case decisions. I don't do capital cases, but from my work in other criminal areas I know that risk assessment is often an issue before courts.","richbrmly","280359","I agree, but Doctors can't play that. And thats the issue. Doctors have to live off numbers, or their job will differ from Doctor to Doctor. We as a people in the United States have set up a justice system that will only punish even a killer if we can obtain a preponderance of evidence against them. It is better to let 1000 people go free than let one person be punished who is innocent. So to say what ever ratios of abortions occur that someone has determined by their standards to be unnecessary has no meaning. Its the persons life that is saved that has meaning. Choice, which has been right where Jesus was born, and has been the law of land far longer than the Christian Jehodists concept. Now, if you say sure, there where abortions in Roman controlled areas but the people choose not to do so. Then there ya go. Choice! Not a Jehodist concept of sharia where you force Dogma on the masses.","abortion-euthanization","05:11 PM","abortion-debates","378"
"08-24-2007","10129",26,"richbrmly","None","The deaths happen. Clearly they happen. Your saying the state must prevent choice. But you also clearly say the state must consider health risks...You can't do that with a blanket statement like that. 1.3 million women last year had a health risk and carried to term. They made a choice. when does the issue of choice happen? Lets say for your daughter. When should she be allowed by law to have a choice??","Phyllis","280361","Yes, I think the state may legitimately prevent choice, and I also think that it ought to do so. I would not allow abortion for health reasons (broadly defined). I would only allow it if it were necessary to preserve maternal life. And I can do that with a blanket statement. It has historically been so in our legal and moral traditions. Have you not been reading anything that I have said? Abortion should only be an option when necessary to save maternal life. It should not be available for trivial reasons such as gender selection.","abortion-euthanization","05:14 PM","abortion-debates","379"
"08-24-2007","10129",26,"None","None","None","richbrmly","280365","If you are telling me a fetus is a baby. Youre telling me my country, The United States of America should allow a mother to kill her baby if it will save her life. That is what you would be telling me; my Country whom my father fought for! That is so sick; my stomach is turning as I type. No woman would ever die for a fetus. Why?? Its madness! They do die for what a fetus will become and that is exactly the question they would ask their doctor. What are the chances for the fetus? Does it have a chance to come to term? You are making a mockery of the sacrifice women have made for their children. Some heroic women have chosen to continue a gestation process. Knowing what would come of it. How can you say this to anyone?? NoThe country does not allow women to kill their babies even if it would save their lifes, it can not happen. It is beyond reasoning that any human being would suggest such an evil thing!","abortion-euthanization","05:29 PM","abortion-debates","381"
"08-24-2007","10129",26,"richbrmly","280330","Before the advent of abortion the numbers where staggering higher. Like in Mexico where if you use population and death rates, your jaw would drop. Naturally we would face the same stats but at a much higher dayly rate. This is why; If the country is to outlaw abortion, then we would have to come up with a risk factor (factor means ratio) for those women we would allow the liberty of choice. I know and you know you can get the numbers; A boat load of agences record and monitor this. But your mind is fogged and your concept of women having equal liberties to live are muted at best.","Steeeeve","280380","So do you concede your numbers regarding illegal abortion deaths were wrong? 11,000 births day a day in the US with 1 out of 10,000 as the maternal death rate. Keep feeding us those ""facts""....I'll keep knocking them down.","abortion-euthanization","06:33 PM","abortion-debates","386"

So, even if that is what I have said, why would you be sick to your stomach? But regardless, let me try to settle your topsy-turvy mind. I have not said that a mother should be allowed to kill her baby in order to save her life. What I said, periodically, is that abortion should only be an option to preserve maternal life. I say that as shorthand. In the very rare circumstance where a mothers life is jeopardized by a pregnancy, the physician should save the life that he can save. In the rare circumstance where a pregnancy threatens a mothers life, the physician will have the option of acting to save the mothers life, which will have the unfortunate and costly result of killing her child; or the physician will have the option of trying to save the life of the child, which will have the unfortunate and costly result of killing the mother. In these scenarios, my understanding is that the latter scenario is never likely. If the physician were to opt to try and save the childs life, both the child and the mother would die. That being the case, the physician should act to save the mothers life. This is not at all shocking. It is similar to the scenario where a student walks into a classroom building and opens fire on unsuspecting students. When the ordeal is over, paramedics enter the scene to find several people seriously injured. In this situation the paramedics try to save the lives that they can save. Does that mean the other lives were less valuable? No. Is there some ethical absurdity to saving the lives that can be saved? No. What are you talking about? Most (not some) women have chosen to continue the gestation process knowing what would come of it. You are a sophist. But I have played your game. I have spent my time talking to you about the rarest abortions known to humanity. I have endured your shifting reasoning and sophistical argument. I have been consistent. You make a claim, and I refute it. You make another claim, and I refute it. Youve drawn faulty conclusions from your faulty facts. And I have played your game. Now, I wonder if you will address some things. Lets begin with you addressing whether you believe a woman should be allowed to have an abortion for the reason of gender selection. If not, would you prevent her from doing so?","abortion-euthanization","06:38 PM","abortion-debates","387"
"08-24-2007","10129",26,"richbrmly","280345","Even the Bible is clear on the mater.","Steeeeve","280383","Wow, we agree on something. Chances are you will say it supports abortion but undoubtedly you are wrong. I'll await your ""proof"" of this claim and then destroy that argument as well since I already know what you will post. Its fun having new people","abortion-euthanization","06:43 PM","abortion-debates","388"
