I was merely pointing out the difficulty of actually establishing a rational boundary on the beginnings of human beings - especially the case that human life itself is continuous and without actual breaks. If breaks existed the chain would be broken and could not continue. Any child born is the product of an unbroken chain of living human cells going back to the earliest human beings.

I have often tried to challenge pro-life people about which specific changes from unfertilized eggs to fertilized eggs cause that life form to go from a non-person to a person (or from a living entity without rights to one with rights). Ultimately, in a previous thread, Steeeeve said that it was the existence of the soul in the zygote that made the difference. That is ultimately a religious arguement. Outside of the religious argument, there is simply the proclamation that ""zygote=person"" and ""person gets rights"" therefore ""zygote gets rights"". No objective secular reasoning is presented. Were the arguement restricted to secular reasoning, the pro-life arguement would almost surely lose. I suspect that Steeeve's main objection to the debate being based on reason is that religious reasoning is excluded. I suspect that, if religious reasoning were allowed, then he would have less of an objection to a reasoned debate. Steeeeve, if you are reading this, then you are encouraged to comment on that point.","abortion-euthanization","02:51 PM","abortion-debates","182"

The scientific arguement can counter claims such as the slaveholders made in claiming that African races were inherently inferior in intellect, control over behavior, etc., through the Science of Psychology. In religious reasoning, all you can really point to is quotations from a text that is considered sacred and unquestioned, and discuss interpretations of various such quotations. Of course, none of that can be taken as evidence if they cannot prove the validity of the sacred text to begin with.","abortion-euthanization","11:11 PM","abortion-debates","184"

For most of its history, ensoulment was thought to happen at ""quickening"", not at conception. It was only in the 19th century that abortion started being considered murder from conception on. A good web site which summarizes the history (with supporting references) is: http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_hist.htm So, religious reasoning and Scriptural interpretation varied during Church history - even though they were talking about the same text, the Bible. As for the general subject of views being imposed on a populace: I think, in general, the great majority of people have SOME level of logic in discussing reasons behind their views. Even the worst dictators and murderers had some justification in mind when they committed their heinous acts - though in nearly all cases, it would have been hard for them to support their reasons with evidence. I think that is what would limit the extent of brutal behavior in people and nations, were full rational supportable debate allowed - the desire of most people to justify their behavior with logical reasons. Logical reasons depend on one's assumptions. Religious reasoning is ultimately based on faith (which is essentially traditional guesses) and is not supportable with empirical evidence, as Scientific reasoning is. Therefore, despite many good influences that have come from religion, religious reasoning has also been a major cause of various brutal conclusions and actions. Scientific and secular reasoning, on the other hand, could potentially have stopped many of the brutal treatments of the past by proving to the Southerners that blacks are indeed not automatically inferior because of their race, by proving to Hitler that it was only a small subset of Jews that were responsible for Germany's loss during World War I (and other accusations he held against the Jews) not all of them, by provint to the Aztecs and Mayans that human sacrifice plays no role whatsoever in the movement of the sun, etc. Scientific and secular reasoning may not guarantee a world that we would all be happy with, but it would have eliminated many of the injustices that this world has historically experienced. As for the question of when rights start: Yes, one cannot prove what a person is by science, but one can include a list of important criteria for why creatures get rights, argue why those criteria are important, and then use science to support claims as to when some of those criteria arise.","abortion-euthanization","10:33 AM","abortion-debates","186"

Sources say Beijing plans to spend roughly $1 billion over 10 years to establish an international center for stem cell research and regenerative medicine. Six U.S.-based Chinese scientists--including Xiangzhong Yang of the University of Connecticut, Storrs, and Ray Wu of Cornell University--proposed the center in a letter to the government last September. Yang argues that China can soon reach the vanguard in stem cell research because the country is not encumbered by religious concerns about cells derived from embryos. ""The challenge now is to find the right people,"" adds Wu. An official at China's Ministry of Science and Technology declined to confirm approval of the center, which has not been made public, but he says details are being worked out and the center would be under the ministry. The center would carry out both basic and clinical research, with the ultimate goal of developing therapies, Yang envisions.","abortion-euthanization","06:23 PM","abortion-debates","187"

"07-31-2007","10129",13,"Another opinion","275291","Human unfertilized eggs are human, they are just not defined as ""a human"" since they do not have a complete set of human DNA (just half) and since they haven't started the growth process. YOU are the one that is claiming that ""a human"" automatically needs to be a criteria. There is nothing automatic about it. Also, if those two criteria (full set of DNA and start of growth process) are what you require to determine rights (since those are the only criteria that fertilized eggs have which unfertilized eggs do not), then that is just as arbitrary as slaveholders saying that only whites get rights. The fact that one does have empathy is supported by the science of psychology. Different people use empathy to different degrees, but, according to psychologists, the great majority of people have the capacity for empathy. If, as a society, we prefer having people help each other out and try to limit situations where people suffer, then empathy is an emotion that it would make sense to encourage since it could be effective in achieving that goal.","Steeeeve","275846","A human is deserving of certain rights is just a fundamental truth....even the DOI states this. To say a tree is a human is wrong and to say a human egg is a human is wrong or to say a black person is not a human is wrong. The slaveholders tried to make a difference in human and person as you do. I don't make a difference. And what is psychology supported by? Not only that, not everyone has empathy. Finally assuming psychology is a truth where does psychology say empathy therefore the suffering get rights? But not everyone..interesting. And what on earth does empathy have to do with any of this?","abortion-euthanization","12:54 PM","abortion-debates","190"
"08-01-2007","10129",13,"chemist99a","275896","Be aware that A HUMAN is not equivalent to human. For example a bottle of human blood is human but not a human. One could readily conclude that a zygote is NOT a human.","Steeeeve","275937","No, no you can't.

"08-01-2007","10129",13,"Another opinion","275890","You claim that it is a fundamental truth that all humans down to zygotes have rights. That is obviously not universally accepted. Also, where, in the DOI, does it say that all humans have rights? All I see is ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights..."". As a matter of fact, if one takes the DOI literally, then only men are created equal, so women don't count apparently. Anyway, the DOI is praised not because it is the basis to our view on morality but because it is the founding document in our country in telling the Brits to bugger off. Psychology is supported by evidence - mainly observation, some limited experimentation, and statistical surveys. Psychologists claim that a distinguishing mark of psycopaths is that they do not have empathy. Also, psychology does not address the issue of rights. I am trying to understand your question. It was a response to my quoted post, in which I wrote, ""If, as a society, we prefer having people help each other out and try to limit situations where people suffer, then empathy is an emotion that it would make sense to encourage since it could be effective in achieving that goal. "" What, in that analysis, are you challenging?","Steeeeve","275939","I said it was a fundamental truth that humans have rights. this doesn't make it not a truth. An understanding of the word ""men"" would show that this word was and still is used as a genderless term. And how does ""endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights"" not equate to all humans have rights? Men = humans. ok, what supports observation? What makes this the means by which something is true? Also, if psychology does not address rights then why use it to address who gets rights? The idea that empathy has anything to do with who gets rights.","abortion-euthanization","10:54 AM","abortion-debates","194"
