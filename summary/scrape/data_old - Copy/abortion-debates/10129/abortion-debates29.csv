"08-31-2007","10129",29,"Winston Smith","281619","The doctrine of states' rights has been the cause of bitter controversy at several periods in U.S. history. Before the American Civil War (1861-1865), supporters of the doctrine generally held that the federal government was only a voluntary compact of the states, and that the latter could legally refuse to carry out federal enactments that they regarded as unconstitutional encroachments on their sovereignty. In the early days of the United States, loyalty to ones state often took precedence over loyalty to ones country. A New Yorker or a Virginian would refer to his state as my country. The Union was considered a voluntary compact entered into by independent, sovereign states for as long as it served their purpose to be so joined. In the nations early years, neither North nor South had any strong sense of the permanence of the Union. New England, for example, once thought of seceding, or leaving the Union, because the War of 1812 cut off trade with England.","Another opinion","281693","Do you think that there would have been any reasonable probability of the South seceding for issues other than slavery? More specifically, if the institution of slavery were never threatened, would they have still seceded? From all I have read so far, my understanding was that, despite having some other issues with the north, slavery was by far the largest cause of the secession.","abortion-euthanization","11:09 AM","abortion-debates","421"

""States rights"" was just a made up issue after the fact and no on really believed that.","abortion-euthanization","11:16 AM","abortion-debates","422"
"08-31-2007","10129",29,"Steeeeve","281581","Yes, it only takes a spark..in this case it happened to be one state leaving the union. I don't count a spark as a reason just like you don't count a gun being fired as the reason a war starts.","Another opinion","281697","It very much depends on what actions the North would have taken to try to stop slavery. The ideas of Lincoln and the Republican party were ideas that would have kept the elimination of slavery legal, from a constitutional sense, but their ideas still would have led to the elimination of slavery. It is certainly possible that the South would have precipitated a war or at least a secession (that would lead the north to war) to avoid giving up the lucrative enterprise of slavery. If they hadn't seceded after Lincoln's election then they might well have seceded years or decades later once his anti-new-slave-state policies produced anti-slave political majorities. On the other hand, perhaps those decades would have led to a re-assessment of their organization of slaves and a reorganization into something more akin to the sharecropper system. I admit that it would be unlikely that the South would have taken the elimination of slavery lying down and most likely would have seceded once the North made any strong attempt at getting rid of slavery. Also, I doubt that the North would have allowed slavery to continue indefinitely. There was just too much momentum against it and we were one of the only countries left that still supported it. So, I would say that you are probably right that the issue of slavery was destined to lead to war, but, still, that is far from absolutely certain since there could have been alternative paths.","abortion-euthanization","11:19 AM","abortion-debates","423"

I continue to claim that BOTH caused the civil war. The issue of slavery caused secession which, in turn, caused the civil war. Secession was not the only option that the slave states had to the election of Lincoln and the eventual threat that posed to slavery. It was just the only option they found palatable at the time. As Winston Smith said, and as I have heard on various History Channel programs, before the Civil War, the federal government wasn't nearly as strong as it is today and most people felt more of an allegance to their state than to the country. States had more rights and more sovereignty than they do today, so the idea of secession was not just made-up but a real political reality.","abortion-euthanization","11:25 AM","abortion-debates","424"
