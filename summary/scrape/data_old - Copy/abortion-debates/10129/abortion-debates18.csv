They are a particular kind of human being. They are dead human beings. And if they are not dead human beings, then what would your scientific self classify them as?","abortion-euthanization","06:45 PM","abortion-debates","260"

I would say they lack being , they lack an existence that you and I have. So, while they are human they are not human beings .","abortion-euthanization","06:48 PM","abortion-debates","261"
"08-07-2007","10129",18,"Sigma","276703","It would suggest that my criteria is more reasonable, or more appealing, than yours.","Steeeeve","276862","Perhaps more appealing but not more reasonable. I don't even know that your view is a majority view. And you of all people should know a majority doesn't make something right.","abortion-euthanization","10:51 AM","abortion-debates","262"
"08-07-2007","10129",18,"chemist99a","276701","Well steveeeeeee..... its your criterion not mine. You are the one who postulated that human DNA is pretty much the only scientific requirement for a human being. That you got called on such an obviously absurd statement is your fault not mine. Of course if you wish to retract your claim you can still salvage things - but that seems most unlikely.","Steeeeve","276864","embarrassing. You have been here long enough to understand terms...so why don't you?","abortion-euthanization","10:54 AM","abortion-debates","263"
"08-07-2007","10129",18,"chemist99a","276867","Steveeee..... those are your original words. You clearly set human DNA as being the primary requirement for being a human being. Now its possible I misunderstood but its difficult to see how. Your words are your words and words have meaning and communicate information. What would you change to clarify your view? Are you really asserting that say the Ice Man (which does contain human DNA) remains a human BEING even though the being died long ago??? Do you think thats reasonable or rational? How do you rationalize this?","Steeeeve","276871","human being noun 1. any individual of the genus Homo, esp. a member of the species Homo sapiens. 2. a person, esp. as distinguished from other animals or as representing the human species: living conditions not fit for human beings; a very generous human being. Stop playing dumb, it gets annoying really quickly.","abortion-euthanization","11:34 AM","abortion-debates","266"

And you of all people should know a majority doesn't make something right.","Sigma","276885","Well, certainly my criteria is more reasonable in the sense that it does not include entities such as the dead and human vegetables, which most reasonable people would agree are qualitatively different from you or I in some way. It also follows the ""common sense"" feeling that what makes us unique has more to do with our mind, brain, consciousness, etc instead of just our DNA. Your criteria has more problems it must try to explain away than mine in the philosophical arena.","abortion-euthanization","12:37 PM","abortion-debates","268"
