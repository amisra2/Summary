The nation finally reached a consensus on the human rights status of slaves even though it took a nasty war to do it. Do you wish to go to civil war over abortion?","richbrmly","280412","I would choose life first and foremost. No civil war. But do you think they'll stop at just taking over the United States? They'll have the most powerful Army a secular nation has ever developed. What will they do to China and so on? Europe, who is to host the Anti-Christ by their teachings? Do you really think they'll just stop the take over and just kill Americans? The rivers of blood will not end unless the dragon Conquers the earth.

What is the worth of a man that follows Jesus because he walked on water? Or out of his grave? I dont know what Jesus did. How could I? I was not present. I also know, no one else knows. So what is the worth of anyone that sells something they did not witness? What I do know is what I read. I dont follow Jesus because he floated in a cloud. That is for weaker men. I follow Jesus because I found value in what he said. Its what he said that counts to me. Thats why I take up MY cross. Its my cross that I take upYou cant take up your cross and follow after it. I pray OUR father. Our father means I have a father in heaven. Like others should. I got it. I understood what Jesus was saying and yes, I became born again. Rebirth has nothing to do with walks on water. NOTHING - Never did and never has. Pro-choice means I dont command the death of anyone; anyone at all. But Pro-life does and will cause the deaths of women. The deaths will be counted. The number will be known. Taking up your cross means something. Dont take up other mens Crosses you dont know what youre in for. Take up your cross. Care about people. Jesus was not against thinking, or Governments or armies. He was against two basic things; greed and Pharisees. This is all he ever attacked. Do you really think Pharisees dont exist anymore? Course they do. They tell you not to harm your family and cheat on their wifes. They chase little kids and start things to protect them. The most suppressive thing on the earth is a church state and they are never taken down. Rome, IranIts a chain on man and keeps him from finding God. Your body is the templeI get it Give to those who askGet it My kingdom is not a part of this world.Get it Born AgainI get it What I dont get is how the Christians can try and turn the saints from God. Dont get it. Not connecting here.","abortion-euthanization","09:26 PM","abortion-debates","396"

Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it. So what is the worth in following Jesus if its to save your life? Faith is not the game, being driven by the reason of self preservation means you're empty. God Is no respecter of religion. If he was there would only be one. God is all heart. And your heart or soul is what Jesus will look at and say he knows you. Or he does not know you. Because in the end its all you are and how you will be remembered. Discipline is fine, without heart its just bad. Love is all forgiving and can remember no wrong. You have to become Love. Thats born again...You become God like. Followers can not do that. They are wolfs that do as the pack would do.","abortion-euthanization","11:46 PM","abortion-debates","399"
"08-27-2007","10129",27,"Another opinion","None","Well, I admit that some people on the pro-choice side can also go too far on occasion, and occasionally I call them on it - admittedly not often enough. Where chemists arguement of ""don't push your beliefs on me"" was concerned, I recognized that arguement as being about unsupported beliefs, not ANY beliefs, which turned out to be what he really meant, when I asked him in a later post . If he had meant that people cannot push any views on others, then I would have disagreed with him since people have a right to push a view if they have supporting arguements and evidence for that view.","Steeeeve","280983","I want to address this first because I think any reasonable person could see the part in bold is just not true. After we had gone over how ridiculous the reasoning is you provided an alternative that at least makes some sense and then asked him if he really meant that. I find it hard to believe that he really meant that when you were the one that came up with the reasoning. Furthermore he still says it as in ""don't push your beliefs on me"". Finally, this isn't a case of unsupported beliefs being imposed (at least to the extent a belief can be supported) so the argument need not be brought up to begin with. I could give more examples of bogus reasoning but I think it would be good if we both called others on it more often. We don't exactly have a lot of pro-life folks on the abortion forums now so it might be one-sided but not much one can do about that.","abortion-euthanization","11:12 AM","abortion-debates","402"
"08-27-2007","10129",27,"Another opinion","280981","That may be the basis behind our difference in perspectives. At least my stance is consistent. I can understand your hesitation in answering this question since, in the murder case analogy, you would probably feel obliged to say that evidence does count, whereas agreeing that evidence does count in our knowledge about origins of humanity, supernatural beliefs, ... then that same stance about evidence would go against your beliefs. I follow the results of evidence, which has been a pretty good indicator of reality up to now The less evidence one has, the more uncertainty one has. With no evidence, one is left with belief without evidence - defined as faith. I occasionally allow my self leaps of faith, but I do not pretend to be certain about them. I would not be able to be intellectually honest if I claimed certainty in beliefs of faith. Where views based on evidence are concerned, then large amounts of evidence convince me. I do not believe every scientific theory is true - the string theory in Physics comes to mind (Occam's razor arguement) - just the ones that are well supported by evidence. I knew from the beginning that your views were not limited to you. However, I know that many of your views are based on religious beliefs. If you were not trying to impose your largely religious-based views on the populace at large via laws, then I would not be arguing as strongly against them. My stance is that laws need to be based on rational, supportable (with evidence) arguements. Our founders were wise in separating church and state. Heck, even Jesus said ""Let Caesar have what belongs to him, and God have what belongs to him"". But that is the trouble - there is disagreement on what they are, where pro-choice proponents would view a right to ones own body as an essential part of liberty. After all, if the state can control what one does with ones own body, then what does one have left to control - only the mind? Empathy is different than sympathy, where you are talking about sympathy. Empathy is a realization that others have similar feelings and reactions. However, if you recognize the fact that they might suffer, then you have to think about the consequences of that. Apparently, many slaveowners didn't empathize with their slaves in realizing that they had the same feelings and reactions as any white person would have had in that situation. Some did realize that and didn't care because of their own greed and self-interest. Then, they had to think of contorted ways to justify that oppression. Again, I stress empathy as a main driving force since that is what was most appealed to (directly or indirectly) historically in the fight for rights. First, I am only arguing againt the purely skin color argument since you were the one who introduced it in this discussion (i.e. that the slaveholders could have used skin color alone as an arguement). My goal was to show the inconsistencies in that arguement. As for my arguement, I am not argueing that ""you gain rights the more developed your brain gets"". I am arguing that there is a point at which rights start, in my view, and that is the first possibility of mental existence since mental existence is critical, in my view, to the existence of rights. Similarly, you say that rights start when there is a complete set of DNA and when the growth process starts. Both of our views acknowledge a point where rights begin. If everyone thought that 2 + 2 = 3, then they would all agree that 2 + 2 = 3 since nobody would be arguing otherwise. However, in such a situation, nobody would feel a sense of injustice. Open mindedness is hard to prove, but it can be demonstrated by people letting their minds be changed by full rational discussion. If someone holds a belief that cannot stand up to scrutiny, then there is a large chance that that belief is wrong.","Steeeeve","280992","You distort what I said and my stance is perfectly consistent. I don't doubt we use evidence and things like that for a murder case because it is the best system we have but that doesn't speak to how much faith is involved in 2 unique situations. This assumes you known what reality is. Of course you have no way of knowing this and thus even that is based on faith. But even those have elements of faith in them which was the point of this argument. If we relate this to the abortion forum then I'd say there is nothing but faith. There is no evidence supporting the idea that mental existence is important in giving rights and for that matter there is no evidence that we are to have rights. This can get us back into the murder of an adult question and why is that illegal. There is no evidence to support why some humans are valuable and not allowed to be killed other than a belief this is wrong. As for ""rational""...my belief on abortion is the only rational conclusion from my belief structure just like your belief is the only rational conclusion from yours. I disagree that separation of church and state means that one set of beliefs is not permitted in government. There is no trouble there. The constitution sets up a system to solve the issue...vote on it. If a pro-choicer finds different then convince the people and change the law. I'm not sure why people are fixed on the idea that democracy doesn't work. That is not exactly true. It is a feeling brought on by another's situation. It has nothing to do with whether another has similar feelings to you or not. Again, I think you distort the meaning of empathy here. Nevertheless, this still doesn't address how you get a slaveholder to empathize with a slave. Furthermore it doesn't speak to where the rights come from. I agreed that empathy can be a tool for fighting for rights but that hardly establishes how the right came to be and who deserves it anyway. If you want to get picky with it then just say you get rights if you are not of that natural skin color (ie black). I thought it was clear this is what I meant. I would claim that everyone would be wrong and thus everyone committed an injustice (assuming that wrong was an injustice I suppose). This does bring up an interesting point regarding a relative belief system. I still maintain that such a system would never allow one to say another is wrong or cant' do something. Your final sentence would imply there is such thing as as right and wrong.","abortion-euthanization","12:51 PM","abortion-debates","403"
