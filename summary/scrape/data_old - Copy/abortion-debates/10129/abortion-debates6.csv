"07-18-2007","10129",6,"chemist99a","274334","The constitution always overrules the majority and the representatives are checked and balanced in what they may and may not do. Not true in pure democratic rule you know. I am not imposing my belief on you or anyone else so far as abortion goes. Its a matter of individuals making their own moral decisions freely and voluntarily. I neither tell you that you must have an abortion or that you must refrain from one. In what way does that impose any belief of mine upon you? It does not do so.","Steeeeve","274347","the constitution doesn't always overrule a majority and still, the whole system is based on the idea of a majority...and in some cases the ""super majority"". But you are. You can't just claim someone is not a person and therefore say you are not imposing beliefs on them. If this were the case then I'd just say you aren't a person and therefore when I hurt you it wouldn't be wrong. Would you agree with this statement? I neither tell you that you must have a slave or that you must refrain from having one. In what way does that impose any belief of mine upon you? It does not do so.","abortion-euthanization","07:33 PM","abortion-debates","81"
"07-18-2007","10129",6,"chemist99a","274348","This of course utterly ignores a third party who is clearly and umistakabely a person - namely the slave. The proper analogous formulation would be - you may be a slave if you choose to but I will not require you to be a slave. You are making (or imposing) a dubious assumption that the fetus IS a person and objectively so. Slaves are persons, feti are not clearly persons. You are not logical in attempting to obsecure the primary issue.","Steeeeve","274386","They weren't considered persons then. This was the so called ""convention"" that you think is important. So I ask again, given the fact slaves were not considered persons at the time would you agree with the below statement: I neither tell you that you must have a slave or that you must refrain from having one. In what way does that impose any belief of mine upon you? It does not do so.","abortion-euthanization","10:11 PM","abortion-debates","83"

Just express your own opinion and leave others to express their opinion. You have made yourself look silly - and you being a moderator As I have already said, if you want to answer for all sides, stand in front of a mirror and debate with yourself.","abortion-euthanization","09:03 AM","abortion-debates","84"

These included the claim that they were like children and couldn't govern themselves, that they were automatically inferior in mind and behavior because of their race, etc. It was an irrational approach based only on wishful thinking and not on investigated evidence which caused a lot of suffering among the enslaved black population. What was the consequence of an acknowledged person's rights being taken away? In the case of African Americans, the consequence that most of us see is the suffering it caused them - both the pain of the overseers whip and physical hardships of a slave life, and the mental anguish of living a life over which one has no control and being constantly disrespected and insulted simply because of the color of one's skin. Abolitionists thought this was bad and their empathy with the suffering of the slaves eventually drove the US to outlaw slavery. What do you think are the consequences of an early fetus - prior to having mental existence - having no rights?","abortion-euthanization","09:56 AM","abortion-debates","85"

In any event, the point is the ""convention"" at the time was they were not people. So if one is going to say the convention is what tells us who a person is then there would never be anything wrong with slavery and anyone wishing slavery banned would be trying to ""impose your will on others"". This exact argument was used then and is used now. I just find it amazing that the arguments used in slavery are the EXACT same as the ones used for supporting abortion...at least in the ones chemist99a has presented. So I ask again to chemist99a, given the fact slaves were not considered persons at the time would you agree with the below statement: I neither tell you that you must have a slave or that you must refrain from having one.

Weren't you just telling me that ""person"" could never really be defined? No you are just rationalizing ways to make the fetus not a person much like it was rationalized that blacks were not persons. You'd think that the past would reveal the truth and history has shown us that NEVER has declaring something human but not a person, declaring sub human, or declaring someone an unworthy person ever been right. From Jews to blacks to any slaves and now to the unborn and probably soon the handicapped.","abortion-euthanization","02:14 PM","abortion-debates","89"

The abolitionists drew support to their cause because of people's sympathy for the suffering of the slaves, not because of some abstract rule. The book ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" was a major draw for the abolitionist movement. Why? Was it because of an abstract concept? No, it was because people saw this good man being treated so badly. They had SYMPATHY for his SUFFERING. THAT and the similar treatment of thousands upon thousands of slaves was seen as a bad consequence of slavery and the loss of most rights. Also, you have not answered my question: What do you think are the consequences of an early fetus - prior to having mental existence - having no rights?","abortion-euthanization","02:15 PM","abortion-debates","90"
