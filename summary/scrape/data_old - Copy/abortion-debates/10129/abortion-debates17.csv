So you have to accord my idea some significant merit.","Archangel","276505","Wrong again you so called chemist. Since about 9.7 of every 10 so called zygotes that have ever existed and were left to grow to term became babies which grew into people exactly like you, which gives you first hand evidence of the potential and capabilities of each and every one in existence, then only a complete and total XXXXX who is in complete and total DENIAL of REALITY would insist that a ZYGOTE is in fact not a person. Is that what you're admitting to finally chemist ? Because imho, it's about time.","abortion-euthanization","03:47 PM","abortion-debates","249"

And I am not interested in ""potential"" since a rock is ""potentially"" a human being given sufficiently odd circumstances. Oh yes your claim that a zygote is a person is no more provable than mine that a zygote is not a person. My claim is thus at least as equally valid as your own. I cannot prove my claim, you cannot prove yours. Thus both are of approximately equal merit and decisons regarding same must be made by individuals rather than enforced by a collective institution like the Law.","abortion-euthanization","03:56 PM","abortion-debates","250"
"08-06-2007","10129",17,"Steeeeve","276258","You actually weren't bringing up any question. I disagree that consciousness has anything to do with being a human being because that is not what it means to be human being. Human DNA is pretty much the only requirement if you want to get scientific about it.","Sigma","276646","Certainly I was, which you answered below. I believe most would disagree with you that there is no quantatative and qualitative difference between a fully functional person and a brain dead vegetable living only through life-support, though both would have human DNA.

"08-06-2007","10129",17,"Another opinion","276498","Then how do YOU determine what natural rights are. If they are based on religious assumptions, then someone of another religioius belief could just as easily say that your idea of natural rights is incorrect. Indeed, the slaveholders thought that their view of blacks as inferior and justified as being slaves was supported by Christian doctrine. There are apparently many passages in the Bible (mainly the Old Testament) that talk about slavery as a normal occurrence. If there is no basis behind what one determines to be natural rights, then your view is just as arbitrarily chosen as that of the slaveholders. My view is different than the first one (natural rights) because most people's system of judgement is not either purely value judgement or purely reason. We are creatures of BOTH reason and emotion. Most of the attrocities I can think of in human history (apart from the occasional attrocities of people who felt no need to justify themselves) were due to reasons that could have been debated away. The slaveholders held their views about the inferiority of blacks not because of the skin color itself (it would have been hard to justify that rationaly) but because they felt that races with darker skin were inherently inferior. This would have been much harder to prove were they ever to be held accountable to that. It was a wrong understanding of reality that could have been cleared up with rational debate. The same is true about discrimination against women. The treatment was largely based on wrong assumptions that could have been eliminated in rational debate. Hitler blamed all Jews for actions that only a small minority was guilty of. Most wars that are fought are filled with propaganda which villifies the enemy and makes him seem sub-human. Most or all of this wrong thinking could have been eliminated with rational debate (assuming that the debate actually would have stayed rational and people would have held themselves accountable to it). Yes, often the debate might ultimately come down to value judgements, but meanwhile, one has eliminated all the bogus reasoning that has so often led to injustice. Your method (i.e. jumping to assumptions about what natural rights are) allows the bogus reasoning to remain and allows more injustice to happen. Lastly, a debate that uses reason that ultimately leads to a value judgment does not automatically lead to selfish conclusions. People treat others well not only for selfish reasons (treating others well so they would also be treated well) but because of empathy as well. It is the culture that inspires empathy. It doesn't matter if it is religious or secular. There are both religious and secular cultures that have inspired noble acts, just as there are both religious and secular cultures that have inspired attrocities. I get so tired of people suggesting that those who don't base their morality on religion are automatically selfish. History does not bear that out. Politics had a lot to do with it since the founders fully realized that the Southerners had no intention of holding themselves accountable to real discussions about slavery. Also, the values were incorrect because they were based on bogus reasoning - in that the Southerners thought blacks were automatically inferior and that slavery was their natural state. Again, all of that could have been eliminated with rational debate. Most people on the pro-choice side would see a right to one's own body as a natural right. Unless there is some rational way of defining natural rights, everyone can just go with their own view, which leaves us back at the starting point of might of numbers making right. I just think that rational debate is ultimately better than might of numbers as a determination of who gets rights, what kind and when.","Steeeeve","276696","And just as arbitrary as yours. The only difference is theirs was wrong and mine is not. Again you can't rationalize with something unless their is a standard of comparison. By this I mean you couldn't tell a slaveholder he is wrong in saying blacks aren't people unless you have a correct definition of what a person is. If you compared their own definition of person and how they acted then it would be very reasonable but very wrong. You want to talk about how most atrocities happen? They happen when people try to justify a difference between human and person and try to rank accordingly. Of course you think you have rational reasons now but those in the past felt they had rational reasons then too. Hindsight is 20/20 as they say. The first and second are still the same anyway as they all come down to value judgment or they come down to a circular argument. circular arguments are bogus reasoning. Stating natural rights is merely showing faith. I go beyond that. I say everyone is automatically selfish. And history has shown this to be true. I go further and state that only way to try to become less selfish is to have a morality outside your own control. They had many discussions on slavery. In fact you could just look to the Lincoln Douglas debates for an example. There were many many many debates and they would be wrong. No amount of ""rational debate"" would ever get you to a point of what is or isn't a right.","abortion-euthanization","03:08 PM","abortion-debates","254"
"08-06-2007","10129",17,"chemist99a","276650","So a sample of my blood constitutes a human being? Such a sample will contain my entire DNA sequence you realize! Or a few cheek cells are a human being for the same reason. As far as Human DNA goes - well you can put in a bottle you know and it just sits there. Do you think the samples used in the Human genome sequencing project were human beings?????? Why so?","Steeeeve","276697","Please tell me you aren't that dense. It would be embarrassing.","abortion-euthanization","03:09 PM","abortion-debates","255"
