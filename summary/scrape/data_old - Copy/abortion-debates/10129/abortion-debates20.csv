"08-20-2007","10129",20,"Another opinion","276965","What do you mean by ""inherent level of thinking""? There is lots of evidence for a hot sun. For example, one could easily show that areas that have had access to sunlight are hotter than areas that have not and the more open the access to sunlight for longer periods, the warmer the region becomes. Also, one can send a space probe into the sun to measure the temperature as it approaches it. One can also measure the spectrum from the sun, where experiment and theoretical analysis has shown that heat causes particular spectral signatures. All of this, of course, puts value on organized observation via scientific method - i.e. evidence. There are other types of evidence (ex. anecdotal) as well, but scientific evidence generally has the advantage of being repeatable and observable by anyone who wants to observe it. Faith is belief without evidence. There is a big difference between faith and scientific understanding, which is based on a lot of evidence. Do you seriously think that evidence plays no role? When I gave my reasons for claiming that, to me and most others, mental existence is important, I did not end it there. I responded to the why, how and what questions. Ultimately, the debate came down to the fact that we humans are inherently (from our evolution / biology) capable of empathy and empathy has historically been a main driving force for rights. It is what is most often appealed to, directly or indirectly, when rights are taken away. How is that circular? First you have to define what inferior is. How is one group inferior to the other and how is that relevant to rights? These types of questions are how rational debates are held. I suspect that the reason for that is that you claim to know it is right since you claim that your religion defines the absolute truth. Your religion tells you that zygotes have souls and that, therefore, they are people whereas unfertilized eggs are not. (or at least that is the difference you outlined in an earlier thread). You know that your views are based on faith, not on evidence or fully debatable reasons, so you try to claim that no other views involve debatable reasons or evidence either - a false claim. Here we were addressing the fact that southerners claimed that blacks were inherently inferior - and they didn't mean that they were equal in all ways except for skin color. So, the question arises - how were they thought inferior? Most aspects of human nature are testable - from intelligence, to physical fitness, to questions of courage, etc. I never claimed that there is an absolute criteria for rights. I claimed that for most people, empathy plays a role, since most appeals I have heard of for rights appeal either directly or indirectly to empathy and since the historic roots of people striving for rights was because they were suffering without them. Rights are desired and given by people, after all. I argued that it is an inherent capability in most of us (as claimed by psychologists). As for whether one can empathize accurately with a being with no mental existence, apart from the type of empathy that is a false attachment of personality (such as with pet rocks), the very definition of empathy requires a mental existence in the one you are empathizing with. How is all that circular? But that is why I bring up ""inherent"" inferiority. Of course, someone who was brought up as a slave would have much less knowledge and intellectual adaptness (on average) than someone who was brought up as the son of a rich man. However, if you take the socio-economic considerations into account, then the differences would have been much, much smaller.","Steeeeve","279437","I'm not sure I know a way to explain that further. It is the foundational thinking I suppose. This isn't truth though. This is simply making conclusions based upon accepted assumptions that most agree with (such as definition of hot, what observation is, that we are in fact existing...etc etc). Plays no role in what? And I kind of agree with your definition but everything would still come down to faith...at least faith in a few ideas. I'll address how it is circular. You claim you only have empathy for those with mental existence. That is fine but why do you think mental existence is important? The answer to that question (which we have done) simply gets back to empathy which creates the circular argument. It further doesn't address the question about how you give rights to something if you don't have empathy for it. If you had no empathy for a certain class of people then how do you convince them they should? Likely you would claim mental existence is important but that is simply an opinion and a matter of faith and inconsistent among species. They are inherently inferior. This is relevant to rights because of the belief that rights are granted to those who are of equal value. Not only that, I claim reasons do not have evidence that is relevant and that your claims are based on faith. They are thought to be inherently inferior. It just so happens that the only way to tell who is inferior is by the skin color and that is rather testable. While I disagree with some stuff here it is irrelevant since you seem to think there is no absolute criteria for rights. If there is no absolute criteria then I have a heard time understanding why my criteria is wrong. Perhaps there is an absolute criteria for determining if your method of evaluating rights is reasonable? I disagree and I'm not alone in this thinking. Of course with legal rights I do agree but I am under the impression we aren't talking about those. Empathy is actually something learned and is only partially inherent. Well for one we assume empathy is important for establishing rights. This is something I disagree with. It might be ok for arguing for someone to get rights but that doesn't mean it is the reason they have them to begin with. Certain animals have more mental existence than a 1 day old baby but I wouldn't have much empathy if the animal died and I wouldn't say this animal deserves rights. As for circular reasoning, this statement is not circular by itself but simply an unprovable statement. irrelevant. The reason blacks were treated so poorly for so long is that the people during the time period grew up learning things a certain way. If you start out believing blacks are inferior then it is darn near impossible to convert that thinking and to have any empathy for a black person. The only reason this changed was that some folks simply had beliefs and upbringing that would allow for empathy or realization that blacks are in fact people as well and thus deserving of rights. It only took an act of showing where ones views were inconsistent to change minds. A good example might be a kid that kills someone. Often times a kid like this will really have no concept that what he did ended a life and that this is a bad thing. Someone like this will never really be able to function in society as they cannot comprehend why they shouldn't kill someone. An odd concept I realize but since you look to psychology I took the liberty of asking my psychologist friend who gets to deal with people like this all the time (not like that provides anything convincing to you). The point to this is what if everyone became like that. Would we no longer have rights against killing? I suggest no because I find right to be inherent and natural. Because of this I can claim blacks always had rights and that the unborn has rights as well.","abortion-euthanization","10:51 AM","abortion-debates","288"

The outcome of harvesting organs and abortion are the same. The real question is; can we defend something before it comes to being? Danger here. Because there are many living organisms that would be covered under such conditions. Like sperm and eggs in general. Should we have laws that prevent women from having periods without sexual relations to try and get the egg to become what it was designed for? Prevent men from masturbation for the same reasons. Both items have probabilities of becoming children like a fetus or fertilized egg. Should we have laws that force women to be checked for fertilized eggs before the beginning of a period so that the embryo can be protected? There are fertilized eggs or embryos that are even flushed down church toilets without the host ever knowing. The embryos could become a productive human being if laws where in place to protect them. In fact Bush is protecting such things now by not allowing these embryos to used in science. The only failure under these conditions is attachment and we can easily take care of that. What about a person in kidney failure. We could attach tubes from a male host for nine months so we can repair the issue. With the man's organs supplying the filtering the person would not die. Should he have a choice to a host to such a thing? Might be tough on him but we could have laws that defend the life in the balance.","abortion-euthanization","12:02 PM","abortion-debates","290"

"08-21-2007","10129",20,"None","None","None","richbrmly","279738","Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS) This diagnostic test is usually performed between 8 and 11 weeks gestation, sometimes as late as 13 weeks. This is generally a test for people who have a high risk of genetic abnormalities. Test results are available within 7 to 14 days. Miscarriage rate from CVS is about 4%, recent studies indicate that if the CVS is done before 10 weeks gestation there is an added risk (.5% to 1.7%) of limb deformity, and about 3% CVS is associated with serious decline in amniotic fluid protection. There is a greater incidence of false positives because of the differences between the cellular genetic material of the choirionic villi and the fetus. There is a small chance that the sex they determine is wrong as well. Amniocentisis This diagnostic test is performed as early as 9 weeks and for diagnostic purposes, 18 weeks gestation. There is a risk of 1-1.5% miscarriage and 1% chance of other pregnancy complications (infection, premature labor, injury to the fetus, cord, or placenta, rupture of membranes, etc.). The tests take about 2-4 weeks to run. There is a small chance that the sex they tell you is incorrect. Ultrasound While ultrasound can be performed at any stage of pregnancy for the purpose of finding out the sex it is best done between 18 and 26 weeks. Most care providers will not give an ultrasound for the specific purpose of finding out the sex, and the American College of OB/GYNs has issued a statement against routine ultrasound exposure during pregnancy. However, most physicians do not heed this warning. Adequate studies on ultrasound safety have not been done, but we do know that ultrasound exposure can change the way the cell reproduces and moves. There have also been studies indicating that ultrasound heats up the cells. This method is the most frequent for finding out the sex of a baby, however, it is the least accurate. Accuracy depends on several factors: baby's cooperation, gestational age, technician's ability, etc. Doctors don't determine the sex of a baby. They don't do that because of the risk of miscarriage. 4 out of 100 means the doctor would be sued beyond recognition in a very short time. Its the lies and misleading #### that really blows my mind. What are you going to do when you find out nearly every doctor on the planet really wants to do good? People are NOT basically evil, that is a lie. People are basically good. It takes a religion to make a monster. Ask every killer in prison. No atheists, because they are not polluted.","abortion-euthanization","03:08 PM","abortion-debates","292"

If you want to discuss in more detail the broader implications of current abortion policy, I would be happy to do so. We can start with your suggestion that abortions are illegal after the first trimester. That suggestion, while common, is not correct. 12% of abortions in the United States occur after the first trimester of pregnancy . That's an estimated total of about 154,800 abortions in 2002. And besides that, you miss the point. The point I tried to advance is that people who are avidly pro-choice typically do not see any circumstances under which they would restrict abortions save for (in some instances) the third trimester. Thus, they would defend a woman's decision to obtain an abortion for the sole reason that she fears that the child will be one gender rather than the other. It also would be interesting to know (since you felt the need to weight in) whether you support abortions performed solely for the purpose of gender selection?","abortion-euthanization","12:20 AM","abortion-debates","296"
