Far worse than the current war. http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/c/childbirth/deaths.htm Pro-life is not pro-life, its pro-death. And every mother you see is actually a hero.","Steeeeve","281907","Can you prove that it is pro-life legislation that causes this or could it be a result that people are not acting is a responsible manner or perhaps even other factors? Why is it that the US allows for the most abortions yet our mortality rate is so high? I see no relationship but it seems you do...please explain. Also, the chances of at least one person dying during an abortion is almost 100% the way I look at so your numbers don't mean much.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","10:58 AM","abortion-debates","92"

People have reasons Steve (if not Steven)...The reasons your playing your game of calling me a lyer on...WOULD not change if abortion where outlawed. Are you catching up yet?? The reasons listed are based on what KILLED THE WOMEN.... Their choice killed them and YOU CAN NOT ASK A DEAD WOMAN why she made the NEGATIVE choice. But lets be honest Steve...Lets hold ourself to the same standards...one time and be honest. You know; you can not say their life threatening choices where NOT made because your media blitzes on fetal worth. In fact, if you can be as honest as I am for one moment, you would have to admit your Dogmatic connections to fetuses having souls and being children would have to have the effects we are seeing.

You can't ask dead people why they chose what they did steve. The reasoning and conclusions are sound. We (you and I) know that. A fetal brain doesn't even have enough brain to feel pain or anything, before 20 to 24 weeks; nothing there. Thats 5 months of gestation for those who don't want to do the math. There are faithful people out there that believe what they are told in Church. They buy into all the information a theologian sells them to the determent of their own lives. You have what is here, the woman, and you have what could possibly be, the fetus.

I know if a man loses his arm, he isn't shaking hands with someone in heaven. If your eyes die, you don't see paradise. If a Religious man truly believed there was life after death, he would believe the greater gift is death, not life. A dream requires energy, I think it takes around 300 calories to dream. Its costly get the theater we get when we go to sleep. Even with all that against a life after death, I still have hope. The hope is in a few facts; the conservation of energy, the knowledge that mater has only energy as a term and everything else is a constant, and that time more than likely is cyclic in many ways. Right now we share time, will we always do so? We don't know where mater comes from. All we know is that its based on energy which is something we can use. Logically knowing energy comes from mater, then we should consider the reverse to be true somehow as well. To make a long story just a bit shorter, I believe we are lonely beings indeed. I think in death, all you have after that is you. You have to live with yourself. That is the purest form of judgment I can imagine. A good person will treat themselves well and if your a judgmental war monger, all you'll have to battle is yourself. The sweetest thing, or the most evil thing you have ever encountered in your dreams truely came from you. So it might be exceptionally wise to guard your soul after all. You soul may be creating a world your going to have to live in. The whole universe was started from the spark of a tiny singularity. Maybe we have misled our self by the concept that the bang was big. Its easy to change the perspective of anything. Even a universe. So, I believe a dog does have a soul. And it will get everything it deserves like every other being. In an odd way I have great faith. If you tell me how something works I'll then know how God did it. I think we can find God.

What we all know, is that we must live with ourself, even now. The point really is, we are the product of chance, fantastic chance that just happened to fall in place or there is no chance anywhere. One or the other when you boil it all down. If a spark which is inert as things can get can bring about a universe with you in it. Then why can't a spark that is you, create a universe under the same conditions? The issue is perspective. Size and time are relative to the observer. Your size and awareness in time places things in perspective for you at the moment. All dimensions start from a origin. All I am saying is, ""Can't there be other centers? In other words; in a one dimensional world, everything is a straight line. On that line you are in union with things on the line. One line can never detect other lines, they would have to become aware of an added dimension to travel to it. Their Origin is different and they can never cross. Every dimension has this issue. Why not Time? we all share the same time. If all the other dimensions can have different origins why not time? We should never think in terms of limits. Oddly enough, there is room for every thought to become a world. Age has no meaning, only spirit does. Sparks become you, and we seem to have the proof as best we can tell. Theories are not religions. I'm not starting a religion, only adding that limiting the thoughts of one would be foolish. If time can take a single cell and become a man. Where are the limits? I love truth. Truth is everything. If I'm wrong about something. Ok. No need to start a war over it. What ever is right, is fine with me. But, its as Dogmatic to say, there is no God as to say there is one. Takes the same faith and Dogma. If Religion is your enemy, why become a Zealot? If we can get off one another's backs long enough. We will find the truth. All we need is time. Time seems to be a negative to all life yet here we are. And it took time to get here. You tell me, what are our limits? I have zero issues with the faithful in any case. I have issues with the leaders. They aways seem to point out the flaws in others and miss the horrors in the mirror. The truth should always be good enough. Never condemn yourself to one way of thinking when that is exactly the issue you have with others.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","09:52 AM","abortion-debates","534"
