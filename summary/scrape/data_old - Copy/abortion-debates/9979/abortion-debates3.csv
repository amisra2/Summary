"06-07-2007","9979",3,"chloe","267393","Now...what are the tenets of secular ethics again? ...I forgot. From where does secularism get this novel idea of ethics? Tenets of secular ethics Despite the width and diversity of their philosophical views, secular ethicists generally share one or more principles: Human beings, through their ability to empathise, are capable of determining ethical grounds. Human beings, through logic and reason, are capable of deriving normative principles of behaviour. This may lead to a behaviour morally preferable to that propagated or condoned based on religious texts.","thelmoose","267396","I took a quick look in Wikipedia under ""secular ethics"" and found these. I didn't even know there would be such an entry. I usually don't identify with or see the need for labels like ""secularism"" or ""humanism"" or ""christianity"" as though we have to define ourselves or our thinking in any particular way. That is why I was surprised that such an entry existed. I would have thought it was just plain ""ethics"". Anyway, though it is only wikipedia, it seems like a reasonable list of ideas to consider as a starting point of this topic. By the way, Chloe, ethics and morals are not a ""novel idea"". They have been around a long time, much longer than religion, in fact. Can you find any problem with these ideas?","god-doesnt-want-abortion","09:03 PM","abortion-debates","31"

I mean, do you think the excuse, well God, I didn't believe in you so you can't judge me, will actually work ? To deny God is Mans ultimate self delusion, and satans ultimate deception was getting people to believe both he and God is a man made persona.","ShadowPikachu","267404","Let's say it this way Archie, just because you don't believe in Odin even though He IS the Creator of all that is, do you think that will exempt you from standing before Him someday ?

When I hear claims of morality coming from a certain Holy book, I am feel I slight chill of fear in my spine when I realize that a few words in the book are the only things keeping these people in line and from becoming ravening madmen/women.

"06-08-2007","9979",3,"None","None","None","chemist99a","267571","Phyllis: There is a manifest and obvious difference between God causing a miscarriage (which may or may not be the case in the passages you quoted), and a doctor doing the same. It is as simple as this: in the first example the Creator is dealing with his creatures as he sees fit. In the second instance, one creature is dealing with another creature as the former sees fit. I have said that God is obviously free to do as he pleases. But it does not follow from that fact that you are free to do as you please. God can righteously and justly kill human beings. Human beings, on the other hand, cannot righteously nor justly murder other human beings. This ""manifest difference"" however vanishes if on e is not a believer in GOD does it not? I do not believe that there IS or WAS a creator nor do I believe that any evidence is available which points to any other conclusion. GOD to me is not only not ""free"" to do as he pleases, he simply does not exist. In most instances where human beings are purportedly killed by GOD the actual work is done in the NAME of GOD by humans who claim to be his agents and the actions they take are coercive. In addition where perfectly rational human actions like having or doing an abortion without coercion of the patient then no moral breach is created. Its only when someone is forced to have an abortion or forced NOT to have one that the moral boundary is broken.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","07:58 PM","abortion-debates","35"
"06-08-2007","9979",3,"None","None","None","chemist99a","267573","Again, it seems to me that you simply cannot stand in judgment of God. I've already shown why that is the case. I am not justifying anything. God can do as he pleases. It does not follow, however, that you may do as you please. Especially if there is nothing or nobody to stand in judgement of. But as I said previously many of the judgements of GOD are simply judgements made by men and then attributed to GOD. GOD IMHO can do nothing at all, indeed he has no will or preferences, or existense. Humans can and often do as they please (by choice) to their joy and to their woe. God is as they say not in the room.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","08:05 PM","abortion-debates","36"
"06-08-2007","9979",3,"simone","267341","You speak as though you were God Almighty yourself. How is it that you came to speak in this manner?","chemist99a","267574","My point is confirmed by observation. AA knows what GOD wants and is willing to act as if he is the instrument of same. But its all a means of having your way by asserting a non-existent higher authority. Much like the old story of the inspector general.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","08:08 PM","abortion-debates","37"

GOD does not exist, there is nothing there to judge any of us. Its a no-brainer. And in fact to assert GOD is mans ultimate con game operated against his fellow man. The whole thing is just an extension of patriarchal social organizations to the extent that the universe itself operates in the same way as a tribal society.

Are you to emulate the entity who gifted man with death, who drowned most of the human species, who condoned the destruction of S&G, who had populations put to the sword, who condoned slavery, who let Hitler loose upon the world, who invented Malaria, Plague, Cancer, and occassionaly (jokingly) asked humans to sacrifice their children? Sorry but those are not ethics which I could ethically adopt. Oh yes I forgot the threats to make me burn in Hell if I do not worship him and his after all that death and destruction.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","08:20 PM","abortion-debates","40"

Once one removes God, he has removed the only authoritative standard by which actions can be deemed as right or wrong. We are left with personal preferences, which certainly do not amount to moral truths.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","08:21 PM","abortion-debates","41"

"06-08-2007","9979",3,"Archangel","267182","As usual, in addition to lying and blaspheming about God, SP must pull verses out of context and then unfairly attribute there brutality to God. Here's the complete passage of 2 Kings 15:16 that he refers to. Note the bolded verse. 2Ki 15:15 Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and the conspiracy which he led, indeed they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 2Ki 15:16 Then from Tirzah, Menahem attacked Tiphsah, all who were there, and its territory. Because they did not surrender, therefore he attacked it. All the women there who were with child he ripped open. 2Ki 15:17 In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem the son of Gadi became king over Israel, and reigned ten years in Samaria. 2Ki 15:18 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin. So typically, the part SP neglected to share in his account is that God didn't order or condone of the acts of Menahem, for he did evil in the sight of the Lord.","JPSartre12","267588","You will find a decided lack of honesty when dealing with particular people in this forum, AA.

Taking a biblical quote out of context is a favorite tactic of many atheists. This one certainly seems to be out of context, as reading a mere 2 verses farther yields the statement that ""[Menahem] did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. Guess I didn't read the following verses (mainly because they are under another heading) - I just looked for places with ""ripped up"" after I saw it in the previous part - my bad on this one, but the others still stand.","Phyllis","267592","I do wish to weigh in here.
