"06-08-2007","9979",4,"Phyllis","267592","I do wish to weigh in here. To be fair, I pointed out this mistake to Shadow in post #7 . I said: In the following post , Shadow acknowledged the mistake, which I certainly do not think was made in bad faith. He said: Let's not try and make something out of nothing. When somebody makes a mistake and then corrects it, let's not accuse them of acting maliciously or in bad faith.","Archangel","267614","Hi Phyllis, I appreciate your correction, and admit I was unaware of the earlier correction by you and SPs acknowledgment of it. So I went back and checked out the Hosea passage in context and notice that he did it again. Chapters 8 and 9 are Gods judgement on Israel for their lack of faithfulness and Idolatry as the people of God.Here is what SP posted. Hsa 9:11 As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird-- No birth, no pregnancy, and no conception! Hsa 9:12 Though they bring up their children, Yet I will bereave them to the last man. Yes, woe to them when I depart from them! Hsa 9:13 Just as I saw Ephraim like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place, So Ephraim will bring out his children to the murderer."" Hsa 9:14 Give them, O LORD-- What will You give? Give them a miscarrying womb And dry breasts! Hsa 9:15 ""All their wickedness is in Gilgal, For there I hated them. Because of the evil of their deeds I will drive them from My house; I will love them no more. All their princes are rebellious. Hsa 9:16 Ephraim is stricken, Their root is dried up; They shall bear no fruit. Yes, were they to bear children, I would kill the darlings of their womb."" Hsa 9:17 My God will cast them away, Because they did not obey Him; And they shall be wanderers among the nations. Note the prophecy regarding the loss of their homeland in the bolded. Now here in Chapter 11 we see the Lords Fatherly Love, or as Paul Harvey would say, the rest of the story. Hsa 11:1 ""WHEN Israe was a child, I loved him, And out of Egypt I called My son. Hsa 11:2 As they called them,[fn1] So they went from them;[fn2] They sacrificed to the Baals, And burned incense to carved images. Hsa 11:3 ""I taught Ephraim to walk, Taking them by their arms;[fn3] But they did not know that I healed them. Hsa 11:4 I drew them with gentle cords,[fn4] With bands of love, And I was to them as those who take the yoke from their neck.[fn5] I stooped and fed them. Hsa 11:5 ""He shall not return to the land of Egypt; But the Assyrian shall be his king, Because they refused to repent. Hsa 11:6 And the sword shall slash in his cities, Devour his districts, And consume them, Because of their own counsels. Hsa 11:7 My people are bent on backsliding from Me. Though they call to the Most High,[fn6] None at all exalt Him. Hsa 11:8 ""How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I set you like Zeboiim? My heart churns within Me; My sympathy is stirred. Hsa 11:9 I will not execute the fierceness of My anger; I will not again destroy Ephraim. For I am God, and not man, The Holy One in your midst; And I will not come with terror.[fn7] Hsa 11:10 ""They shall walk after the LORD. He will roar like a lion. When He roars, Then His sons shall come trembling from the west; Hsa 11:11 They shall come trembling like a bird from Egypt, Like a dove from the land of Assyria. And I will let them dwell in their houses,"" Says the LORD. Hsa 11:12 ""Ephraim has encircled Me with lies, And the house of Israel with deceit; But Judah still walks with God, Even with the Holy One[fn8] who is faithful. So you see Phyllis, SP is solid evidence that if one picks and chooses out of context, they can make the bible appear to say anything they want to. But God is not pro-abortion and neither does He condone murdering babies. But you would never get that from what SP posts. And what is most amazing is that this guy actually has the audacity to call himself a christian as if the label carries some weight with the living God.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","10:53 PM","abortion-debates","46"

In fact, it isn't even the only example this week.","ShadowPikachu","267617","Actually, if you take out your mighty Bible, JP, you will clearly see that the two verses in question are under a different heading - the ripping up is under the heading of ""Shallum king of Israel"", and the verses that you are accusing me of ""subterfuge"" (pot kettle black) are under the heading ""Menaneah King of Israel"" No subterfuge involved (and I'd like to see these many instances - including the one this week, rather than just hearing you spout ad homs at me ). Thanks, by the way, Phyllis - despite our disagreements you have proven yourself honest by pointing this out, and that definitely gives you points in my book. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Spelling and grammar for this post has been checked and cleared +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++","god-doesnt-want-abortion","11:04 PM","abortion-debates","48"

We are already aware from the verses I posted that this was a ""judgment"" or whatever pretty name you want to label it. The fact remains that he killed these foetuses that you so love, caused miscarriages, etc. This in ""judgment"" - aren't you the one who is always talking about the ""innocent baby"" when a woman who was raped is going to abort, talking about how we can't ""punish"" it for the evil rapist? And yet here we see that your God is killing all of these ""innocent foetuses/babies"" for something someone else did, and boy then it's all fine and dandy! +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Spelling and grammar for this post has been checked and cleared +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++","god-doesnt-want-abortion","11:15 PM","abortion-debates","49"

Why do you think anyone who is following their natural and normal inclinations requires defense. Or to put it another way why would you be attacking fellow human beings whose actions and personal lives and life styles do not in any way harm you or even impact your life? Basically you should keep your nose out of other peoples sex lives - you have absolutely no right to insert it where it does not belong. Unless of course you wish others to return the favor. OK maybe you do advocate sex inspectors and such - but thats invasive, coercive, and violative of human rights. I guess what I am trying to say is that your attitude is uncivilized and actually disgusting.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","10:50 AM","abortion-debates","57"

"06-09-2007","9979",4,"None","None","None","chemist99a","267699","JP in reply to LES said: If there was no stigma attached to homosexuality, it's possible that we could all be on the verge of extinction by now. As it is, the limited scope of homosexuality in the US has prevented an AIDS epidemic here. Had a much greater number of Americans been engaging in unsafe homosexual sex acts, then we could be presiding over the death of a nation right now. So you believe that if there were no stigma attached to homosexuality that there would be more homosexuals? Do you really believe that the proportion of homosexuals in the US is controlled by social stigma? Do you think absent that stigma many more males would be homosexual? What do you think the percentage would rise to - 30%, 70% ? In general I do not think stigma has much to do with biological traits. In addition its entirely possible that the stigma attached to homosexuality ended up making the epidemic in the US worse in two ways. First the US public health resources were kept out of the fray early on by that stigma. Secondly homosexuals would not openly discuss their relationships with doctors etc because of that stigma. It may be that the stigma allowed the disease to penetrate deeper into the population than it would have otherwise.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","11:13 AM","abortion-debates","59"
