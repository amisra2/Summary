"06-06-2007","9979",2,"Phyllis","267177","I have said that I do not agree with you that the quotes you provided deal with abortion. But, I have assumed it for the sake of argument. With that caveat in place...I don't have a problem with God killing people that he made. It goes beyond the text to assume that there were. answered above. OK. This is not semantics. God, because he is God, can lay down rules for his creatures to follow. And God, because he is God, can punish his creatures for not obeying those rules. This is not semantics. It simply is not possible for God to commit murder. God is subject to no law, and therefore cannot kill a person in violation of any law. And it is a gross misunderstanding to suggest that God kills innocent people. There are no innocent people according to Scripture (which appears to be the standard established in this thread). And I don't worship fetuses, as doing so would be idolatry. No, that was not an argument. It was an illustration of a point. The point was this: that in order to stand in moral judgment of God, you would have to be of higher moral character than God. In other words, you would have to be God in order to judge God. Now, the point I made is that this is highly unlikely, as any being claiming to be God would not misspell words, no matter how closely the letters are on the keyboard. To be clear, I was not attacking you (at least I didn't intend to) by calling out your spelling mistake. I was trying to illustrate a point. And the point was this: you are not perfect, and therefore, you are not God. And if you are not God, then you really cannot stand in moral judgment of God. I think you have missed the point. The verses you cited all describe the actions as a judgment. That is to say, it is a punishment. Punishments carry with them a negative connotation. The Jews would not have understood those verses to be positive. In other words, the abortions (as you call them) were a bad thing to and not a good thing. They were a negative and not a positive.","ShadowPikachu","267198","So bereaving them when they conceive children and causing their wombs to miscarry - no that wouldn't be abortion, now would it? Guess anyone can just do chemical abortion or take herbal medicines to cause abortion and you would not be able to call that abortion. Actually you have answered nothing. And yes, it goes beyond ""the text"", but are you rational enough to realize that when women have sex with men, they might get pregnant, and that among a large group as referenced, it is ludicrous to say that there were not pregnant women? If you do not have that rationality or at least the credibility to say so, we have nothing further to discuss - you just can't convince religious extremists (Christian OR Muslim) As I said, semantics (just as when your ilk claims abortion is murder and when we say no, it really is not and then you guys bitch and moan about us getting into semantics) Actually, foetuses, which your ilk claims are living humans, have done nothing that can possibly be sinful. And you might not worship them, but it sure looks like it to everyone else. Yes, I said that it wasn't an argument - it was an attack on my person, on my misspelling a word. And no, I am not God, and neither are you, and neither were the writers of the Bible (which, only through Circular Logic is Gods Word) And yet, you and your ilk are the first to moan about not killing a foetus that is the result of a rape/incest case now, since it is God doing it, the poor little foetuses (in the women who are being punished) dont matter. You worship a pretty sick god, Phyllis. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Spelling and grammar for this post has been checked and cleared +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++","god-doesnt-want-abortion","08:28 PM","abortion-debates","16"
"06-06-2007","9979",2,"Phyllis","267231","There is a manifest and obvious difference between God causing a miscarriage (which may or may not be the case in the passages you quoted), and a doctor doing the same. It is as simple as this: in the first example the Creator is dealing with his creatures as he sees fit. In the second instance, one creature is dealing with another creature as the former sees fit. I have said that God is obviously free to do as he pleases. But it does not follow from that fact that you are free to do as you please. God can righteously and justly kill human beings. Human beings, on the other hand, cannot righteously nor justly murder other human beings. On the one hand you admit that your conclusion relies on an assumption that rests completely outside of the text. And then you fault me for not being ""rational"" enough to realize the obvious fact that there were pregnant women among the group. Now that is most inconsistent. The reality is that if the Bible is to be taken literally in this instance, then it ought to be taken literally in other instances as well. And when it is taken literally in other instances, we find that God is quite a miraculous God. He very well could have ensured that no one was pregnant at the time. It just goes beyond the text, and to form a conclusion based upon a biased assumption is, well, biased. I say, and maintain, that this passage does not speak to abortion at all, and to say that it does, to quote you, ""goes beyond the 'text.'"" It goes beyond the facts that are given. I doubt you know very much about me or my ilk. I am not playing semantics, though I will always maintain that words have meaning. And in this case the being we call ""God"" simply cannot murder because of the nature of God and the nature of murder are wholly inconsistent. There you go talking about my ilk again. More conclusions that are not based in fact. But I will say this: you seem to have an interesting view of what it is to worship something. You can continue to distort if you want. But that doesn't make the distortion correct. There you go again talking about things of which you cannot possibly know. I mean seriously, do you really think you know anything about me? What are you even talking about here? The pro-life position is simply that only the Creator of life has the authority end life. If you buy a boat, and proceed to destroy it with a sledgehammer, no one has a claim against you. But if you buy a boat, and I destroy it with a sledgehammer, then you have a claim against me. It's a principle of ownership. The creatures belong the the Creator. There you go again. Is this the fourth time now?","ShadowPikachu","267233","Yep, lovely god you worship - free license to either commit or ""order"" abortions (as he did to Moses in one passage I quoted) and genocide (when your ilk is supposedly against abortion and such). You can try to justify it all you like - it is unjustifiable if you are against abortion. And, as I said this before, I will now say it again as you remain irrational: If you do not have that rationality or at least the credibility to say so, we have nothing further to discuss - you just can't convince religious extremists (Christian OR Muslim) This will be my last post to you unless you have the integrity to agree that some of the women (of a whole people) would have been pregnant. So go worship your twisted little god, and leave Christianity to normal Christians.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","11:09 PM","abortion-debates","19"
"06-07-2007","9979",2,"Archangel","267182","As usual, in addition to lying and blaspheming about God, SP must pull verses out of context and then unfairly attribute there brutality to God. Here's the complete passage of 2 Kings 15:16 that he refers to. Note the bolded verse. 2Ki 15:15 Now the rest of the acts of Shallum, and the conspiracy which he led, indeed they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 2Ki 15:16 Then from Tirzah, Menahem attacked Tiphsah, all who were there, and its territory. Because they did not surrender, therefore he attacked it. All the women there who were with child he ripped open. 2Ki 15:17 In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem the son of Gadi became king over Israel, and reigned ten years in Samaria. 2Ki 15:18 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD; he did not depart all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had made Israel sin. So typically, the part SP neglected to share in his account is that God didn't order or condone of the acts of Menahem, for he did evil in the sight of the Lord.","simone","267341","You speak as though you were God Almighty yourself.

To believe that I was exempt would mean that I believe there is a god, i just do not choose to follow god. However, since I don't believe in god in the first place, there is nothing to be exempted from. Again, not applicable to someone who does not believe in god.

Would anyone even care? The United States is supposed to be the land of the ""FREE."" Meaning, people need to stop trying to shove their beliefs on other people. If anyone wants to believe in God, or Santa, or the Keebler Elves, then they have the right to. What no one has the right to do is legislate their own interpretation of morality strictly based on outdated religious edicts. Morality is subjective. What one person finds ""offensive"" is not necessarily ""offensive"" to others, so who is to say that it is ""offensive?"" This is one of the main reasons for the separation of church and state in the US. It was established not only to create unmanageable conflict among the lower class, but also to prevent the Pope or some other mutt to dictate our laws from 3,000 miles away. The laws of this nation are supposed to be dictated only by the voters, based on popular experience and sound judgement.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","08:33 PM","abortion-debates","27"
