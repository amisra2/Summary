"09-03-2007","9979",12,"Steeeeve","282057","I see you are trying to change the debate after you realize you have no backing for what you claimed. Again, please show me a correlation between pro-life legislation and increase in mortality rates in pregnancy. You already failed to show the 10,000 deaths a year number and you changed the debate on that one too. It is becoming clearer and clearer that you aren't here to debate or offer reasonable discussion as Another Opinion and I believe we should have here but you just want to offer a close-minded view with bogus facts. If this how you want to continue posting then so be it but count me out and I'll just add you to the ignore list now. You can join Jitobear and Chemist on that list","richbrmly","282061","What pro-life legislation? The partalbirth abortion ban?? that? I will show the data next year, it was just passed. Interesting fact Steve...Of all the abortions that would cover, only 10...Just 10 abortions where on a fetus that would have been born and not need life support. No medical text book on the earth has a Paralbirh abortion proceedure. NONE. You could say wow, you get to save ten lifes at the cost it took. but hay, if you where the doctor involved, I wonder how it would have turned out.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","05:44 PM","abortion-debates","166"

You said ""Under the current Pro-life campaign the deaths of women during child birth has increased by one death per day."" My question was addressing whether or not you could show a correlation between increased morality rate during child birth and the supposed ""pro-life campaign"" (which I assume means legislation but this doesn't really matter). When answering this question you should keep in mind the 4 reasons given for the increase had nothing to do with anything regarding pro-life positions. I also believe you have indirectly answered my question about whether or not you will be honest in debate.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","08:37 PM","abortion-debates","167"

"09-03-2007","9979",12,"None","None","None","richbrmly","282100","One thing I forgot to mention regarding the quoting of Jesus. Jesus was wrong. Just to set the record straight. Money (or the love of) is not the root of all evil. He was wrong. Women get raped every day of the week and most never get their wallet touched. People get beaten and hurt never losing a dime. The Root of all Evil...its root......Is power. Wanting power over something. That is the root. Money can give you power if you use it that way. Now, Jesus may not have been able to convey that, because his ministry could have been cut pretty short. But, there it is.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","10:05 PM","abortion-debates","169"

"09-04-2007","9979",12,"Steeeeve","281907","Can you prove that it is pro-life legislation that causes this or could it be a result that people are not acting is a responsible manner or perhaps even other factors? Why is it that the US allows for the most abortions yet our mortality rate is so high? I see no relationship but it seems you do...please explain. Also, the chances of at least one person dying during an abortion is almost 100% the way I look at so your numbers don't mean much.","Winston Smith","282165","define 'person'","god-doesnt-want-abortion","09:00 AM","abortion-debates","171"
"09-04-2007","9979",12,"None","None","None","richbrmly","282169","Law does not make morality. If it did, Jesus would have been a bartender in Israel. #1: Our mortality rate isn't all that high. Higher than Europe true, but they have health care and they clearly allow abortion to safe life. #2: We allow abortion and yet there are women that choose to carry to term. 1.3 million women where hurt during the birthing process last year. This number is larger than the number of abortions last year. Just because we allow choice doesn't mean we are going to force abortion. Its called choice. Even if a woman has a high chance of losing her life, choice is given. Your sick bunch wants to remove choice and demand that the state determines who is given Choice. You want to say a fetus is a baby. But, the state will allow the death of a baby if it will save the woman. Thats how sick you guys are. BECAUSE...if your saying a woman can use her baby to save herself, then your saying she can throw her baby to a pack of wolfs or a bear so she'll have time to escape...Same thing if the fetus is a baby, OR your admitting the fetus is not a baby. one or the other. If the fetus ever becomes a baby in the eyes of the state, then the state can never decide who will be able to live. It can't make that kind of decision and you more than likely know that. The Bible makes it very clear.. With out any doubt that the fetus is NOT a baby. Oh true. The bible makes that fact quite clear. If you cause an abortion on a woman and no other damage is done, you are fined if the husband requires it. Thats right out the flaming bush book in the bible. Where God talked to Moses. I have even said, I'll join your side if you can join my side on getting women impregnated medical care and the option to abort if their life is at risk..No no...Shouldn't cost you money if a woman is raped. Maybe your asking; why can't we become another Afghanistan and throw women in jail for being raped? We control that country as well. Well, its not going to happen.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","09:50 AM","abortion-debates","172"

Lets play a game and add all the abortions that would happen if we forced abortion in the case of rape or danger to the woman. 1.3 million women hurt in the gestation process plus 95, 000 is beyond the number of abortions last year...BEYOND IT. You people somehow believe people are inherently bad. They are not. People are good, unless their spirits are captured by freaks like you. Choice is good. Pro-life is pro-death. all it is.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","10:18 AM","abortion-debates","173"

Very healthy, happy families. If you really wanted to limit abortion as a pro-choice person does, you'd put your money where you mouth is. Health care directly prevents these issues. Old women can be given birth control with the young. Abortion would drop more than your want for law. Lets play honest, your worship of money far exceeds your issues with abortion. pro-choice wants to save life. Its what it does.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","04:51 AM","abortion-debates","175"

People will have to wait 6 months and use the Moses abortion solution. Beat them til they abort. Aborting is easy. Easy as making a pie. Women actually have to take care of themselves. If you look at population and ratios to abortion. Its higher in Israel. Mexico...where its been illegal winston...Out lawed. The only thing you going to do when you take a way choice...Is kill.
