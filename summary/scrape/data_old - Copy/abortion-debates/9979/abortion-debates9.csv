What is the worth of reincarnation if you lose your memories? The Christian hope is the salvation of the soul. It is real and detectable, we have advanced a great deal on our knowledge of the mind. At any point your memories die, you die and body lives on. We have seen this in nature as well. People have lost their memories and become someone else with independent likes and dislikes. The only connection to the past is the similarity in appearance.","chemist99a","281417","And just where is this supposed explanation? Lots of reference s to soul in the bible. I did not find any explanation of what it might be though! And I don't see how it can be part of the body given that its supposed to be immortal. And what feels emotion etc is basically lower brain functions and hormones!","god-doesnt-want-abortion","12:47 PM","abortion-debates","121"

Clearly he is talking about his mind. I think he's easy to understand, mostly because he didn't a PhD in Philosophy","god-doesnt-want-abortion","04:26 PM","abortion-debates","122"
"08-29-2007","9979",9,"richbrmly","281390","We have never seen the soul like we have never seen thought. we can see the energy trails thought as it operates. Drugs can alter the mind and soul. People can be made angry, afraid, happy, and so depressed they can hardly breath. By chemicals. The soul is fleeting just as the bible describes. Some People believe the soul lives on. Houdini desperately wanted to believe this and memorized a word for his wife. Takes thought for such an event. People look for ghosts that have some connections to a place because of the events in their past. The memories they hold. We have a soul, anytime we can think. If we can not think, we have no soul. Christianity calls death sleeping. They have pushed the hope past the soul and added the body. The body is dead, but they believe it will live yet again.","Winston Smith","281478","Animals also think and apes and another primates can also reason, they also have feelings and experience pain and joy just like us. So if the capacity to reason according to you comes from the soul it follows they also possess a soul, right?","god-doesnt-want-abortion","09:20 PM","abortion-debates","123"

Many animals can only respond to the moment. A cow forgets the capture of its young in minutes. Many of the grazing animals are very limited in spirit. A fish has little emotional baggage. Some animals though; I would agree, have a soul and it can be troubled. Elephants even visit graves. Water Buffalo remember attack strategies of their enemies and counter them; clearly for the benefit of the herd. Any animal that feel for another and remember has the chain of a soul. A soul can provide pain without fiscal damage. The pain from a soul can incapacitate an animal as completely as a bullet into the brain. A Dog can be shaped by the memories an owner provides it. A Dog can be a very friendly or a monster. All souls can be shaped by outside forces and this is the chief reason why man must care for more than himself. In the end, it all affects him. Like the Dog that has become a monster.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","10:42 PM","abortion-debates","124"
"08-30-2007","9979",9,"richbrmly","281399","No, I can put a brain in your hands and you find no soul or thoughts in it.","snakespit","281527","This would perhaps be true with many of our more interesting posters. The concept of a ""soul"" is an abstract one, with no tangible evidence or concrete definition. I was merely trying to point out that the part of a human that is responsible for thought, emotion, reasoning, and memory is the brain, not a soul.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","09:14 AM","abortion-debates","125"

We can extend the memory by addressing it and restoring it. If I disrupt the synapses with electromechanical means or chemical means the memory is lost and I distorted the individual. I changed him, yet no physical damage occurred (I have heard of a scientific group that said they can indeed erase memory). The real question is: Did I kill him? My answer is: If I erase his mind I did kill him. The person left behind is completely different than the one before the alteration of energy in the mind. The mind is like a computer without a hard drive. The energy running the synapses can never be removed without the loss of everything that makes the man who he is. Some brains can have different independent loops running in it, each operating off the same memories yet having different personalities. This can happen under long periods of stress or failures in development. Currently, we believe this to be incurable for now and we use drugs to suppress the issue. Many fascinating questions will come up when we are able to stun the other loops and basically kill them. Should we be selective? Determine good and bad souls and such?","god-doesnt-want-abortion","11:51 AM","abortion-debates","126"

But isn't it still silly to argue about what a hypothetical (unprovable, unfalsifiable) GOD would or would not wish or do? Especially considering that such a being could do anything at all - ANYTHING given the omni-potent, and omniscient assumptions on its nature? Best to check the premises before arguing about angels! And even if GOD did not want abortions today who could possibly say that it would not want them tomorrow on a whim? Noboy at least no humans!","god-doesnt-want-abortion","08:58 PM","abortion-debates","130"
"08-30-2007","9979",9,"Winston Smith","281618","so dogs go to heaven?","richbrmly","281642","I only know what I know. I know if a man loses his arm, he isn't shaking hands with someone in heaven. If your eyes die, you don't see paradise. If a Religious man truly believed there was life after death, he would believe the greater gift is death, not life. A dream requires energy, I think it takes around 300 calories to dream. Its costly get the theater we get when we go to sleep. Even with all that against a life after death, I still have hope. The hope is in a few facts; the conservation of energy, the knowledge that mater has only energy as a term and everything else is a constant, and that time more than likely is cyclic in many ways. Right now we share time, will we always do so? We don't know where mater comes from. All we know is that its based on energy which is something we can use. Logically knowing energy comes from mater, then we should consider the reverse to be true somehow as well. To make a long story just a bit shorter, I believe we are lonely beings indeed. I think in death, all you have after that is you. You have to live with yourself. That is the purest form of judgment I can imagine. A good person will treat themselves well and if your a judgmental war monger, all you'll have to battle is yourself. The sweetest thing, or the most evil thing you have ever encountered in your dreams truely came from you. So it might be exceptionally wise to guard your soul after all. You soul may be creating a world your going to have to live in. The whole universe was started from the spark of a tiny singularity. Maybe we have misled our self by the concept that the bang was big. Its easy to change the perspective of anything. Even a universe. So, I believe a dog does have a soul. And it will get everything it deserves like every other being. In an odd way I have great faith. If you tell me how something works I'll then know how God did it. I think we can find God. Judging from who are, I think he wants to be found.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","09:55 PM","abortion-debates","131"
"08-30-2007","9979",9,"chemist99a","281643","Well I think that you are dead and thats it. You don't have to live with yourself in fact you cannot being that you are dead! There is a one word rebuttal to that -------- ENTROPY. You are not constrained by logic, reason, or observation with regard to personal belief so I have to accept that in spite of the evidence you do believe what you say you believe. However I believe that the fate of that dog and the fate of each human being is the same. We live, we die and after death we become disorganized non-living matter. In other words we achieve obliviion - which is considered desirable in many eastern religions, reincarnation is a punishment and so would eteral life be. Maybe we deserve either heaven or hell, but all we are likely to get is oblivion - which some consider to be a good thing.","richbrmly","281649","We may not be so far apart as it appears. You and I believe man came from a lower form of animal. We all started out as some single cell thing. I would guess you believe we came from the big bang if you subscribe to that. So, if the concept can be accepted with no consciences over all mater; Is it really such a jump in the imagination to consider there is one? I am very interested in what we discover in DNA. 80% of our DNA does nothing really. Wouldn't it be a blast to discover someone actually wrote a book after all? As far as a fetus, when it dreams its a living soul. I think the mother's life is the greatest consideration naturally. 4 women die every day in child birth, just in the United States. Last year over 4 million births happened and 1.3 million women where hurt during the process. They where given choice and chose to carry to term. 1.2 million women chose not to carry to term. If the choice is removed the deaths and injuries will clearly go up. Seems choice is the best option in my mind. When all is said and done; A fetus is a parasitic animal that requires a cooperative host. The host has to cooperate for a viable child to come into being. The path to the fetus is so simple to follow a child could do an abortion. Only a thin membrane protects the fetus. In Mexico there where nearly a million abortions when it was illegal. 800,000 hospitalized women with 8000 deaths. If you see a baby, you see the evidence that a mother cared enough to take care of herself and carry it to term. We all deserve to know that much from our mothers at least. We can't strap people down and force them to host something they want to forgo. Choice makes sense. I can't recommend to anyone, what to do under what conditions so I have to be pro-choice.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","11:35 PM","abortion-debates","133"

But I think it should be legal, as safe as we can make it, and by personal choice.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","03:18 AM","abortion-debates","134"

So if you died senile you remain in heaven senile and feeble? If you are right, it would be ideal to die young and healthy how do you know all this? I hope you are right for the sake of the dogs though.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","08:39 AM","abortion-debates","135"
