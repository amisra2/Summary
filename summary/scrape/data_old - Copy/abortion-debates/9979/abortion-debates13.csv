Stating so, I believe that abortion should be illegal in all general cases including rape. This is because that even what this will-be child's father did a terrible thing to the mother, the child has not done anything wrong. It is still a child of God and deserves to be loved as much as the mother woul in normal conditions. That's my opinion and I'm stiking to it.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","08:56 PM","abortion-debates","181"

In mine it would not make it past the first week - not from a rape it would not. My family is not into being extorted or serving as an incubator for rapists.

Right now in labs all over the country, what you call human is in freezers waiting to be flushed, or used in research, or given to a person that can gestate them. Lets say your right tdocher. Your believes should call you into action today tdkocher, your female family members can save these lives right now. All they have to do is gestate them. Let the embros gestate in their bodies and go to term. By your own moral code, if you don't, your allowing their deaths because its very clear your females can save them today. Don't you dare ask them or give them a choice tdocher, you force them by your moral law. Prove to me and the world they are living humans tdocher. You can do that very simply by saving what you can. You can save a boat load of them by simply using all your females over and over again. If you don't do this your a lier or the lifes of these embros has no meaning to any of your females. I am very interested in how many you save. Let us know.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","07:39 AM","abortion-debates","188"

All that happens is that a fertilized egg which was fertilized against the will of the eggs owner, is stopped in its progress towards becoming a human being. There is no human being there other than the victim of the rape.","JPSartre12","284299","Do you know exactly when human life begins?
