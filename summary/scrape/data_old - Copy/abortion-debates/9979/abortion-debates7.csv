If your a scientist you'll know he is your brother because of the massive similarities you have with him and the identical ancestors your share. Also the basic fact is that if your life experiences where to match his, you'd nearly be identical to him philosophically. After all; what is the difference between a Palestinian and a Jew? The answer is nothing.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","09:55 AM","abortion-debates","92"

"08-07-2007","9979",7,"None","None","None","richbrmly","276859","Sadly that is true. There is even a story in the bible of a woman pleading with Jesus to heal her daughter. Jesus stated; ""It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs."" Jesus basically called her and sick daughter, Dogs. And she said, ""Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table."" Here she makes a basic claim that even if her and her daughter be unworthy of aid, that a dog would be treated better than the current approach being offered. Jesus healed the woman's daughter. Now, was Jesus right? Was the woman and her Daughter no better than Dogs? No; this was an error. He was speaking to his sister, though in the end the right option was used.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","10:39 AM","abortion-debates","94"

But, even dogs can be shown mercy and used as an example for the 'True Man'. Thus the examples made of the Good Samaritans and woman at the well.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","11:59 AM","abortion-debates","95"
"08-07-2007","9979",7,"None","None","None","richbrmly","276890","If Christ is speaking in the literal term, the statement would be clearly flawed because the relationship between the woman and a dog is nearly zero. Women speak, Dogs do not. Women stand on two legs, Dogs do not. If Christ where speaking in a philosophical term, the state statement becomes even more flawed, in fact the reverse would hold more water. A dog is a packing animal; the woman was clearly at Jesus side when requesting what she did, outside her pack. It was Jesus who was within his pack and acting like a dog would by attacking an outsider of the pack. The statement can not be supported by any means of reasoning.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","12:44 PM","abortion-debates","96"

Because otherwise, you're realise that there is a simple comparison being made.

"08-10-2007","9979",7,"None","None","None","Winston Smith","277523","Since I never call any woman bitch your question is not applicable to me. On the other hand I also never call a female dog bitch. I have a female German Shepherd which sleeps at the feet of my bed and I call her my princess for she is a beautiful princess to me. She is beautiful. Period. To me she is not an it but a she. I am not an etymologist so I dont know if female dogs were first called bitches and later some females of our species, or the other way around. Yes, I love dogs profoundly but not only dogs.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","10:17 AM","abortion-debates","103"
"08-20-2007","9979",7,"None","None","None","richbrmly","279418","A woman is born with over 1/2 million eggs in their reproductive system. 1/2 million of something that singularly has the potential of taking their life. A woman can become impregnated at nearly a yearly rate. Breast feeding does not slow this process. Any female that gets a disease that harms her immune system or requires a treatment that stuns said system has a high potential of losing her life if a fetus is gestating in her. How many women while pregnant discover they have cancer? Age is a factor in a woman being able to carry a fetus to term. 15 years and younger have physical issues that can do harm to them. Women over 50 or in Menopause can actually become pregnant and their bodies would have a tuff time carrying to term. Abortions happen in Mexico, where it is all but outlawed. The Mexican legislators who voted to decriminalize abortion cited the brutal effects of this gap between theory and practice: an estimated 5,000 women die in Mexico every year from botched back-street or self-administered abortions; a further 150,000 have to be treated in hospital every year and 1.5 million abortions happen every year. The penalty for a woman seeking an abortion is 1 to 5 years in prison. Everywhere on the earth where abortion is outlawed it still happens. The penalty in Saudi Arabia for performing an abortion is death, yet there are doctors that do it and get this penalty. Why? Nearly every picture you have ever seen regarding an abortion has been a lie. I know, the end justifies the means I guess. But most pictures are of donated fetuses preserved from a college. Most where still born. A Fetus just to the second trimester is only 3.5 inches long. And the brain has just over enough neurons to cause a heart to beat which happens 17 weeks into a pregnancy. Not enough brains for even a heart beat for 3 months. The Mortality rate on births before birth control was over 20%. This means the baby died and or the mother every five births. You dont want life. Pro-life is far from being for life. You want to make the choice of who should die. And if the fetus can not come to term then both should die. Because that is what Pro-life means; it means you take the choice from the woman and her medical staff. NO ONE is pro-abortionThat is sick. People are pro-choice, meaning they can not determine who should live or die. That is the choice of the host and her medical professionals who are sworn by oath to do something you can not seem to do. Defend life. A Fetus can not live without a host. It is parasitic in nature and requires service from a host. One thing any child should be guarantied in life is it gestated in a host that cared about its birth. Of the last five serial killers in the U.S. they had one thing in common among themselves; Just one common thing. They where adopted. Really really.. Fetal gestation requires a person to care for themselves. The fetus has a thin membrane between it and a slow death. Anyone can cause a failure in gestation; the path is as simple to follow as a double yellow line down a highway. Abortion can not be stopped. It has been here even before GOD talked to Moses. Mary whom Jesus defended was a prostitute that had no children. You tell me, how on earth does that happen?? As for the Bibles punishment for aborting a fetus?? Well, I am pro-choice but I think the bibles penalty for causing an abortion on a woman that actually wants the fetus to become a child to be pretty weak. Exodus 21[22] If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. The guy that causes a woman to abort?? Oh he is fined...Loses some cash. That will teach him. Funny thing though Pro-life people...I thought the fetus was a human??? Oh and Exodus is the mouth of God stuff, burning bush stuff. Funny, Pro-choice people would have a cow over this. I think prison should be required for the potential that was lost alone. But thats just me...Good old pro-choice guy.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","07:57 AM","abortion-debates","104"
