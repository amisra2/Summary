This one has to do with babys in the woumb ""Befor I formmed you in the woumb, I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet amoungst nations"" Jeremiah 1:4-5 I think this is rellavent because God wants everyone to be a prophet who he can work through.","richbrmly","279522","Interesting, so your argument is that I can stop the living God's plans for a prophet? Little me? Are you asking me not to pick on a God? That God needs my help in the production of a Prophet? If the Prophet in question were aborted then God could not say this. He was born and the statement can be made. Do you understand? God would not say this to something aborted. Because it never was or became someone. A God can say; before your mother met your father I knew you!"" Ok. Does that mean you where anything before your mother met your father? Isnt that the statement made here? He knew he would be what was to become (we call this a pretense, something that will be). Clearly a God would not say this to something he knew would never be. Who can stop the plan of a God? Me? You? Where is your faith? If God outlines a penalty for causing an abortion on a woman that wants her fetus to become a child, and that penalty is clearly far less than the penalty for the death of a child. What can be determined from this?","god-doesnt-want-abortion","06:50 PM","abortion-debates","107"

This is how the Bible can say ones soul is moved; saddened; joyous. Etc. I think therefore I am. Meaning a soul is emotional and so it really has no body. The soul is what we ask the Lord to preserve. 1Peter 1[9] Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls. Hamburger does not have a soul, it is dead meat. People eat brains and all the pieces of an animal. No soul. The soul is consciences. Under some conditions it can return, not after death or before a brain though. We know that to be impossible. Fetuses do not get emotional; there is no mind to speak of. No soul there to trouble. If youre on a machine and a doctor determines your brain is dead, the soul is not there. The body could see hell or heaven and there is no emotional effect. No soul for that. Read the Bible. Dont listen to fools; youre a person with a soul. Use it.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","08:13 PM","abortion-debates","109"
"08-20-2007","9979",8,"None","None","None","Axolotl","279558","Since the passage references being known even before formation in the womb, stands to reason that it does not apply to abortion, unless thinking about getting pregnant, and then changing one's mind, is a sin too. Of course there is also the matter as to whether or not one accepts the bible as a literal authority, or believes that all others must follow their faith. I do not accept the bible as my literal authority but one is certainly free to not have an abortion, and not change their mind about any pregnancy, if such an idea occurs to them.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","08:15 PM","abortion-debates","110"

"08-21-2007","9979",8,"None","None","None","richbrmly","279616","No woman in history has ever died for a Fetus. They have died for what a fetus will become; true. Lets say she decides to die so the fetus may continue for an argument. No one has total ownership of their own life. Their lives are owned by all the love them. This is why suicide is so wrong. You hurt the ones you love by taking something precious to them; you. Her life has value after all. If the woman has children at home; she takes their mother. If she would have aborted and could have had three future children, her decision prevented the births of those children in the same way an abortion would. She wasnt alive to have them. So the decision to abort is a complex issue that no one should decide other than the host and qualified medical staff. A Pastor is hardly a realist enough to actually help someone with an actual issue.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","12:00 AM","abortion-debates","113"
"08-21-2007","9979",8,"chemist99a","279576","Really","Axolotl","279653","LOL, now that is open to interpretation. But seriously, I don't know why anyone even thinks there's such a thing as a literal interpretation of the bible. It's just not possible. It's all interpretation. People who claim ""literal"" interpretation are just saying that they have THE truth. And those who refer to the other view as the literalist one are being polite, but not taking the bull by its horns.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","03:38 AM","abortion-debates","114"

Under U.S. law, we each have total ownership of our lives, though we have responsibilities we may or may not accept. That is why individuals are basically free to commit suicide, though they may be neglecting their responsibilies to another -- like the parent who commits suicide when they have young children who will be influenced by the event. I agree that this should be the case by law. Though the host is free to include any other person in that decision-making process, whether it's a partner, spouse, relative, or a pastor. But those individuals should not have any right by law to partake in that decision-making.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","03:48 AM","abortion-debates","115"

It is real and detectable, we have advanced a great deal on our knowledge of the mind. At any point your memories die, you die and body lives on. We have seen this in nature as well.

Drugs can alter the mind and soul. People can be made angry, afraid, happy, and so depressed they can hardly breath. By chemicals. The soul is fleeting just as the bible describes. Some People believe the soul lives on. Houdini desperately wanted to believe this and memorized a word for his wife. Takes thought for such an event. People look for ghosts that have some connections to a place because of the events in their past. The memories they hold. We have a soul, anytime we can think. If we can not think, we have no soul. Christianity calls death sleeping. They have pushed the hope past the soul and added the body. The body is dead, but they believe it will live yet again.","god-doesnt-want-abortion","08:21 AM","abortion-debates","118"
