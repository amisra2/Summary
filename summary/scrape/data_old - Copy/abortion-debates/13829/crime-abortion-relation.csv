I'm pro-life. And if I'm unconvinced of this being a legitimate argument against abortion, imagine what the vast majority of pro-choice supporters would think. I don't intend in any way to denigrate your position. In fact, I've read many of your posts on the topic of abortion and you and I are on the same terms As far as religion is concerned, we vary vastly, but that's another topic altogether, lol. I've seen first-hand that the religious argument against abortion is utterly useless against those who don't believe or passively believe in the notion of God. But I do believe that we as sensible, rational, reasonable and logical human beings can present an argument that shows that abortion is, at its essence, the willful taking of a life of another human being. Some would call that murder. Others will dress it up with fancy misdirection. But in the end, it is what it is. I think the question that this particular post of yours begs is more along the lines of ""Why do we as a society (in general) think of this as something that is not only acceptable but sanctioned and funded by us? Whether it stems from some pent-up aggression of enslaved women (which very likely could be the case for a very large portion) or for some other reason..."" I think that's really what we need to get to the root of. How did we become such a ""civilized, rational and dominant"" species in this world when we show no disregard for the most innocent of all of us and even spurn our own future by allowing this to continue? And also, anybody who has ever taken a science course, especially a social science, understands that correlation DOES NOT prove causation. It makes it even more irrelevant when the correlation doesn't happen within a year or even a few short years but over 20+ years in which any number of circumstances could have caused a decrease in crime. Just food for thought and one reason not to put total faith in statistics. Statistics themselves aren't even factual when there is an inherent bias in all surveys and methods of obtaining statistics and then they can be further misconstrued, misrepresented, misinforming and flat-out lies when presented in certain ways. Not saying that you are misrepresenting them, I'm saying the people who conducted the studies and published the results could very well be misrepresenting them. Thanks for the post, Travis!","crime-abortion-relation","10:19 PM","abortion-debates","6"

It is the nice way to describe bias, it is what xcaliber infers when he says things like 'that is just your opinion'. It is what people allude to when they say things like ""says you"", ""who says?"", ""According to you"" etc... A subjective truth is an oxymoron, a subjective statement cannot be argued or debated, it is irrational. The existence of a subjective belief does not negate any truth, but the statement must be modified to become objective. This often confuses people. For instance: 1. Icecream is tasty <- subjective 2. Joe thinks icecream is tasty <- objective 3. Most people who try icecream think icecream is tasty <- objective 4. Everyone thinks icecream is tasty <- also possibly objective When people say things like 'ice cream is tasty' they ussualy mean 3. Objective means the opposite, independant and unhindered by the subject; his/her emotions, biases, illogic etc... All truth is objective, which is to say a fact of reality and not a perception alone. Our perceptions are 'correct' when they are objective, only when they are identical to the facts are they the facts. Where you could not say ice cream was tasty, you can say the speed of light is some finite value +- some error, you can say the planet most closely resembles a sphere of all the basic geometric shapes etc... Science is the essense of objectivism, it is completly founded on the search for truth about a reality that is common to all due to it's singularity. When gansao said he couldn't do it without subjectivism, he means that all he can really do is point out that some people have disagreed. An objective counter-argument would make claims about what IS not what some PERCEIVE TO BE . On a last note, definition is crucial in the communication of objective concepts as to reflect a common reality terms must have common meaning. The proof of any statement objectively will rely heavily on definitions and as such they will be ultimately circular, this does not reflect circular logic or the unreality of the component concepts but the nature of cognition and the inability to transmit pure thought.","crime-abortion-relation","04:36 PM","abortion-debates","71"

Nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed or Wishing wont make it so. 2. You cant eat your cake and have it, too. 3. Man is an end in himself. 4. Give me liberty or give me death. If you held these concepts with total consistency, as the base of your convictions, you would have a full philosophical system to guide the course of your life. But to hold them with total consistencyto understand, to define, to prove and to apply themrequires volumes of thought.

The idea of sensation -> knowledge is faulty, no one can gain knowledge through sensation; there must be a method of translation. The method of translation is reason, no perception is truly automatic, no knowledge a given; it is all the product of conceptual connections and thought. The only question that remains is whether those connections, that thought is consciously rational or left to the subconscious, to be influenced by bias and emotion. Why is reason objective? Simply put it's a mechanistic process which does not incorporate polluting factors because it's function can be precisely defined and it can be clearly observed that it does not. Reason as one's epistemology however a complete and closed set, much like faith. Outside of it, it cannot be supported because support requires reason. While reality is the ultimate judge of truth, the only correlation between reality and truth is that of logic. This is why someone with faith can happily survive every contradiction even one of facts vs belief for contradiction is itself based on logic and if one denies logic it holds no threat. Easily, it is not a matter of will; but a matter of understanding. Faith(formalized bias/subjectivism) may feel like a mountain to those infected by it; but in reality it can be cast aside like a feather but one must 'trust' that existence exists, which is to imply that there is a real world, which implies a truth independent of your 'past conditioning', which implies perception free of that. If I were to argue for objectivism to a complete mystic it would be impossible, but in this day and age no one is completely without some belief in logic. Many even call on science, which makes it extremely easy to make the case to them; either that or they start getting mystical on you. It's synonymous with reality in this context.","crime-abortion-relation","06:51 PM","abortion-debates","74"
