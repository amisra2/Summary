"","10-14-2011","13829","gansao","440737","When does a fetus become a 'person'?","theolddog","440745","The answer to that question depends very much upon which system of belief, ethics, and morals one subscribes to. For most Jews, it is at crowning during the process of birth. For the RC sect of Christians, it is at conception. Other Christian sects place it at different points along that continuum. This leads inexorably to the conclusion that there is NO one ""right"" answer. as a result, the proper course for the law is to remain silent and to leave the choice where it properly belongs - with each pregnant woman.","crime-abortion-relation","abortion-debates","16","09:28 PM"

You assert that a sentient fetus that can feel pain and stress should be painfully destroyed if the pregnant mother decides that what she wants? I am not anti abortion but I am against aborting a fetus that would suffer during a termination.","crime-abortion-relation","abortion-debates","20","05:57 AM"

Exactly so, since the choice of whether or not to accept the hypothesis that a fetus is sentient is very much a mater of discussion among those with the knowledge that gives their opinions weight.. 2. I believe in the strength of each woman's intellect that she is capable of choosing what is in her best interest, and her best interest is controlling. 3. YOU claim that the prohibition gains abortion is or should be a universal, and that corresponds to YOUR values when others disagree who are just as moral and ethical as you. Ideologues more often than not believe that their word is law in the universe.","crime-abortion-relation","abortion-debates","28","06:12 PM"

If the fetus is developed enough to suffer( and therefore sentient) it should be considered an individual and it should be very carefully considered before performing an abortion. You are the one claiming universal idealogies can you not read what you write? You are claiming that in every pregnancy from conception to term the pregnant woman should have the right to terminate the pregnancy for whatever reason she sees fit..if you do not understand that to be a universal idealogy to fit YOUR values then you really do not understand your own assertions","crime-abortion-relation","abortion-debates","31","07:57 AM"
"","10-16-2011","13829","theolddog","440836","And now we see the real motivation of the compulsory pregnancy crowd - to punish and denigrate women for daring to express their sexuality.","gansao","440838","Is getting pregnant and aborting the fetus an expression of sexuality? Is fecklessly getting pregnant by not using birth control( which I think EZ was getting at) expressing sexuality? I think we should know","crime-abortion-relation","abortion-debates","34","08:47 AM"
"","10-16-2011","13829","theolddog","440885","Thanks, Simone! I have three daughters and one granddaughter of child bearing age. Yes, I'm that old a dog! All of them have been raised with the idea that they know what is in their best interests, and they all are thriving. I wonder if any of the profetallifers who post here would dare to tell any of them that either they or the government are better able to determine the future of their pregnancies than they themselves are. I know that each of my wonderful women would show them the door - QUICKLY!","gansao","440890","Is there no limit of time for a termination in the US? Can one legally abort a fetus right up to term? Would your wonderful women agree that a fetus should be painfully ripped from the womb if it were that they did actually did feel pain? Maybe you are not man enough to ask the question because you sure as hell are avoiding it here. No wonder Simone likes you","crime-abortion-relation","abortion-debates","51","02:19 PM"

Just asking.","gansao","440907","Do you honestly think that a question of whether a fetus can be capable of feeling pain is a metaphysical question? Just asking. Pointing out your moral cowardice is not ad hominem when your moral cowardice is the driving point behind your assertion that because you cannot have an opinion on whether your 'wonderful women' can abort a sentient fetus so therefore no one can have an opinion on the matter on abortion except the pregnant woman. I also think that a cry of ad hominem is pretty rich coming from you considering you made this comment about me... '3. YOU claim that the prohibition gains abortion is or should be a universal, and that corresponds to YOUR values when others disagree who are just as moral and ethical as you. Ideologues more often than not believe that their word is law in the universe.'","crime-abortion-relation","abortion-debates","58","04:20 PM"
