Exactly so, since the choice of whether or not to accept the hypothesis that a fetus is sentient is very much a mater of discussion among those with the knowledge that gives their opinions weight... 2. I believe in the strength of each woman's intellect that she is capable of choosing what is in her best interest, and her best interest is controlling.. 3. YOU claim that the prohibition gains abortion is or should be a universal, and that corresponds to YOUR values when others disagree who are just as moral and ethical as you. Ideologues more often than not believe that their word is law in the universe.","gansao","440829","So if it was deemed by 'those with the knowledge that give their opinion weight' that a fetus can feel pain and stress during a termination you would agree that the termination should not be carried out..well done Then you are contradicting your last statement I claim nothing more than a termination should not be done if there is enough evidence that the fetus is sentient enough to suffer during the process. If the fetus is developed enough to suffer( and therefore sentient) it should be considered an individual and it should be very carefully considered before performing an abortion. You are the one claiming universal idealogies can you not read what you write? You are claiming that in every pregnancy from conception to term the pregnant woman should have the right to terminate the pregnancy for whatever reason she sees fit..if you do not understand that to be a universal idealogy to fit YOUR values then you really do not understand your own assertions","crime-abortion-relation","07:57 AM","abortion-debates","31"

The legacy of the pro-infanticide crowd is a sink full of bloody, dismembered babies.

"10-16-2011","13829",3,"gansao","440803","Simone darling .the mans sperm creates the fetus with the ovum(or is it ova?) Did no one tell you that? The subject is not about the fetus holders( we cannot say mother because the pregnant woman is not..by your definition..a mother) personal risk. If you are saying that only the people involved in a situation should have control of the situation you are opening a rather large can of worms. You may believe that a woman can deliberately destroy a sentient potential human but others may disagree. As a young nurse, Nadine witnessed the horror of late abortions. Now an MP, she says the law MUST be changed | Mail Online","simone","440854","Big F*ing deal! The piddling effort of contributing a teensy weensy little sperm. That's all a little sperm has to do with nine months of pregnancy, the burden put upon women. When men become pregnant and share the health and medical risks, they can have a voice in the matter. Until then, let them keep their mouths shut. Their relationship to parenthood is minimal -- and in most cases, after a child is born, a woman still bears most of the burden and responsibility for that child because men are so shiftless and irresponsible and uncaring.","crime-abortion-relation","12:02 PM","abortion-debates","38"

There are men like that.
