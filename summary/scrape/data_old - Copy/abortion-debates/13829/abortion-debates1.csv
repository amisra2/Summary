The Institute for Psychohistory reveals the child as a poison-container. Dont respond if you dont read the links. Some studies have outright claimed that abortion lowers crime, and there is Truth-based legitimacy to these studies. Interestingly, where abortion is legalized, crime rates drop over decades. While it is hard to precisely pinpoint causes, I have no doubt that abortion acts as a legal violence outlet that would otherwise end up in other violence outlets deemed to be crimes by society.","crime-abortion-relation","04:16 AM","abortion-debates","1"

Right? I do not belog to this group. Biological parents of our daughter decided against abortion and we are thankful to them for this. Now Ellie has her own 5 months old baby.","crime-abortion-relation","05:05 PM","abortion-debates","5"

I'm pro-life. And if I'm unconvinced of this being a legitimate argument against abortion, imagine what the vast majority of pro-choice supporters would think. I don't intend in any way to denigrate your position. In fact, I've read many of your posts on the topic of abortion and you and I are on the same terms As far as religion is concerned, we vary vastly, but that's another topic altogether, lol. I've seen first-hand that the religious argument against abortion is utterly useless against those who don't believe or passively believe in the notion of God. But I do believe that we as sensible, rational, reasonable and logical human beings can present an argument that shows that abortion is, at its essence, the willful taking of a life of another human being. Some would call that murder. Others will dress it up with fancy misdirection. But in the end, it is what it is. I think the question that this particular post of yours begs is more along the lines of ""Why do we as a society (in general) think of this as something that is not only acceptable but sanctioned and funded by us? Whether it stems from some pent-up aggression of enslaved women (which very likely could be the case for a very large portion) or for some other reason..."" I think that's really what we need to get to the root of. How did we become such a ""civilized, rational and dominant"" species in this world when we show no disregard for the most innocent of all of us and even spurn our own future by allowing this to continue? And also, anybody who has ever taken a science course, especially a social science, understands that correlation DOES NOT prove causation. It makes it even more irrelevant when the correlation doesn't happen within a year or even a few short years but over 20+ years in which any number of circumstances could have caused a decrease in crime. Just food for thought and one reason not to put total faith in statistics. Statistics themselves aren't even factual when there is an inherent bias in all surveys and methods of obtaining statistics and then they can be further misconstrued, misrepresented, misinforming and flat-out lies when presented in certain ways. Not saying that you are misrepresenting them, I'm saying the people who conducted the studies and published the results could very well be misrepresenting them. Thanks for the post, Travis!","crime-abortion-relation","10:19 PM","abortion-debates","6"
