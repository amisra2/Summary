I was hopeful that he would be able to be a good opponent, mainly because although he hasn't been here a year, he's been here a couple of months, (may 15th) and especially after he made a first post (although it kind of focused a bit too much on Canada), it looked to be a good debate. I still hold the same topic of debate open to anyone else, hopefully someone who has been here a bit longer and will actually continue the debate to its completion.","ringside-zachvac-vs-evan-flag-burning-debate","10:37 PM","ringside","16"
