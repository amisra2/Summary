Comments about debating tactics, strategies, etc., are welcome here. Please be advised that no participants of the on-going debate are allowed to post here. Enjoy the debate!","ringside-zachvac-vs-evan-flag-burning-debate","09:36 PM","ringside","1"

I would like to echo JPSartre12's sentiments thanking billsco for his efforts. Based on my few previous exchanges with Evan, I feel that he may have let himself be handcuffed with the resolution. It was my impression that his opinion is that one ought not burn a flag, not that burning a flag is not a Constitutionally protected activity. Even if he were to be successful in promoting the ""ought not"" argument, it would have no bearing on the resolution of the actual debate. Nevertheless, I hope for a spirited debate. Good luck to both Zachvac and Evan.","ringside-zachvac-vs-evan-flag-burning-debate","10:34 PM","ringside","3"

On a personal level, it really doesn't matter to me. I'm kicking the XXX of any flag burner that I see. I have a coworker that was a drill sargeant in Vietnam. When he got off the plane from finishing his second tour, somebody got in his face and called him a baby killer. My buddy dropped him like a bad habit. When the police came and heard what happened, they ""tuned him up"" as they threw him in the squad car for creating a disturbance and my buddy was allowed to continue on his way. Sometimes, just sometimes, justice IS swift.","ringside-zachvac-vs-evan-flag-burning-debate","12:50 PM","ringside","4"
"08-14-2006","8666",1,"None","None","None","electrolyte","227581","Well, Round 1 is in the books, and I must say I'm a bit disappointed. zachvac had a difficult task, as his opponent's approach was unknown at the time of posting. It seemed to me that he danced around the issue a bit before simply declaring that the Founding Fathers intended a blanket freedom of expression and insisting that ""offensive"" activities need to be protected. While I happen to agree with the former (and generally the latter), I think zachvac has not supported his case particularly well; perhaps Evan will put some pressure on him in this respect. I would have liked to have seen references to judicial rulings, Founding Fathers' statements, or citations of the Constitution in support of his point. Evan, on the other hand, took an approach that caught me totally by surprise... not that I feel that will get him much. First, if I'm not mistaken, the understanding was that the ""constitution"" referenced in the resolution is the U.S. Constitution, which means that appeals to Canadian Code is at best tangetially useful in this debate. Nevertheless, Evan seems to spend a lot of time on the Canadian Code. Evan's definition of ""violence"" leaves much to be desired for this context, and is ripe for the picking (apart) by zachvac, in my opinion. Additionally, Evan's incomplete citation of Section 433 of the Criminal Code of Canada led me to wonder what was left out. While I'll refrain from elaborating on this during the debate (as I'm not a participant), I feel that Evan is misrepresenting the statute and its intent, although the semantics are somewhat entertaining. Again, I fear that Evan may be handcuffed by the resolution and will have a tough time finding sources that support his resolved position, but -- again -- any case law he might be able to find would be helpful. However, it is my opinion that -- unless the debate is about Canadian law -- Evan needs to focus on the U.S. I think zachvac can hit the majority of Evan's response out of the park; however, the burden of proof is still upon zachvac as the affirmant to support his point. He could rebut Evan all day long and still lose the debate because he hasn't adequately argued his position. My take: Evan is fractionally ahead, even if only mostly by default. He is vulnerable, but even a ""draw"" would result in a victory for the negative side. Perhaps we'll see some heavier action in Round 2. (I'm hoping my current extreme fatigue hasn't compromised my reading comprehension or my writing skills...)","ringside-zachvac-vs-evan-flag-burning-debate","01:46 AM","ringside","5"
"08-14-2006","8666",1,"None","None","None","Steeeeve","227654","The Candanian courts tend to appeal to foreign law often which might be where Evan gets that idea. Recently the US courts have been going to some foreign law for guidance and this may very well be a tactic that could hold up in other courts. The US just seems to use the foreign law when it serves their wants though.","ringside-zachvac-vs-evan-flag-burning-debate","02:30 PM","ringside","6"
"08-14-2006","8666",1,"None","None","None","electrolyte","227686","I see that zachvac has offered a draw at the possible discrepancy in the resolution. This is a rather noble (not to mention fair) gesture, but I find myself hoping that Evan chooses to continue. zachvac has appropriately identified that which I felt handcuffed Evan: whether flag burning is ""offensive"" or ""unreasonable"" is not the topic of this debate (unless of course Evan can link either of these criteria with unconstitutionality). zachvac quickly and satisfactorily dispatched Evan's representation of ""violence"" in a way that I -- who happens to fancy himself a decent debator -- probably would not have had the restraint to do. He also addressed the arson statute and showed that it did not support Evan's point. While zachvac certainly dealt a powerful XXXX to Evan's arguments, I'd still like to see more positive argumentation for his stance. I'm interested to see how Evan will respond, should he choose to continue.","ringside-zachvac-vs-evan-flag-burning-debate","08:19 PM","ringside","7"

Without wanting to sound like Bill Clinton, what is the meaning of ""is"" in the resolution? Is the debate about whether flag burning ""is"" constitutionally protected (i.e. currently protected based on case law and previous interpretation of the Constitution) or whether flag burning ""is"" constitutionally protected (i.e. should be interpreted as being protected based on legal or moral grounds)? I didn't think this would end up so complicated. :\","ringside-zachvac-vs-evan-flag-burning-debate","01:41 PM","ringside","9"

Regarding nobility and continueing debate, I think the debate should continue based upon its original statement (using constitutionality) and should be as if examined under the wording of the Constitution of the United States, since Canada doesn't seem to have one. Evan should have known that from the start. Zachvac has no obligation to offer a draw and no authority to grant one.","ringside-zachvac-vs-evan-flag-burning-debate","02:29 PM","ringside","10"

You look at what the first amendment means in other cases and in Evans case he is going to have to pull a Breyer and try to apply foreign law.","ringside-zachvac-vs-evan-flag-burning-debate","03:37 PM","ringside","11"

I was hopeful that he would be able to be a good opponent, mainly because although he hasn't been here a year, he's been here a couple of months, (may 15th) and especially after he made a first post (although it kind of focused a bit too much on Canada), it looked to be a good debate. I still hold the same topic of debate open to anyone else, hopefully someone who has been here a bit longer and will actually continue the debate to its completion.","ringside-zachvac-vs-evan-flag-burning-debate","10:37 PM","ringside","16"
