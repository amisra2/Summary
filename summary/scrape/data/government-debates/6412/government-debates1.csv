What I would like to see is a sub government for the minority. With a second congress that has veto power over the majority when it comes to laws and issues that effect the minority. There must be some compromise possible. It seems that when the conservatives loose they are sore losers and attack the liberals.

"09-14-2005","6412",1,"None","None","None","Dzeron","162131","I say, we should just have the government leave non-voters alone. So if liberals are afraid of being ruled by conservative moralism, or conservatives are afraid of being ruled by liberal socialism, they can have the option of governing only themselves and not governing anyone else.","new-government","09:46 PM","government-debates","2"

The majority should always rule (like that quote I sent you) but the rights of the minority should not be infringed upon. I would say there aren't too many cases now where the government infringes upon others rights (although there are some). The only way to stop this is to get the people to believe this and change the law. Unless we have an all knowing ruler, this is the best way to do it.","new-government","10:22 PM","government-debates","3"

That way you would have a more representative House where even smaller parties(such as the Greens and the Libertarians) might be represented there. The President would still be elected in the traditional manner.","new-government","05:56 AM","government-debates","5"

Could that be one of the reasons why Voter turn out is so low ? People realise that no matter who they vote for one of big two will hold all the power.","new-government","11:13 AM","government-debates","7"

As long as a majority have full bellies and mindless entertainment, political change is not a consideration. Let me put it this way; if the general population had the ability to consider what we're (US) fiscally doing to their children and grandchildren, would they not demand political reform?","new-government","12:15 PM","government-debates","8"

We just had a primary here in Erie County and many of the same pea-brains on the County legislature are on the ballot in November. Looks like the ""taxpayer revolt"" that was supposed to bring massive change fizzled out. On the bright side, seven of the fifteen legislators are not coming back.","new-government","04:52 PM","government-debates","9"

But in terms of Christianity, I think it shouldn't matter if one person or all but one person were Christian in terms of government. Religion shouldn't be recognized by government, and the rights of Christians should be protected no matter how many people they have.","new-government","12:27 AM","government-debates","11"

Fundamentalists, due to their inflexibility, will take the biggest hit due to higher education becoming more widespread at the parenting level.","new-government","09:05 AM","government-debates","12"

Recent research conducted by BRG has found that the percentage of American adults who identify themselves as Christians has dropped from 86% in 1990 to 77% in 2001. During this same period, the population of America has increased by 9%. At the present rate of change, the majority of the American population will not be Christian by the year 2035.~ You do understand the statistical ramification of decreasing Christianity exceeding the birth rate? A primary purpose of higher education is expanding knowledge, which normally leads to individuals seeking additional knowledge on their own initiative without continued formal instruction. Not a good scenario for perpetuation of mythical belief systems unless one is on the control side of those circumstances. Using rhetorical labels such as liberal indoctrination to define higher education generally signifies a lack of higher education. Even conservatives such as myself are proud of our educations and the opportunities they offer for personal growth and assisting in our contributions to society.","new-government","11:32 AM","government-debates","14"

No wonder the US is in danger of losing its World lead in Technology and innovation if that is the attitude of some of its citizens. If you haven't noticed most of the architects of the Bush doctrine & even current memeber of the Government have went through the Higher Education system such as George Bush, Condi Rice, Paul Wolfowitz and Donald Rumsfeld. It must really fail at indoctrination if these people went through that system.","new-government","12:11 PM","government-debates","15"
