"09-18-2005","6412",2,"georged","None","A primary purpose of higher education is expanding knowledge, which normally leads to individuals seeking additional knowledge on their own initiative without continued formal instruction. Not a good scenario for perpetuation of mythical belief systems unless one is on the control side of those circumstances. Using rhetorical labels such as liberal indoctrination to define higher education generally signifies a lack of higher education. Even conservatives such as myself are proud of our educations and the opportunities they offer for personal growth and assisting in our contributions to society.","Bassman","163459","Hey, I'm just a working stiff who happens to be a Christian. If you think higher education is the end-all be-all, then you're sadly mistaken.","new-government","12:22 PM","government-debates","16"

What about people who take up a trade? Are they inferior to your elitist attitude? For your info, I'm a professional driver, I hold a commercial drivers' licence, can drive anything from a tractor-trailer on down and am doing very well without a bachelor's or a master's degree, thank you.","new-government","06:05 PM","government-debates","19"

Good luck in life with that attitude. Your post defined higher education as liberal indoctrination. Some people in contemporary society aren't, for a variety of reasons, some valid, others not valid, suitable for higher education. Every person who contributes to the welfare of a society is of equal moral value. Advancement of that society is dependent on those who go beyond the norm, be it in the social or hard sciences, commerce, or other endeavors that benefit more than the individual making those advances. The more people who are capable of going beyond the norm using higher education as a platform, the larger society's base of intellectualism becomes and the faster it advances in adapting to changing conditions. Your posts suggest that your ideology is composed of a fascist base driven by a fundamentalist belief system with a stated disregard for higher education. I suggest you take a look at higher education, past and present, on a global basis, as our world has evolved. In the 2003-4 academic year, the US experienced a drop in college and university enrollments for the first time in 30-years. Look at China and India, and to a lesser extent, Europe, where primary and secondary education has been empathized to a level encouraging continuing education where by 2010 China will surpass the US in science and engineering graduates. Whether you're aware of it or not, our educational system is generally failing and that's a strong indicator of a declining nation unwilling to accept change for whatever reasoning.","new-government","06:53 PM","government-debates","20"

It is seen as the best way for a person to gain skills that they would never get from working in a trade. It is also a good way for people of the working class to move away from the poverty of their birth place, in other words a great way to earn a decent living. I am surprised that an avowed conservative would be disdainful of someone working hard to better themselves, and yes it was hard work, even though my fees paid for me by the State I still had to work 6 days a week to pay for books and the like. I couldn't imagine what it would have been like if I had to pay my fees as well. If the number of Graduates from the Science and Tech subjects are decreasing that will almost certainly impact on the US World lead in that area. This will impact the future Economy of the US, people are concerned about out-sourcing of jobs in the service and industry sector at the moment. Imagine what it will be like in a few years time when companies can not able to recruit the amount of Graduates they need. They will outsource to Europe or China/India. It would probably be the death knell for the US Economy.","new-government","06:58 PM","government-debates","21"

I looked at full-time summer jobs of 8-12 hours a day between then semesters as a real break. But it was well worth it. The potential impact of declining higher education in the US resulting from both poor quality of primary and secondary education and lack of individual motivation/direction (money is not an issue for those scholastically inclined), is a very alarming statistic. When looking at abnormal amounts of public debt the US is amassing in a very short period of time, none of which is directed at future improvements to facilitate economic growth, diminished exports of technology will eventually devastate the already shrinking tax base and horrific payment imbalance. Add those factors to the migration from industrial to service economy and we're obviously being governed by lunatics living in the past. Unfortunately, many of our citizens also live in the past while relying on mythical belief systems and bent politicians for direction and the US is a democracy.","new-government","08:06 PM","government-debates","22"

Lifetime earnings for University grad are on average significantly higher then for non univeristy grads. A univeristy education is a tool, that helps people achieve things that they generally could not otherwise. You have a special skill that can I believe pay very well but is somewhat limited in the number of career options that it opens. People without a university education can achieve great things and go very far in life, but it is generally harder and not as likely.

The experience was a useful corrective to my assumptions about the reality of manual labour. Even if you never reach the ""top"" in your chosen occupation, a university education pays off in countless ways that cannot be remunerated. I'm talking here about the life of the mind.","new-government","12:45 PM","government-debates","24"

And, as you suggest, true mental growth started that never really slowed down.
