"12-29-2003","1476",1,"Crim","None","Yes, it is the government-implemented religion that says religion should not be in government, right?","unkerpaulie","29433","It is a group that believes in the non-existence of God, and that belief has excatly the same grounds to stand on as the belief in the existence of God. The existence and non-existence of God can neither be proven, and both are based solely on personal belief","secularism-belief-based","11:44 AM","government-debates","5"

It doesn't speak of the existance of any supernatural ideas.","unkerpaulie","29480","but religion and belief in the supernatural are almost inseparable. in fact you'll be hard-pressed to find a religion that isnt linked to some supernatural phenomenon. I agree that government and religion shouldnt be entangled. Im all for that. but my problem is the government's support for the anti-religious group. the point that I made in the first place is that both the belief in God's existence and the belief in God's non-existence are equally beliefs and nothing else. both are based on an unprovable idea. the government should be separate from both, because both are just as ""religious""","secularism-belief-based","10:13 PM","government-debates","7"
"12-31-2003","1476",1,"Crim","None","Then you're for secularism.","unkerpaulie","29655","you dont have to be for secularism to want government separate from religion. but actually, from this discussion I realized that its not the secular group in general I have a problem, but the anti-religious subset. as far as religion is concerned, there really does exist a neutral middle ground. I'll call that the ""toleratist"" group. I'm defining this as the truely unbiased and neutral group that cares neither for the fundamentals of religion nor the antagonism of anti-religion, and just figures that their both based on unprovable beliefs, but tolerates their beliefs regardless. this is where the Government should stand so we end up with 3 groups of people: the religious the anti-religious the ""toleratists"" the problem is that the anti-religious and toleratists get lumped into one group called ""secular"" (ie, not religious) (I hope you see the difference between ""not religious"" and ""anti-religious"") so to answer your original question, yes, I am for secular government (not necessarily secularism) but I think its equally important to identify the difference between neutral secularism and anti-religion. If the government is anti-religious, then its just as biased as a religious government","secularism-belief-based","09:29 AM","government-debates","9"

Otherwise, the ruling that Mormon plural marriages would/should not have been upheld. Why does the US have the motto ""In God We Trust""?","secularism-belief-based","09:09 PM","government-debates","10"
"01-03-2004","1476",1,"None","None","None","plotter","29944","Why are most secular countries in the west. Why? becuse of christianity, most western countries base there laws on the 10 commandments, though shall not kill etc. Therefore secularism is a religous based concept, wether the country is muslim or christian the laws are based on that particular religion, except sharia law. So France the U.S etc, are not really secular, if they were, they would be almost anarchistic.","secularism-belief-based","03:58 PM","government-debates","11"
"01-03-2004","1476",1,"None","None","None","plotter","29950","Im not sure of the %, but what i do know is that most laws originate from the religious teachings, 10 commandments etc..... Seperating state and religion is not possible as a high % of laws are derived from religion. Also laws are based on the wishes of the populace, hence you may have sharia law, however in so called secularist countries the laws are based on religious teachings and morals, not the religion itself.","secularism-belief-based","04:36 PM","government-debates","13"
"01-03-2004","1476",1,"None","None","None","plotter","29960","Religion is based on morality, (except extremist views). the law is also based on a moral concept, morality that is accepted by the majority, therefore laws are formed from that morality. So the laws that govern a country and its religion are always connected. In courts witnesses are asked to ""swear to tell the truth so help them god"", there are lots of countries that use the motto ""in god we trust"". most christian countries use christ or jesus as symbols in there laws, islamic countries use mohamed or texts from the koran. Also some countries use the cross on there flags others the star and crescent, so obviously, to me, a secularist country cannot seperate itself from its core religion.","secularism-belief-based","06:53 PM","government-debates","15"
