"01-03-2004","1476",2,"Crim","None","That's tradition, not law. No one is required to say 'so help me god' at the end of their oath. The vast majority of laws are pragmatic, not religious.","montalban","29978","Although there is a Christian influence on modern western law, it is not exclusive. Outside courts is Janus, the pagan god of justice; remembering the debt to Rome. In this country, you have the option of making an 'affirmation' - if you aren't religious - where you make a formal declaration that your testimony is truthful. So you don't need to swear on a Bible. I'd imagine it is the same in the USA","secularism-belief-based","10:19 PM","government-debates","17"
"01-10-2004","1476",2,"unkerpaulie","None","the objective of the first amendment was to establish a government neutral from belief-based groups, neither in endorsement nor in prohibition. this is a concern is because it can be argued the the world is made up of 2 kinds of people: religious people, and secular people (secular being defined as non-religious). the very definition of secularism ties it to religion as being directly opposite, but defined by the same standards furthermore, the belief that the supernatural doesn't exist has exactly as much evidence to stand on as the belief that the supernatural does exist: none . neither possibility can be proven, therefore both are based on belief Is it fair for the government to prefer the secular group over the religious group, when they both are ""belief"" based groups?","treat2","30742","OK U.P., Let's Assume You Are Right... Let's further assume that I am a nudist (which I aint), and that I believe that the naked body is and expression of freedom. So, now I wanna use my Free Speech Rights and walk into work without my cloths on, I wanna go to Jury Duty without my cloths on, I wanna sit next to your kids without my cloths on, and I generally wanna be in your face when ever I please, which a reason because it's a political decision you don't like, that I will make an extra effort to make sure that my butt is in your face, as often as possible! Sorry, but your definition of freedom is not consistant with your argument, because you would object to my butt in your face, and my walking around naked where ever you go. Freedom does not mean Anarchy. There are limits to Freedom, that are implicitly understood in the 1st Amendment use of the word ""free"". No, I don't wanna see some religious group haging outside my doctor's office, becuase they don't believe in doctors. No one is preventing anyone from practicing religion IN THIS COUNTRY. You're position is not well thought out, as shown by my example. There quite reasonalby are places that I don't want to go into and be made to feel like I walked into a Church. If you can't do enough praying during the day, spend more time at it with others of your religion in appropriate places, like your church or your home. ONE LAST POINT... the absurd argument that is being made by Christians about being more persecuted than anyone else, truely amazes me. It tell me that these Christians have no concept of what persecution is and means, and are lying to themselves about what is REALLY GOING ON! Consider this... Mist Americans are Christians, most Judges are Christians, most people in electied office aree Christians, the group that donate the most money to politicians are Christian, SO.... The basis for that argument falls apart entirely, as it can only be saying that Christians are persecuting Christians! Now that;s a really stupid arrgument for those folks to make. ON THE OTHER HAND, these highly persecuted Christian amy beleive that the ATHEISTS get fair and preferential treatment , and are probaby in bed with whe Christian Jidges that are denying other Christians of their religions. The further the Argument of Christian persecution is taken, the more absurd it becomes.","secularism-belief-based","02:43 AM","government-debates","18"

There is no absoulte freedom of speech for US citizens as under the US constitution; you can still face prosecution for slander, bespeaking government secrets, spreading lies so as to cause a public nuisance. You can't graffiti private property to 'express' yourself. You can't stand in the middle of a public road, blocking traffic, to preach to the people. etc","secularism-belief-based","04:33 AM","government-debates","19"

I'm not a good enough studend of American History to definitively say if ANY of the Founding Fathers were amongst the numbers of people that came to our continent to escape religious persecution in Europe. I was taught many people came here for that reason, however I expect that aside from the lapse of a number of years between the time the Bill of Rights was Written, and that during that time< I expect people came here for very differnt reasons, than to escape religious persecution. As I was saying... I'm not a good enough studend of American History to definitively say if ANY of the Founding Fathers were amongst the numbers of people that came to our continent to escape religious persecution in Europe. BUT IF ANY OF THEM DID come here for that reason, I suspect we underestimate their wisdom in ensureing a clear separation between Church and State. ONR COULD REASONABLY assume that the Founding Father could have had less insight, and taken the EXACT OPPOSITE approach, in which they could have Joined ALL Relgions with the State, and ensured that anyone of any religion would be so well integrated, and so many times specified inour Bill of Rights, that everywhere anyone went, all sorts of religious activity would be occuring. Our landscape could look quite differnet.... more like the extremist variety that complains of sever persecution in America, or perhaps our society would look more like the Societies in which all are called to roayer 7 times a day, clothin on our women might reveal nothing from the top of the neck downware, or perhaps not even a clear glance at a woman's eye's behind a webbed garment. Perhaps the NBOW could have been written to encourage the deveopment of prayer rooms in every bisiness, or maybe just make everyone feel like they were always in Church? The only solution to that one would be to XXXX my head off. Nope. I'm treasure all laws that can be used to keep the religious right as contained as legally possible, today. I suspect that if the religious right was less concerned with attempting to shove their religion in everyone else's face, the entire notion of being persecuted would disaper entirely, as would this thread.

"01-10-2004","1476",2,"plotter","None","Religion is based on morality,.... .","treat2","30768","WHAT I SAID BELOW IS NOT ENTIRELY TRUE... A SERCH OF A nET DICTIONARY PROVIDES A NUMNBER OF DIFERENT DEFINITIONS FOR RELIGION and they are listed below refer to #2 for SOME ASPECT THAT INCLUDES YOUR OWNyour own. HOWEVER, IT IS APPARANT THAT RELIGION IS NOT BASEDD ON MORALITY, EVEN BY THE DEFINITION PROVIDED IN #2. yOUR DFINITION IS TOO LIMITTED TO BE ENTIRELY TRUE . ON THE OTHER HAND, YOUR DEFINITION IS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE DEFINITION GIVEN IN #2 AND IT'S UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT PPL TO REPEAT A DECTIONARY VERBATUM, SO i CAN ACCEPT YOUR PREVIOUS STATEMENT THAT Religion is Based on Morality, however at the same time I believe that the statement is not acccurate and misleading, as it is a ""BLANKET"" STATEMENT ABOUT RELIGIONS Without any qulification, and one would assume that you percieve the asingle aspect to be what religion is, and when taken to the global exctent as I'm attempting dto do, the statement you made is not accurate. However, it is not accuratee that no definition of religion or meaning of religion MAY include this as a major aspect.of that definition. I believe you are mistaken. and not using any definition of Religion that would be commonly used or found . I conclude that if you maintain Religion is based on Morality, a Definition of Religioun would include the SPECIFIC word ""morality"", NOT TO BE MISTAKEN WITH: ""a commonly held set of beliefs"" or a ""common philosophy"" Unless, you can find anything to back that up, I won't mention it further.
