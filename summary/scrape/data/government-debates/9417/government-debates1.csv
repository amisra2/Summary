What would be the purpose of empowering the poor and the weak to influence the actions of the rich and the strong? I can agree that it is reasonable to expect the rich and strong to raise the conditions of the weak and poor. But, they can not be allowed influence to bring the rich and strong down. What good there is in life flows from the rich and the strong. Koffi surely agrees with me on this, else why would the food for oil event have been tolerated?","kofi-annans-five-lessons","08:34 AM","government-debates","5"
