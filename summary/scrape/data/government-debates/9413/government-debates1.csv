"03-22-2007","9413",1,"None","None","None","Zardoz","255242","Cool. From this I learnt that The world is a sinking ship and there is only a few life preservers and the multitudes of unfortunates will try to pull you down with them, so, you must jealously guard your status in life and use every means to keep your resources and to take the resourses of the others...because you can never be too sure if you have enough. I'm thankful I live in America where we attempt to do so...often unsuccessfully, because of all the dead weight who think it's better to have drowning victims think well of them than to have abundant resources. And speaking of resource, I'm STILL waiting on my cheap oilz we're supposed to be stealing and/or trading blood for. I am fondly reminded of South Parks lesson on Gods and Clods...maybe we should eliminate more of the clods, we'll at least the unproductive ones who are little more than ticks in the fur.","tells-you-something-doesnt","06:27 PM","government-debates","4"

"05-30-2007","9413",1,"None","None","None","conservative","265540","I like how it puts everything into perspective, I would also like to echo pandion in my reaction. Also, Symbiote, if you notice, many of the mistakes your corrections point out are irrelevant to this article as it is slightly different.","tells-you-something-doesnt","04:10 PM","government-debates","7"

"05-31-2007","9413",1,"None","None","None","conservative","265740","That was not my point... Some things in the article had been corrected or fixed... Not all of the errors mentioned were erroneous on this source... There were still a lot of mistakes but not as many as it seemed.","tells-you-something-doesnt","02:58 PM","government-debates","9"
"05-31-2007","9413",1,"None","None","None","Phunting","265767","But still if an article is willing to make up figures, to whatever extent, in order to prove its point I don't place much faith in its worth.","tells-you-something-doesnt","05:30 PM","government-debates","10"
