Today we can reveal the incredible rise of CCTV with one Welsh street containing a staggering 73 spy cams in less than half-a-mile. Wales on Sundays count on Cardiffs St Mary Street and High Street, which runs as one 800m road, equates to one every 11m. But private and public cameras were most prolific in Swanseas 240m-long Wind Street Swansea, where we spotted 34 or one every seven metres. Newports 320m High Street had 20, one every 16 metres, while Llandudnos Mostyn Street had just 10 over a 1,200m stretch, or one every 120 metres. In the capital, Cardiff Council defended the figure in one of the citys main thoroughfares, busy with shoppers and workers by day and heaving with partygoers by night. A spokesman said: The cameras in St Mary Street are used to monitor traffic but also the police use them to monitor crime and disorder. If there are any accidents, information can be put out to tell people to avoid the area. Theyre quite useful. And South Wales Polices Inspector Tony Bishop said: They are one of the most effective tools to tackle crime because they provide crime prevention, crime detection, and evidence gathering for the courts. Barely a pace can be walked down any high street in the country without hundreds of images of shoppers being gathered by public and private organisations. Spies in the sky sit atop lampposts, adorn walls and peer from doorways at passers by. They snap speeding drivers and motorists running red lights. So common are they that hardly anyone notices the long eye of the lens in our towns and cities anymore. There is no official record of camera numbers as shop owners do not need planning permission to put up CCTV. The result is thousands of cameras watching our every move Britain is the most heavily observed country in the world. The latest studies show there are 4.2 million surveillance cameras in the UK, or one for every 14 people. Whether they make us safer is debatable. Mark Dziecielewski, of civil liberties group Watching Them Watching Us, said: Politicians like cameras because they are seen to be doing something. But just like you see birds perched on scarecrows, the hoodies and dealers come back once the novelty has worn off. Having so many cameras in one place actually makes police investigations harder because they have to divert so much manpower into checking footage from every single camera. A spokesman for AXA insurance said CCTV did not necessarily reduce business premiums, adding: They are usually installed for the peace of mind of the owners. Insurers are more interested in the physical security shutters, grilles and an alarm connected to the police station. But doubts over their effectiveness has not deterred businesses from snapping up cameras, which are much cheaper than they once were. Smart Protection Systems Daniel Botterill said: The quality of the standard cameras was always pretty good, but people were put off by the video recording equipment. To get a good picture you would have to change the tape every three hours. Digital technology changed all that. A typical machine will now record continuously for three months. It used to cost thousands and has only become affordable for ordinary shops in the last five years. The Walkabout chain which has pubs in Cardiff, Newport and Swansea has CCTV watching drinkers at every bar. A spokesman said: All Walkabout venues have security cameras that record inside and outside the venues 24 hours a day, every day. We have them in place to ensure that all of our customers have a safe and fun Walkabout experience. http://rinf.com/alt-news/surveillanc...er-street/827/ Do you think this infringes on the Publics rights, to be so heavily observed 7/24/365 ? Is it proper to utilize technology just because it exists without seeking the approval of the Citizenry it is being used against ? Because of the threat of terrorism, do you support such heavy use of CCTV and would you support its use everywhere ? Are we sacrificing our freedoms for security and is it a fair exchange in the long run ?","too-much-big-brother","08:32 AM","government-debates","1"

Keeping surveillance to know trouble areas(mostly in city centres) may be ok. As a general rule the less the better. I suspect the terrorist aspect may be overblown. If a suicide bomber comes zooming in, CCTV will only record what happens. It can't stop it, as the individual whether on foot or in a vehicle is unlikely to have a warning sign displayed.","too-much-big-brother","11:22 AM","government-debates","3"

The difficulty for me is liking the security protection aspects of cameras while hating the intrusion of honest peoples movements while in public.","too-much-big-brother","04:40 PM","government-debates","4"
"07-26-2007","10159",1,"None","None","None","Ripskar","275552","I've seen several aspects of these cameras; 1) They're positioned so that they can look into peoples flats along the main road. Serious intrusion of privacy if ever there was one. 2) Drug dealers/users now do their businessout of LoS of the cameras, ie, behind shops and other businesses which causes problems for people who work there. 3) The Police ones tend to be automatic, you can tell by the way they move whether or not anyone's controlling them. 4) Drunks brawling don't take notice of the cameras and the police tend to hang back until things have calmed down and use the evidence on tape if the want to prosecute. 5) Brunstrom is infamous for his campaign against motorists, I know people who've been done for doing 32 in a 30 zone. The cameras are the mobile type and frankly are used as a cash cow. 6) Terrorist threat, in Wales? Glasgow was a bit off the beaten track for Islamists, the IRA have disarmed and Welsh seperatists confine themselves to graffiti and petty vandalism. No dice.","too-much-big-brother","05:35 PM","government-debates","5"

I can't understand why people are bothered by cameras posted in public places. Who really cares? If they are used properly, they can be quite effective in documenting criminal activity. I myself, as someone who does not commit crimes on a regular basis, find no reason to fear these cameras. If some guy sitting at a desk watching tapes watches me pull my underwear out of my crack as I walk down the street...I could care less. I hope he enjoys the show. It is not being used against the citizenry. They are used against people who break the law. If you don't want it to be used against you, don't break the law. Like airports, train stations, bus depots, chemical factories, nuclear facilities, etc etc. Yes, I fully support that. As far as out in the general public, yes, I support that as well. I do not however support the use of cameras on private property without the consent of the owner. Again, what rights and freedoms are we giving up? The freedom of drug dealers to deal in peace without the fear of being observed by the police? The freedom to XXXX red lights without consequence? The freedom to knock old ladies over and steal their pocketbooks? Damn, I'm going to miss those carefree days.","too-much-big-brother","03:02 AM","government-debates","7"

If so do you have any points on your license? 2mph seriously isn't a huge ammount and neither your speedo or the mobile cameras are usually calibrated to be that accurate.","too-much-big-brother","05:07 AM","government-debates","8"

My suspicion is that the claim is a myth put about by the pro-speeding lobby. And no, I don't drive. However, my Dad has driven every day for 30 years and has no points on his licence nor has he ever been stopped for speeding or any other driving offence. My Mum has been driving 20 years and likewise never been stopped.","too-much-big-brother","05:31 AM","government-debates","9"
