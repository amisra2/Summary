I'll attempt to explain Freedom's position but it is so ridiculous I might not be able to think that illogically. Here it goes....... Freedom feels that taxation is immoral basically equating it to taking money without permission. His thoughts are that we should just have the government be a Walmart where you pick and choose what services you want and pay for it and thus no taxation. Now, what I can't explain is: 1) why Freedom thinks taxation is immoral 2) why government couldn't just bundle all the services together and charge (thus having the same system we have now) 3) How, if everyone were charged the same price, the country would even remotely survive. Good luck on this one.","government-taxes","03:00 PM","government-debates","2"

Libertarian is not anarchy just like Democrat is not communism. More to the point, the fireman actually benefits the neighbors as well. If the neighbor on either side has the ""fireman service"" than they want that fire out before it ruins their own house and land...not to mention the property value of having a pile of rubble next to you. Not all services are like this but police, fire, etc are all not best handled by the private sector because they provide a collective benefit...always.","government-taxes","05:02 PM","government-debates","4"

"08-02-2011","15541",1,"Freedom","436074","I have answered this question many times, since it is a simple answer I will give it again. Governments require money, it does not matter where that money comes from as long as it's reliable. Theft is not the only reliable source of income, therefore there is no reason theft should be necessary to fund something. The system would work by protecting the rights of citizens and enacting social actions of citizens with money from citizens that citizens agreed to pay because they want to enact social actions and they want their rights to be secure. This answer which is so glaringly obvious that I cannot understand how one could fail to see it before one asked has been asked dozens of times, more than that the answer which has been given dozens of times has been ignored. This is not the pattern of an honest questioner pointing out an overlooked flaw in a plan. It is the pattern of a brainwashed acolyte who in stunned disbelief pushes the answer out of their minds because they don't want to believe it can be answered. For twenty centuries humans cut out the hearts of a human beings so that the gods would allow their civilization to live. In all that time, no one asked ""Is it necessary to spill blood for the sun to rise?"" and got any answer but ""Of course"". They in their their time may have encountered another who claimed the sun would rise regardless of the sacrifices. They might ask ""how can the sun rise without sacrifices?"" The question here isn't ""How would it work without taxes"", it's ""Why does it need taxes to work?"" History is there to learn from, not to copy. The equation is only in doubt by madmen. The issue is that some believe that a ruling group of humans (be it majority, nobility, clergy, committees, or warlords) don't need the permission of other humans to take their money. Walmart wouldn't work if it could only offer all of it's products in a bundle, that doesn't give it the right to force people to buy that bundle. The way people choose to pay for things has nothing to do with 'thus no taxation'. It is 'taxation is immoral, thus no taxation'. You haven't put much effort into that reading the answers to that question have you? No one would support it, it's illogical; people don't want to pay for things they don't agree with.... not when there is no sane reason why everything should be bundled. If you started with a bundle, people would consistently vote it lower so that they could spend more on the things they wanted to, ending up where we should start. You mean nobody could survive a fair tax, that is true; but it is the result of a faulty system that money was made available that never should have been. How much of government spending is really police, fire dept, infrastructure, and military? I kept posting that link because it is the response to anyone claiming anything that is parsed by my brain into 'where is your support'. Xcalibers repetitive accusations of imaginary day dream personal opinion is thus parsed. But please, make every effort to understand my view. You may ask any questions you wish. If they are taxes your consent doesn't matter. If your consent is required (it is morally) than it is not a tax, but in fact a moral transfer of wealth.... but only for you because you are the only one who consented. I hope you don't think this rhetoric is an argument. It in fact resembles a smear campaign more closely than a genuine insinuation which is itself a far cry from any kind of rational response. Lol, that's a definition of atheist I haven't heard before. So an atheist can never be wrong because he sets his own morality, are we contrasting this with a theist who can be wrong.... provided that god comes down and contradicts him Anyway I have already said many times and in the thread referenced that I reject the authority premise in ethics.","Matthew S","436077","Your system and answer to funding government requires, altruism and sacrifice both of which you hold in the highest contempt, remember?

What I am proposing is exactly like an apartment building, What you are proposing is a landlord who forces you to live in their building and pay whatever price they demand even though there is a whole city of housing out there. The landlord does more though, it charges more for your apartment for no other reason than you have more to take. It is the right of each person to decide if he wants to live in and pay for an apartment building. Under that premise it is simply a matter of practical reality that until people all agree on not only what needs to be paid but how much; there is no sense in bundling, there isn't even any then it just wouldn't hurt.","government-taxes","04:39 PM","government-debates","11"

Lets call those people Mayors, Representative, Governors, Council Members and Supervisors similar to what currently exists now. I assume these people will have a certain degree of latitude to perform their duties and address issues as they arise without having to go to the people every time something happens. I also assume that they will have people to assist them as some of these projects can be large and take a very long time to complete again similar to what currently exists. So far the two have more in common than they do different, but lets look at the money. Where it comes from on the one hand is from everybody regardless of whether they use all of the things that it is used to build or maintain. This is due to the belief that the cost will be less and the benefits will be greater and makes for a more streamlined process. The alternative is only things that people want at the time are implemented and only by those who want them. That will make everything more expensive and take longer to implement. It is unclear how the use will be restricted to those who paid or how people who move into an area or move out of an area will be effected. Does their interest become something that can be willed or sold? Can someone buy interest others own (if they do) and thereby earn a profit of that interest? Will the costs to market a proposed project, including answering questions and drumming up support, setting up a way to vote, counting and certifying the vote etc included in the cost? What if it doesn't pass do donors lose that money? Back to the apartments. We have argued this before but I am still of the opinion that your acceptance of citizenship is by choice and with that comes certain obligations. One of which is taxes. You are free to go to any other country who will accept you just as you can go to any apartment within a city. The landlord or government says this is what I charge and these are the rules take it or leave it. Your problem is not with taxes since you acknowledge the population does have to pay for these things it uses. Your problem is that someone somewhere is telling you what you will pay for and how much you are going to pay for it. In other words you probably have a problem with authority in almost any form. A volitional society is not going to make that go away. There will still need to be people in charge and they are still going to make stupid choices that negatively impact a large number of people. The solution is to make government more accountable and for people to participate in their government like it was important. That includes being aware of what their Representative are doing and how it will effect them. The government we have works great on paper and if we can make it closer to that model in real life things would be much more to everybody's liking.","government-taxes","06:30 PM","government-debates","12"
