The US was going to fall because of the communists, the hippies, there were going to be race wars, class warfare. It was going to be big and mean and bad and bloody.","final-hour-united-states","05:23 AM","government-debates","2"

But I am sure this nation will fall, non-violently I hope, as every other giant empire has before. America seems to have an aura of invincibility emanating from it at the moment and we're still the strongest economy in the world. But one day our powers will be trite. We will subside as a superpower eventually, but as of now we're still an infant nation.","final-hour-united-states","09:40 AM","government-debates","3"

"02-03-2004","1694",1,"None","None","None","mamboni","33653","I don't believe America's full demise will be witnessed by this generation, though things will start to deteriorate once China grows larger. Still, we've got a lot of economical ties to Asia and they serve as a backbone to our economy to some extent so I don't foresee any sparring between America and China.. well, not anytime soon. We're both pretty dependent on one another, so it's more mutual. Rest assured, our nation will collapse - well I wouldn't be that harsh, but our superpower stature will shrink quite a bit over the next few decades, I believe. However, I don't think it will be a total end, just a slurred deterioration.","final-hour-united-states","01:47 PM","government-debates","6"

I was having this debate with somebody else, but the point is, britian could do whatever it wanted, beat whoever it wanted, but as britian was, so soon will be the U.S., its all a matter of time. But if you were talking about the death of the U.S. the country, where the U.S. on the maps would be like ""Canada south"", then that will be years and years and years away.","final-hour-united-states","04:07 PM","government-debates","9"

Many non superpowers around the world have a standard of living comperable to ours.

"02-03-2004","1694",1,"None","None","None","AMD4EVER","33762","Personally I see the US eventually collapsing because the system of our world becomes much more complicated. I believe the US will be around 100 years from now and will probably still be a power to be dealt with. However there are many things that could cause the entire system we live under today to complete collapse. For one thing the development of extremely advanced AI put into use for political purposes eventually leading to a much more logical way to structure the way different countries deal with each other. It may even lead to dissolving borders or combining economies and governments. Lets not forget that the entire idea of countries has changed a whole lot in the last 1000 years, even the last 400 years since the colonial days, and change is moving a whole lot faster now. I also won't under estimate the idea of a 1984 or a Jennifer Government type of system coming into place if control or economics becomes vastly more influential over the world. Basically I don't think the US will fall at all. I think that it will evolve into something different than it is right now.","final-hour-united-states","07:25 PM","government-debates","11"

With two superpowers in the world that are as different as black and white you will eventually be able to draw a line between countries who are allied with one and countries who are allied with the other. Once one of those countries attacks the other sides country it could mean another world war. The Cold War with Russia was a miracle in that it didn't break out into a war. I don't like having to press my luck with China being the next superpower when they are so similar to what Russia was. That is my major fear. However I do see that China is changing in that they are becoming more open and democratic. Perhaps by time they become a superpower they will have let the idea of invading Taiwan go as well as their belief that Korea belong to them. If that occurs then the two superpowers would probably act as a check and balance between each other and prevent any other Iraq style invasions from occurring simply with their political and economic sway over each other. If that ended up being the case then it would be beneficial to have two superpowers. It would also be nice if the US had a challenge in the world so our freaking government would clean up the corruption and become more efficient. Heck, look what it did for Intel when AMD started to finally give them some competition. The companies are both better than they were before the competition and the customers are happier with both of them as well. Personally I am routing for China to become a superpower by 2020 along with India, the EU, Russia, and an alliance of Japan/Australia/Taiwan/South Korea becoming very powerful themselves.","final-hour-united-states","07:35 PM","government-debates","13"

Today it is unrealistic and the result has been a relatively peaceful time. Then you see the fall of communism which has resulted in much of the world globalizing and being much more open. Both of these things could be seen as steps towards countries eventually merging with each other as you are starting to see with the EU. They are standardizing currencies and opening their borders to each other because of this lasting peace and their economic dependence on each other. Governments are of course changing with these times as well or getting left behind as a third world country. This is basically what I mean by our system based on countries changing. It isn't hard to believe that one day Canada and the US could be one country or that Europe could become one country without there being a war. I believe I used the wrong word when I mentioned AI. We cannot teach programs to understand a whole lot right now nor will we be able to for quite a while. What I meant to refer to was computers as a whole helping to run this country. We are depending a lot more on computers evaluating things for us so we can make better decisions. Since this is so important there will be a greater and greater push for better programs to do more complex evaluating for us in the future. Perhaps 50 years from now we will have gone so far as to have programs that can evaluate when to cut tax rates and how best to spend our tax dollars while maintaining a balanced budget. Efficiency would jump a thousand fold doing this which in turn will help countries become much, much more stable. Computers would assist politicians in preventing instability which in turn would create an even more peaceful world and help give us answers to other worldly problems. Perhaps this change would lead to far less crime, less poverty, less environmental destruction, and true stability in our world which in could lead to there being no reason to have separate countries from each other. This is of course an extreme example based on the time frame but it is a route we may at least head towards which would result in our next major evolution in how the world works.","final-hour-united-states","08:14 PM","government-debates","14"
