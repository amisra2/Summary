First you attack him for not doing enough to prevent terrorism, then you attack him when he actually does something to prevent it. If in doing this it prevents another 3,000 people from being murdered, why is it wrong. Personnally, if an impeachment happens, it won't last long. After all the left tried to hit Tom Delay, and they went on false acuasations, as they are now doing to our president. He could have prevented another 3,000 people from dying.","impeachment-president-open-letter-house-judiciary-committee","10:45 PM","government-debates","18"

It says that it's illegal for the government to perform wiretaps without court approval. What makes what Bush did so incredibly stupid and arrogant is that FISA courts are a virtual rubber stamp, and you can get approval after the fact. There's no legitimate reason for Bush to have gone around the courts, he simply doesn't want any laws to apply to him. It doesn't matter what the president is doing, he is never, ever, above the law. I won't speak for the other 2,999, but I do not place my own life above the values and principles that make this country great.

Those are some whacked out options. You could have at least offered ""both"" as an option. I think he definitely oversteeped his boundries. I think what he did is undeniably ""technically"" illegal. But I don't want him impeached for it. It's not like he lied about a XXXX job or anything serious as that. He only mislead the nation to a war.

Isn't it possible that he made a mistake? If anyone should be blamed for leading us into war, it's the CIA. There is no proof or even a little bit of evidence that suggests that Bush tried to manipulate the CIA into saying that there were WMDs. Because, I mean even if Bush wanted to go to war, he wouldn't have to make up any evidence of WMDs, because the evidence that they were there was so strong!!! ""One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line"" -President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998 ""I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force -- if necessary -- to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security."" - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002 ""Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime ... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation ... And now he is miscalculating America's response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction ... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real..."" - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan. 23. 2003","impeachment-president-open-letter-house-judiciary-committee","04:58 PM","government-debates","24"
