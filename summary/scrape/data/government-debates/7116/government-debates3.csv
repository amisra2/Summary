That's right conservatives believe if the constitution is in the way just ignore it. Unless it is a moral issue then the constitution is to be read word for word with no interprataion or devaition.","impeachment-president-open-letter-house-judiciary-committee","08:36 PM","government-debates","31"

It is quite funny that all you want to do is impeach the president and not look at the matter at hand. He spied on terrorists, the same ones who brought down the Trade Towers, and part of the pentagon. Once again, they are terrorists, they've earned it.","impeachment-president-open-letter-house-judiciary-committee","03:45 PM","government-debates","33"

Not even Bush is claiming they are. They're American citizens who someone thinks may have ""links"" to people who are probably terrorists. And, despite your claims, terrorists do have the same rights as any other person with the same nationality that they have. Rights apply to everyone, even the evil. Frustrating sometimes, but none the less true.","impeachment-president-open-letter-house-judiciary-committee","06:17 PM","government-debates","34"

With all the publicity on this issue, any terrorist must be laughing his/her XXX off to think we believe they're stupid enough to use conventional communication to formulate plots.","impeachment-president-open-letter-house-judiciary-committee","07:28 PM","government-debates","35"

Maybe he has not traveled enough in the ME and the third world to realize that in most places, people use pay as you go cell phones. The phone and 2 hours of talk time costs you about $30 (us). There is no registration or contract. They are untracable. Many (most) criminals buy the phone and 4-5 hours of talk time, then throw the phone away and buy a new one. There is an adage I always heard around the shop before I sold my company. The guys used to say ""If you can't find anything prouctive to do, at least LOOK busy"". IMO this is what Bush is doing. He has realized that despite our billions in surveilance technology, and our intrusive internet monitoring programs, technology and encryption have reached the point that most communication is closed to us. We have rediculous laws abotu ""exporting"" encryption, while the best encryption technology anymore is coming out if India, Ireland, and S Korea.","impeachment-president-open-letter-house-judiciary-committee","10:28 PM","government-debates","36"

The people from the government came in while they were praying. They searched the trash cans, read all his email, copied his address book, then DELETED it. They said they did it because he was on the terrorist watch list. Unless you can prove they are terrorists, they are American citizens. If we know they're terrorists why are we wasting time spying on them? Arrest them and throw them in jail. Of course the problem is that most people on the watch list aren't terrorists. The FBI is complaining about all the people they have to go through. They said most phone conversations have been ordering piazza or something. And about the UNREASONABLE thing. I think wiretapping qualifies as unreasonable. Reasonable would be, I see a gun sticking out of your bag, I search the rest of your bag.","impeachment-president-open-letter-house-judiciary-committee","01:13 AM","government-debates","37"
