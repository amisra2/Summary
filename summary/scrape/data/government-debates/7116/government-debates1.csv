But after long consideration I am writing to you, our Representatives in Congress, with the conviction that it is time to call for impeachment of the President. By my observation we are at a critical juncture in the current state of affairs. So I feel I would be negligent to not speak up. As I understand the demands of time that your post commands, I will keep this brief. Though I am just one individual I respectfully beg your consideration. It is my concern the President has abused the position entrusted him and has acted in a manner treasonable to the United States and has violated his oath of office. By report he has stated the Constitution is only a ######ned piece of paper. By his actions he has demonstrated this truly is his belief. From the moment of hearing the terrible news of the attacks on the morning of September 11th I have felt a conviction that the exact identities behind it, and the true purpose for it have not truly been located. From that day forward there have progressed a steady series of violations of the Constitution, The Bill of Rights, State and Federal Laws, and the blueprints for the very rearrangement of the very checks and balances between Executive, Judicial and Legislative Branches. These alarm me. Most alarming are the profusion of Executive Orders which lay out the actions to be taken on such occasion as the declaring of a state of Emergency orders and or Martial Law. By these our President has taken on the color of an autonomous King, or petty Dictator, regarding himself as answering to none. It is my understanding that a proceeding toward impeachment may be initiated by Representatives and The House Judiciary Committee. And so I write to you in the sincere hope you will find, upon on your own inspection of the feelings and desires of your other constituents, a like dissatisfaction at the disregard for our very rights and freedoms under the waving of a fatuous Bogey Man of terrorism. I doubt that I am alone in this opinion. I thank you for your time in regarding this matter. Most Sincerely Yours, Penman Shipp","impeachment-president-open-letter-house-judiciary-committee","05:06 PM","government-debates","1"

In other words, broken the law. Bush has broken federal wire tapping laws, and has declared his intent to continue to do so. He's more than qualified for impeachment.","impeachment-president-open-letter-house-judiciary-committee","10:11 AM","government-debates","3"
"12-21-2005","7116",1,"emclean","None","that aint what his layers will say, and it would take a court, and 12 peers to decide if what he did is. remember innocent till proven guilty? (OK i guess it would be a grand jury to decide if there is enough evedance of illegal activities to charge)","Kronus","187015","It takes a jury for the government to declare someone guilty. When Bush gets on national TV and says ""I did it, and I'll do it again!"" I feel justified in reaching my own conclusions. As for his lawyers, he should probably keep them away from the media. When the best they can come up with is ""Legal? Yeah, um, the constitution says it's ok"" and they can't even back that up, it really doesn't help the public perception of his case. Lots of law and precedent says what he did is illegal, I haven't heard a single citation from them to contradict that. Just alot of vague hand waving.","impeachment-president-open-letter-house-judiciary-committee","10:55 AM","government-debates","5"
