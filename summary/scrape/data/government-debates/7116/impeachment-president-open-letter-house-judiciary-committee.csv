"12-19-2005","7116",1,"None","None","None","Penman Shipp","186524","Monday, December 19, 2005 An Open Letter to the Honorable Representatives of the United States House Judiciary Committee Dear Sirs & Madames, Congressmen: Although I am now 49 I have, to now, never been one to write letters to Editors, the Congress or the Senate. But after long consideration I am writing to you, our Representatives in Congress, with the conviction that it is time to call for impeachment of the President. By my observation we are at a critical juncture in the current state of affairs. So I feel I would be negligent to not speak up. As I understand the demands of time that your post commands, I will keep this brief. Though I am just one individual I respectfully beg your consideration. It is my concern the President has abused the position entrusted him and has acted in a manner treasonable to the United States and has violated his oath of office. By report he has stated the Constitution is only a ######ned piece of paper. By his actions he has demonstrated this truly is his belief. From the moment of hearing the terrible news of the attacks on the morning of September 11th I have felt a conviction that the exact identities behind it, and the true purpose for it have not truly been located. From that day forward there have progressed a steady series of violations of the Constitution, The Bill of Rights, State and Federal Laws, and the blueprints for the very rearrangement of the very checks and balances between Executive, Judicial and Legislative Branches. These alarm me. Most alarming are the profusion of Executive Orders which lay out the actions to be taken on such occasion as the declaring of a state of Emergency orders and or Martial Law. By these our President has taken on the color of an autonomous King, or petty Dictator, regarding himself as answering to none. It is my understanding that a proceeding toward impeachment may be initiated by Representatives and The House Judiciary Committee. And so I write to you in the sincere hope you will find, upon on your own inspection of the feelings and desires of your other constituents, a like dissatisfaction at the disregard for our very rights and freedoms under the waving of a fatuous Bogey Man of terrorism. I doubt that I am alone in this opinion. I thank you for your time in regarding this matter. Most Sincerely Yours, Penman Shipp","impeachment-president-open-letter-house-judiciary-committee","05:06 PM","government-debates","1"

When the best they can come up with is ""Legal? Yeah, um, the constitution says it's ok"" and they can't even back that up, it really doesn't help the public perception of his case. Lots of law and precedent says what he did is illegal, I haven't heard a single citation from them to contradict that.

Isn't it possible that he made a mistake? If anyone should be blamed for leading us into war, it's the CIA. There is no proof or even a little bit of evidence that suggests that Bush tried to manipulate the CIA into saying that there were WMDs. Because, I mean even if Bush wanted to go to war, he wouldn't have to make up any evidence of WMDs, because the evidence that they were there was so strong!!! ""One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line"" -President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998 ""I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force -- if necessary -- to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security."" - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002 ""Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime ... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation ... And now he is miscalculating America's response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction ... So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real..."" - Sen. John F.

There is an adage I always heard around the shop before I sold my company. The guys used to say ""If you can't find anything prouctive to do, at least LOOK busy"". IMO this is what Bush is doing. He has realized that despite our billions in surveilance technology, and our intrusive internet monitoring programs, technology and encryption have reached the point that most communication is closed to us.

They said they did it because he was on the terrorist watch list. Unless you can prove they are terrorists, they are American citizens. If we know they're terrorists why are we wasting time spying on them? Arrest them and throw them in jail. Of course the problem is that most people on the watch list aren't terrorists.
