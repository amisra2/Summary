I doubt anything I could say would show how ridiculous it is, but I'll try. IIRC, you're a manager at a fast food joint. Let's say for example that a law has been passed that everything on your menu must be sold for a maximum of $0.50. All portion sizes, quality of ingredients, etc... must remain exactly as is. Who do you think should make up the shortfall between your income and your expenses? Just how long do you think you'd have a job? Waxy","michigan-gas-amendment","05:09 PM","government-debates","5"

If we had other options to use as fuel or if there were other means of transportation then your analogy would be appropriate. Fast food is not a requirement as you can still go to the grocery store or cook and grow your own food. You can not go to the store and buy or drill for oil or refine it into gasoline at home. We regulate naturalgas, and electricity gasoline is no different.","michigan-gas-amendment","05:27 PM","government-debates","6"

Notice the two sticks of meat that are protruding from your body? These are called ""legs"" and can be used to move oneself around, either by walking or riding a bicycle. It's a mode of transport that requires no gasoline and as a nice side effect it helps people to get rid of their fat asses. Walking or riding a bicycle to work is quite normal in many parts of the world. What you are advocating is not democracy but communism (i.e. everybody has a ""right"" to everything). And making the average schmuck vote on the price of gasoline is a really bad idea, because I can guarantee you that they will want gasoline to cost 1 cent or less per gallon. Oh and while you're at it, why not put forth an amendment that gives all the people a free house, free clothing and free food. After all, these are basic necessities and everybody has a ""right"" to that, right?","michigan-gas-amendment","06:30 PM","government-debates","8"

Don't let steeeeve and the other conservative posters hear that.

As far as the cheap gas issue is concerned, have you ever thought about the fact that if you offer an item below the cost price it has to be subsidized? Considering the fact that the US government already spends way more than it takes in, this means that they have to print extra money to pay for the gas subsidizing scheme. This in turn leads to higher inflation. And guess who gets hit the hardest by higher inflation? That's right, poor people. So your brilliant plan basically comes down to poor people paying the most for everybody elses cheap gas. What a great plan....","michigan-gas-amendment","08:35 AM","government-debates","12"
"05-15-2007","9887",1,"None","None","None","E Mutz","263170","Michigan presently has one of the highest tax rates on Gasoline in the Nation. For every gallon of gas ye purchase $.352 goes to the gubment. Add the federal excise tax of $18.4 cents per gallon, the Michigan $.00875 per gallon environmental fee and, the $.18 cent/gallon state sales tax, and ye are paying jes about $.73/gallon in tax alone at a gas price of $3.00/gallon. Now ponder that for just a second. The gubment nets $.72, or 24% profit on each gallon of gas. What is the profit per gallon for the greedy oil companies? Approximately $.10/gallon after crude oil, refining, marketing and distribution costs. Queen Nans solution to the problem of high gas prices? Add another tax! The windfall profits tax. Do ye suppose the oil companies will just absorb this or perhaps pass it along to the consumer? Queen Nan gets the windfall tax approved, the price of gas goes up accordingly, the State of Michigan nets additional profit off its sales tax, and ye gripe all the more about the gouging. Oh, but we have not gotten into the costs associated with boutique fuels mandated by the Federal and State gubments! Fuel additives such as Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MtBE) must be mixed for a cost. MtBE, while beneficial for the air, absolutely pummels the groundwater if spilled. MtBE just soars through the substrate wreaking havoc in accordance with the laws of unintended consequence. Ethanol, that darling little fuel, cannot be transported though traditional pipelines. It must be transported via truck. Guess how much that costs? Ye want cheaper gas? Open ANWR in Alaska. Open the Gulf to exploration. Expand our refinery capacity in the US. Support infrastructure improvements in pipelines. Eliminate state-specific boutique fuels. Finally, buy stock in Exxon, BP, Royal Dutch Shell etc. Their profits become your profits.

What if people got to vote for cheaper Ferrari's or free iPods? Would that make it ""democratic"" (or morally right for that matter)? Gasoline is a commodity that is the property of the people or companies that refined it. Saying that you have a right to it just because you and some other folks (i.e the hysterical mob) decided on your own by ""voting"" that it belongs to you is just dispicable. This is no different than rioters looting a store and saying that the contents of the store rightfully belongs to them because the majority said so. Democracy = mob rule If 51% of the people said that extermination of gays should be legalised, would that be ok?","michigan-gas-amendment","10:52 AM","government-debates","15"
