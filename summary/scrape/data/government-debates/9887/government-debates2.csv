Matthew is desperately trying to make a point, but it's so absurd I can't bring myself to actually acknowledge it. As for the actual OP of the thread, we've been around this bush before - http://www.4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=6309 Waxy","michigan-gas-amendment","12:00 PM","government-debates","17"

We are not limited in voting for only good ideas...if we were then we'd have about half the laws we have now and probably would still have half of those be terrible. It seems obvious that if Michigan did an amendment like this then you'd see lots of healthy Michigan citizens as they would all be walking everywhere. The law would last about 5hrs before people freaked out and changed it. This is, of course, assuming everything flies with the constitution (and it probably could). I'm going to assume this post was to see if some of us are consistent on voting for whatever (and we are) and not to propose a good idea because it would be one of the dumbest ideas someone has ever proposed.","michigan-gas-amendment","01:49 PM","government-debates","18"

To lessen the impact upon the working families of the state of Michigan; Gasoline may not be sold for more then $1.50 per gallon. Any service station selling gasoline must continue to sell gasoline. All gasoline must continue to meet inspections and current regulations. Any price increase must be put to a popular vote.","jim's trucking","263234","Food, clothing, shelter and medical attention are necessities for working families. To lessen the impact upon the working families of the State of Michigan, all prices for the above shall be fixed at 1980 figures. Anyone selling these items must continue to sell at the same price whether their acquisition prices rise or not, whether they go bankrupt or not. All food, clothing, shelter and medical care shall remain the same quality. This is a bit more ridiculous than the OP...just a bit! Gasoline pricing follows the rules of supply and demand, just like most consumables.","michigan-gas-amendment","03:05 PM","government-debates","19"

It is unfair for some employees to gouge employers with excessive salary demands and rising benefit costs while returning no increased net benefit to the employer.
