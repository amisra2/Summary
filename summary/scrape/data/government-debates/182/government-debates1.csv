"02-10-2003","182",1,"None","None","None","Stormin Norman","1591","I would like to call attention to a disturbing idea being thrown around by liberals. They are proposing a further erosion of the U.S.-Mexico border, even greater than the porous border they are responsible for today. Their aim, the complete destruction of U.S. sovereignty, a world tax, and less freedom for all. Read this article and then tell me that liberalism represents a benign threat. http://www.newsmax.com/archives/arti...2/174255.shtml I couldn't get the original Economist article, because it was still prime material and they wanted me to pay. ------------------------------------------------------------------ Just to be fair, I will now proceed in my attack on those who aim to weaken America with an influx of immigrants by going after those 'undocumented' aliens of my own heritage. Illegal immigrants are a danger no matter what color of skin. The Irish are also flooding our country without going through the proper channels. It appears that our laws are not worth the paper they are printed on. Perhaps U.S. citizens should ignore them too. Clearly, it does not matter what the country of origin. Our immigration policy is irresponsible. People are allowed access to this nation's wealth without proper health checks, security sceening, or general common sense. Hey, look everyone, I made it to America! Oli-oli-oxen-free! ------------------------------------------------------------------- Is this illogical degradation of my nation's borders a communist plot masked by a concept that no one dare dispute? Is tolerance the greatest hate crime imaginable? Of course, everyone who remains soft on the border is not a communist, but hardcore leftists see tolerance as a weapon capable of destroying the great U.S.. Middle of the road common citizens have been fooled into thinking that it is our duty to give anyone and everyone safe passage across the border, and then extend freedom of movement through out our country, with no supervision. Most people view this as compassion for their fellow man who has suffered at the hands of tyrants. This flaw has allowed those same tyrants and miscellaneous enemies of the United States ample opportunity to slowly invade and infiltrate our system. They realize that the only feasible way to bring down their enemy is to insert them into a culture that believes in the protection of their rights. Only from within can they pound away at the infrastructure they aim to dismantle. The end goal of this ellaborate plot is a violent civil war they hope will end with the destruction of the capitalist system they hate. Our devastation will be derived from our own suicidal policies rooted in compassion and good will. We will feed and cloth our enemies. We will offer them protection under the best judicial system in the world. We will give them the microphone necessary for voicing their cause. We are our own enemies. If you are not convinced that we are giving aid and comfort to our own enemies right here in the U.S., read the following outline for the destruction of the U.S. drafted by Revolutionary Workers Online. This is a group that agrees with my assertions, only they represent the enemy. I give you a balanced look on the two underpinning sides of this issue. Like many things in life, it boils down to conservative vs. liberal, good against evil, man vs. man. My views represent the opposition to a violent unjust war against liberty and democracy. Their views so accurately depict the very corruption that was described ealier. I will allow you to read the following message espoused by a communist organization. It follows: "" Policy Towards Borders For the class-conscious proletariat, there is nothing sacred about the existing territory and borders of the U.S., which were carved out through mass murder and wholesale robbery by the ruling class. The proletariat within the U.S. will strive to liberate as much of that territory as possible, while encouraging and assisting revolution in other parts of North America and in Mexico in particular. Ultimately new borders will be established. Their location and character will depend on several factors, but most essentially on the development and outcome of the revolutionary struggles on the continent, on the need to defend the rule of the proletariat wherever it has been established, and, above all, on what most serves the further advance of the proletarian revolution, not only in this particular part of the world but in the world as a whole. The current border between the U.S. and Mexico is a two-thousand-mile bloody scar gouged out by Yankee imperialism. Today, from one side, this border is like a sieve, allowing U.S. capital to flow freely into Mexico, exploiting its people and resources and wreaking havoc with its air, water and, above all, the lives of its people. From the other side, this border is a militarized zone, criminalizing and terrorizing those coming north in a desperate search to find work and feed their families and/or fleeing bloody repression. The revolutionary struggles in the U.S. and Mexico will be closely intertwined, as people north and south of the current border strive to defeat our common enemy. Advances in each country will spur forward the struggle in the other, at times spilling over the border, pounding at a crucial faultline and potential great vulnerability of U.S. imperialismits close interconnection with Mexico in a relation of imperialist domination and oppression. All this will greatly strengthen the revolutionary struggle overall. It is this struggle that will determine the final shape, location, and character of the U.S.-Mexico border. But under no circumstances will this border be what it is today: a fortification of privilege of one nation over another"" From: http://rwor.org/home-e.htm Although this organization lacks credibility, they clearly demonstrate the motive for skewing the borders of the America. Some liberals are ignorant to this type of thinking, others are the perpetrators of this agenda. Whatever the reason for supporting the degradation the results will be the same. That is the destruction of the U.S.. Things will not turn out as smoothly as depicted by the rabid communists who wrote the previous account. The 'sleeping giant' is once again awakening to the horrors that the enemies of freedom present. Those like me are justified in killing to protect its future. When the survival of my ideals remain threatened, I will not care how the liberals view my use of force to quell a definite threat.","further-erosion-our-borders","06:07 AM","government-debates","1"

If our government was serious about closing the border, a simple razor wire fence on the Mexican border with a 100 yard deep minefield would do it. Cheap, easy, and quick, but the political and humanitarian fallout would be high. Before I get flamed for this. I DON""T WANT TO PUT IN MINEFIELDS. But other solutions not as cheap and easy will do the trick. The political resolve just does not exist to do it. There is something funny going on with our borders.","further-erosion-our-borders","11:10 PM","government-debates","2"

If this country was really serious about 1) closing the borders 2) selecting who enters the country then something other than buying a few blimps to take pictures would be done. Again blanket legalization is a two faced and spineless policy. ""Stay out, but if you get it you can stay"". Isn't that the message of blanket legalization? Does this not violate the principle of being able to pick and choose who enters the country? The minefield and razor wire would be the lowest cost and easiest way to seal the border. The political cost should be weighted with the dollar cost. I do not have any argument against a minefield other than the political cost. You can thank all the namby pamby spinelss liberals for that.","further-erosion-our-borders","09:12 AM","government-debates","5"

This wouldn't really be so bad if it wasn't beginning to ruin the economy of parts of the US where illegals like to settle such as California. California has also been affected politically which has emphasized the problem with illegals coming to this country. Grey Davis is actually helping them get closer to being able to have the right to vote! How is that for blanket legalization without any formalities at all? Cross the border into California and you get a drivers license and the right to vote! Mexico would inherit California within a few generations, not that it would be worth it based on the way California is going. Station the national guard on the border, give the order to kill all who try to cross the border, set up mine fields and barb wired fences, and make sure that anyone who does cross and is caught is sent to Guantanamo Bay for a few weeks before they are sent back to Mexico. I think this would do the trick. If you are referring to my idea of blanket legalization then you got one thing wrong. I support legalizing all the illegals who are here right now. No more after that. We have an unknown amount of illegals here today ranging between 5 to 10 million. These people have jobs in our economy and companies depend on them. Trying to remove them all would not only cost our government a great deal of money but also cost private companies money and cause more chaos in our economic system. Also it would unite the Hispanic community together as they would view this as a law which is focused on attacking them. Riots and terrorist activities could be the result of this. However, if we legalize them all then they have to begin paying taxes, they have to learn our laws as well as follow them, and they are going to be willing to support this issue. This would be a political game and political games such as this one needs support from the people. I know that I'd rather send all the illegals back to Mexico as well but more than that I think we need to close the border and do it as quickly as possible. I think a one time blanket legalization would draw enough support to get politician backing because the politicians will be backed by the people. After that one time there will be no more freebees, no more going soft on any illegal ever again. They will all be seen as the equivalent to a terrorist and will be treated as such. This is the way I think things should go. Politics kind of screws up what is right and wrong. Is it right that they are allowed to cross our borders right now? Absolutely not, but it is allowed because politicians fear the repercussions of doing something about it. With the Hispanic voice growing larger and larger will this country eventually be run by the minorities therefore helping the Democratic party? Yes it will, therefore the democrats will never support closing the border. Sorry if I can't just focus on doing what is right because I want this issue taken care of and I think Bush has maybe 5 more years in office to do it. He has to play politics if he wants to get it done before someone like Hillary Clinton gets into office. She will never do anything about it! Politically speaking I think it would be beneficial to just accept the illegals that are here today in order to gain support from the Hispanic community for closing the border for good and really toughening our stance on illegal immigration. Bush has the power to shut down this problem but he will have to play the hypocritical political game if he wants to succeed. Note: I'm generalizing when I use the word liberal here. The liberal stance on the border just turns my stomach. Of course they don't want a mine field on the border. Not because someone could get hurt because they could use that as a way to redistribute the wealth. If some illegal crossing the border got hurt they would just tax the rich and give that money as well as US citizenship to the illegal as well as the illegals family and friends. Liberals want illegals to get into the country. They will pander to the illegals so that when the illegals get here they will support the liberal agenda. Liberal California may soon give illegals the right to vote and who do you think the illegals will vote for? The liberals of course! So why should the liberals care if the illegals did get across and destabilize our economy? They get political gain out of it. Now that is what I call weighting dollar cost against political cost! The conservatives are our only hope of ever fixing this problem and right now they have the numbers on their side. They can attack this problem right now if their leadership wasn't so shaky. The liberals are out to open our borders to everyone because it will work towards their political advantage. We need a leader and a plan that will prevent the liberals from trading the American economy and culture for votes. Bush has my full support in next years election if he takes a stand and closes the border!","further-erosion-our-borders","09:59 AM","government-debates","6"
