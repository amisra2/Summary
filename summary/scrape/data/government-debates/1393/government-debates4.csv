I certainly agree with not teaching religion in schools, but thats because religion embodies a lot of intolerance, and its something you need to personally decide on when you are mature enough. the thing is, when you have gays that come into a school teaching little children to dislike christians, how is that OK? wouldn't that just be replacing one form of discrimination for another?","under-god-out","09:54 PM","government-debates","47"
"12-18-2003","1393",4,"None","None","None","Parcum","28168","That's completely different, SilentPlanet. The Catholic School's Mission is to teach the faith- I suppose you could consider it brainwashing, but it's sort of an exaggerating. The duty of the teachers are to teach children one thing- if they say ""well this is what Catholic believe, but you guys have your own opinions"", no. They say ""this is the faith. Your only choices are with or without God"".","under-god-out","12:52 AM","government-debates","49"
"12-18-2003","1393",4,"unkerpaulie","None","charchuk, you have a habit of assuming I mean what I didnt say. Homosexuality is not illegal, religion is not illegal. both are a question of personal choice, and both should be treated the same as far as constitution goes. the purpose of the constitution is not to supress religion. the purpose of the constitution is to define a government neutral of discrimination and bias. yes, religion and state should be separate. but so should homosexuality and state, Santa Claus and state, and any other personal belief/lifestyle and state this is exactly what would happen. as far fetched to your imagination as it may seem, if society by large lobbied for public stonings, you'd be seeing public stonings I know what religion is. I said religion alone is inadequate for defining a neutral goverment. read what I wrote, not what you think I wrote","Charchuk","28197","Wrong on all accounts. Religion is illegal when it is endorsed by the State. And homosexuality is not a personal choice. No more so than being a heterosexual is. And you have to accept it as such. And the only way to do this is to keep the two completely separate. That is why the State shouldn't make any laws banning it or defining what marriage is either. Government has no business in the bedrooms of consenting persons. That is why you have the Constitution and Bill of rights to prevent the majority from oppressing the minority. The state is barred from imposing religious beliefs on others. The founding fathers felt that this was more important since they knew all too well what happens when church and state mix. Homosexuality is not a belief, it is biology.","under-god-out","07:14 AM","government-debates","50"

You can't teach sexuality. Either you are or you aren't. They've been teaching sex ed in schools for several decades now.","under-god-out","07:16 AM","government-debates","51"

You can't teach sexuality. All they are doing is showing how intolerant theists can be towards something they don't (won't) understand. How are they teaching little children to dislike christians? Does teaching about the crusades, the Inquistion, or the Burning Times also teach children to ""dislike"" christians as well? There really isn't all that much in Christian history to speak well of it to begin with. I'm surprised that more people stop being christians once they study all of its bloody and intolerant history.","under-god-out","07:20 AM","government-debates","52"

I'm not disagreeing with you. I even said I agree that the state and religion should be kept separate. followng a religion is your own personal choice, and the government should remain neutral on that at all times. being homosexual, hetrosexual or otherwise is also your personal choice, and the government should remain neutral on this as well. its the same thing I said before... ^ thats just being plain ignorant. wth does homosexuality have to do with biology??? if you said psychology I would have no problem with that, but biology?? are you serious?","under-god-out","09:25 AM","government-debates","53"

It is biology. http://www.geocities.com/southbeach/.../biobasis.html So, you're saying that you chose to be a heterosexual? Why would anyone choose to be gay?","under-god-out","09:42 AM","government-debates","55"
"12-18-2003","1393",4,"unkerpaulie","None","theists dont misunderstand homosexuality. they disagree with it I'm against barring any doctrine that teaches discrimination. that was my original statement. this is what Parcum said if you have gay parents coming to 4th graders and telling them that christians hate gays, it sounds to me that they are teaching children discrimination against christians. I think there should be no place for that kind of doctrine in public schools, just as much as religion shouldnt be part of public schools.","Charchuk","28215","Apparently you don't understand it. It is irrelevant if you agree or disagree with it since it is not a choice. Do you choose to breathe air? Do you choose who you love? No, you don't. Christianity teaches discrimination. Are they telling the children to hate Christians? Christianity has a long and ugly history. Telling people the truth is not discrimination. It is not ""doctrine"". You sound just as bad as those you keep going on about a non-existent gay agenda. The only agenda here is yours.","under-god-out","09:47 AM","government-debates","56"

Why would anyone choose to be gay?","unkerpaulie","28230","anyone can choose to be gay. I can choose to be gay at anytime, with no alteration to my biological composition. you can have 2 identical twins, one gay and one straight. and there are a number of reasons I can think of off the top of my head why someone would choose to be gay: social acceptance, peer approval, sexual access, rebellion, pure curiousity, and I could go on. how do you explain ex-convicts being gay after coming out of jail? did their right hand develop a few more ridges? did their SCN suddenly get bigger? here's an article on the subject... here's another (this one touches on the ""twin"" issue)... here's yet another ... linking biological characteristic to sexual preference has been elusive, to say the least. and there are probably more resources on the net that argues against homosexuality linked to biology than for it being gay is a choice","under-god-out","10:40 AM","government-debates","57"
