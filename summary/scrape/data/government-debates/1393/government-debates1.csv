I think the constitution states that Congress shall make now law abridging the feedom of religion or the establishment of a religion. I am not certain how having under God in the pledge violates those provisions. How do you see it? By the way, I love your tag line.","under-god-out","04:40 PM","government-debates","2"
"12-11-2003","1393",1,"SilentPoet","None","By establishing God you rule out atheism, agnosticism, and humanism. Also you don't exactly cooperate with buddhism or hinduism. God is typically ocnsiderd in America to be the Christian God rather than just a diety.","epaphras_faith","26929","My next question is: Do agnosticism and atheism and humanism count as religions? As for Buddhism or Hinduism, the argument could be made that God refers to them as well. Regardless of how it is ""typically considered"" that does not mean the definition would necessarily be the christian or jewish god.","under-god-out","05:53 PM","government-debates","4"
"12-11-2003","1393",1,"SilentPoet","None",". Because theism is not a religion would it be ok for the alleigance to read, ""under no god""","epaphras_faith","26934","You make a good point there. I think I will have to take a different tac on my arguments. As I said, I didn't have a real good argument to begin with. I will be back on this one though.","under-god-out","06:07 PM","government-debates","6"

Yes, keep God in there. I hate it how people get so offensive when ""God"" is mentioned.","under-god-out","06:31 PM","government-debates","8"

It was put in there during the Cold War to let the Russian's know we are a moral people who abide by our Christian laws. It has nothing to do with us being a chosen nation by the Christian God. It is about our heritage and our way of life. Regardless as to whether you believe in God or not you should recognize that as a whole we are a Christian nation and are founded on the principles of Christianity hence ""under God"". That is just my opinion of this matter.","under-god-out","07:13 PM","government-debates","12"
"12-11-2003","1393",1,"None","None","None","lurch","27027","Actually, there is a difference between being a christian nation and being a nation of christians. We are not the first, but we may be the second. It is interesting how so many christians claim that this country was founded on christian principles. If that were so, wouldn't it be logical to expect that Christ would be mentioned in at least some document from the founding of our country? Guess what. And with just a little bit of investigation you will find that the Declaration of Independence is recognized as an example of humanist philosophy. Many, if not most, of the founding fathers were deists (and humanists) rather than theists, and they certainly weren't christians. None of the first 6 Presidents were christians. Washington was a deist, Adams was a Unitarian, Jefferson was a deist and late in life a Unitarian, Madison was a deist, Monroe was probably a deist - maybe atheist, and J Q Adams was Unitarian. The best estimates of the population of the Unitates States at the time of the Revolutionary was are that between 5 to 15% were practicing christians, probably somewhere around 8% is realistic. More may have been nominally members of some christian church, but that was only because most states had established state religions. So, should ""under God"" be removed from the Pledge? Personally, I don't care. It is a piddly little thing but it is important to christians for some reason. Even though they were told by Jesus to pray in private, that seems to mean to make fundamentalist christianity a part of government in any way possible. If christian prayer imposed by government had not been so pervasive and offensive over the years, one little semi-religious token probably wouldn't have been important. But first there were efforts to teach religion in science classes that was defeated, then came Bible reading as a required part of public education, and then prayers in public schools, and prayers at graduation and at football games. And christians were screaming and whining about how their rights were being denied the whole time. 1st graders who don't want to say christian prayers could just not listen. Christians have pushed their religion down everyone's throat for so long that there has been a back lash and an unwillingness to allow even a hint of religion in the government. I think there are more important cases of the religious right using the government to impose fundamentalist christianity on everyone than a semi-religious, semi-patriotic ritual. For example, our Attorney General holds prayer meetings every morning. He claims that they are not mandatory but no one who wanted to keep his job has tested that claim. Faith based initiatives are administered by organizations that are allowed to discriminate in hiring based on religion, even though it is unconstitutional. The first organization to receive money from Bushes faith initiative was successfully sued for religious descrimination and lost the federal funding. You might be interested to know that there were three christian schools in the 10 member football conference of my high school (I also taught at that school). At football games, none of them said prayers over the PA. They played the National Anthem and got on with the game. That was in Montana - a very conservative state. I also taught in Massachusetts and prayers were never recited before football games there either. I was stunned the first time I heard a christian prayer recited at a public school football game. However, I digress. Back to the ""christian nation"" bit. If this is a ""christian nation"", why is there no mention of Christ in the Constitution? Not only is Christ not mentioned, God isn't mentioned either. And religion is mentioned only as three prohibitions against it. Article VI says that ""...no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States."" And the 1st Amendment has two clauses pertaining to religion: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."" It should be noted that even though the religious freedom clauses of the 1st Amendment state restrictions against Congress only, the Supreme Court had found that this is a recognition of an individual right of each citizen, and a violation of either clause by any level of government, down to school districts, is a violation of the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. Thus, public school policies may not endorse nor support an establishment of religion - that means no christian prayers. If you want quick and handy test to decide if an action of government violates the 1st Amendment, here it is. This is the Lemon Test , defined by the Supreme Court in Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U. S. 602 (1971). If a law or government fails on any of the three tests, it is probably unconstitutional. 1) The government action must have a secular purpose. 2) The primary effect may not be to advance religion. 3) The government action must not foster excessive governmental entanglement with religion. Now consider the Pledge: Does the inclusion of ""under God"" have a secular purpose? Even though the Pledge itself may be a sem-patriotic ritual, that phrase has no secular purpose. (read the history of the Pledge) Is the primary effect to advance religion? Most certainly. Those who claim that this is a ""christian nation"" as justification make that clear. Does it entangle the government with religion? When every teacher in every classroom in every school district in every state recites it every day, it does. Those who don't see a problem with this, consider this hypothetical. Suppose that you have a small child that you send off to school. At the end of the first day your little dear tells you how the teacher is teaching the class a prayer. Do you think it is a good idea? Be honest. At the end of the week your little dear is ready to recite the prayer for you. Here is the beginning. ""Allah is the greatest. There is no God but Allah."" Is it such a good idea now?","under-god-out","10:00 PM","government-debates","13"

No is putting 'Under God' in our plege doing this, I don't think so, so technically its kind of like our country as a whole is breaking the law. Plus doesn't anyone feel like we are singling out people who belong to religions that don't follow one single God, or the God that most of us follow. It would settle the whole thing don't you think? I mean really The U.S.A. really isn't 'under God' so why keep it in.","under-god-out","10:23 PM","government-debates","14"
