"12-12-2003","1393",2,"None","None","None","Charchuk","27092","The pledge should be returned to its original content and meaning. In 1954, Congress after a campaign by the Knights of Columbus, added the words, 'under God,' to the Pledge. The Pledge was now both a patriotic oath and a public prayer . That last part is why adding 'Under God' makes it unconstitutional. http://history.vineyard.net//pledge.htm","under-god-out","11:03 AM","government-debates","17"

Secondly how does that establish an official religion? Removing it would discriminate against those that believe in God.","under-god-out","11:37 AM","government-debates","18"
"12-12-2003","1393",2,"Crim","None","It establishes theism. In this context, almost definitely Judeo-Christian theism. Removing it would result in neutrality, not discrimination against theists.","epaphras_faith","27098","How does it ESTABLISH it as an official religion? Please explain. Certainly it honors the concept of God. No doubt about that. But How does is actually establish a religion or prevent the free practice thereof? No one is forced to say the pledge by law.","under-god-out","12:33 PM","government-debates","20"

And leaving it in would discriminated against those who don't, and that is the point. In it with the unconstitutional addition of under god makes it that not only are you swearing to be loyal and protect your country, but you are also doing the same for your Christian god as well. That was why it had been added in the first place as an affirmation of god. The Christian god against the so-called godless commies. Anyone who disagreed with this at the time was labeled a traitor and their lives destroyed.","under-god-out","05:16 PM","government-debates","21"

He thought that the two should be kept separate as well.","under-god-out","05:17 PM","government-debates","22"

Wouldn't you feel like a second class citizen being force to pledge loyality to a god you don't believe in? Or even if you're an atheist (I know that Bush sr. says that they aren't real Americans.) but wouldn't you feel the same way? Try having empathy for those who don't believe as you do and see it from our point of view.","under-god-out","05:20 PM","government-debates","23"

They wanted to show the ""godless commies"" that the USA was a CHRISTIAN NATION. That is why they added it.","under-god-out","08:04 AM","government-debates","26"
"12-13-2003","1393",2,"SilentPoet","None","The existance of God as said in the pledge of alleigance does not apply to atheism, agnosticism, buddhism, or hinduism. Thus it is discriminating. If you, as I do, beleive the government should have neutral stance to religion then the solution is to make the pledge of alleigance reflect that by removing the words ""Under God""","Charchuk","27218","And this is exactly how the original author felt as well. It should be restored to its original intent. It has been perverted for far too long.","under-god-out","08:05 AM","government-debates","27"

It is in public schools where the problem araises. Religious schools don't have to follow proper standards.","under-god-out","03:14 PM","government-debates","30"
