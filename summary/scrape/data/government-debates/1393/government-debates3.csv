"12-17-2003","1393",3,"Parcum","None","Yes it happened. My 4th grade teacher was gay, and every year we had the annual ""gay pride parade"", where gay parents would talk to children in the class and explain that gays are normal and that Christians hate them and call them ""XXXXXXX"" and ""dikes"". This is partially the reason I was pulled out of the public school system.","Charchuk","27997","What? Your parents were afraid that you would be ""turned"" gay, or where they also afraid that you would hear too much of the truth as well?","under-god-out","07:07 AM","government-debates","35"

It has to do with the constitution and bill of rights. ""exposing children to homosexual practices in school.""? What, are they showing two gay men having sex or something? Homosexuality is not illegal. Imposing religion on children on State property is and has always been illegal. It is just that now people can say something about it instead of being told to shut up or else. No one is saying that you shouldn't ""accept"" god. Only that the State can't be the one imposing it for you. If the ""crowd"" wanted public stoning would it be ok to have it? Religion is religion, its meaning has not changed. Why should it? One's personal life is one's own business as long as it involves person's of the age of consent. Those people would be incrediblely wrong as well. There is nothing supernatural about the process itself. Maybe you should look up the meaning of religion again.","under-god-out","07:05 PM","government-debates","39"

Is it less right to discriminate against gays or more right to discriminate against christians? How is it more wrong to indoctrinate children with dislike towards christians? should children be taught to tolerate christianity? how is exposing children to homosexuality in schools better or worse than exposing children to religion in schools?","under-god-out","09:34 PM","government-debates","44"

So what if you were raised in a Christian household? If you were raised in an atheist household, you would be atheist. Agnostic, you would be agnostic. This doesn't disprove Christianity.","under-god-out","09:41 PM","government-debates","45"
