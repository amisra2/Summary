You could go have sex with a guy, but you wouldn't like it.","unkerpaulie","28240","thats a pretty risky assumption. how do you account for all the bi-sexuals out there? besides, how could you even think you'd know whether somebody else will like something or not. I never knew I liked strawberry cheesecake til the day I tried it. then again, some people cant stand strawberry cheesecake, even though they tried to like it numerous times. then again some acquire a taste for cheesecake. then again some people grow to dislike cheesecake yes I am saying you can instantly change what you're attracted to. people are attracted to different things at different times for different reasons. trying to predict or formulate what people are going to like or dislike is practically impossible. likes and dislikes are completely subjective. as far as I know, all attempts to tie a scientific method to subjective choice have failed. thats the way humans are","under-god-out","11:57 AM","government-debates","61"

I can choose to be gay at anytime, with no alteration to my biological composition. you can have 2 identical twins, one gay and one straight. and there are a number of reasons I can think of off the top of my head why someone would choose to be gay: social acceptance, peer approval, sexual access, rebellion, pure curiousity, and I could go on. how do you explain ex-convicts being gay after coming out of jail? did their right hand develop a few more ridges? did their SCN suddenly get bigger? linking biological characteristic to sexual preference has been elusive, to say the least. and there are probably more resources on the net that argues against homosexuality linked to biology than for it being gay is a choice","Charchuk","28248","That is one of the funniest things I've heard yet. No, you can't choose to be gay. Why would you choose to be gay? And you'd still be wrong. Many of those things have nothing to do with homosexuality in the least. You mistakenly belief that being gay is only about the sex. It isn't. That is only a part of it. Even straight animals will sometime engage in such activity as a means of dominance. It doesn't mean that they're gay. That is something totally different. They aren't homosexual it is a matter of locking up men together who are use to having sexual release. Being gay has nothing to do with it. No, it isn't and only the ignorant would want to believe that. One can no more choose being gay than being black. The way gays are treated in this society one make one see that it isn't aa choice.","under-god-out","12:36 PM","government-debates","62"

He believes that homosexuality is just about the sex. It isn't.","under-god-out","12:37 PM","government-debates","63"
"12-18-2003","1393",5,"unkerpaulie","None","shall we redefine ""homosexuality"" too? dictionary.com's definition : homosexuality: Sexual orientation to persons of the same sex; Sexual activity with another of the same sex; a sexual attraction to (or sexual relations with) persons of the same sex seems to me from what this definition says, if you have sex with members of the same sex, thats homosexuality. please elaborate on the difference between homosexuality as defined above, and what you mean by ""being gay"" what does ""the way gays are treated in society"" have to do with whether its a choice or not? if your treated bad for doing something, then it wasnt your choice? if your treated good then it was your choice? what is the relation? and furthermore, how are gays treated in society? good? bad? how do you determine that?","Charchuk","28295","And heterosexual is the same except with the opposite sex.. Say you're married and your wife can't have sex at all. Would you still love her or would you go out and find a woman who can have sex? Only with members of the same sex and never with those of the opposite. You still think it is just about sex. It is much more than that. Go out dressed and act like you're gay and see what happens to you. I smell a troll. You couldn't be that clueless.","under-god-out","03:55 PM","government-debates","65"
