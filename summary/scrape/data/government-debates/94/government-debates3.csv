"02-01-2003","94",3,"None","None","None","Broker","504","I like a mix, leaning toward capitalism. I would also like to be a teacher, but I could never live on that salary. I plan to go into business, make my money, and if my career in politics doesn't take off, become a teacher...a history teacher. I love history! I'm not money hungry. I want to live better than I do now, and I'm prepared to do something to make that happen. Not all people are. And to those in other, less wealthy countries our poor are considered well off.","differences-between-socialism-communism","01:00 PM","government-debates","32"

At least half go to essentials, and then with two children and a wife... And I wouldn't want to enter the school system at this point. I can not work with those... children.

You basically advocate forced giving for people who have money. To me that just strikes too much of someone telling me what I must do against my will. To really achieve social justice, a major shift in how humans view the poor is needed. A major shift in the morality and ethical treatment of the poor in this country will achive your vision of social justice. Passing laws and government institutions do a very poor job of teaching ethics and morality to people. You are approaching the solution of poverty in this country from the wrong venue. When was the last time the IRS, BATF, or FAA gave a lesson on the ethical treatment of the poor? When governments does try to teach ethics and morality it then becomes social engineering that rates up there with the Nazis. When people finaly accept what the worlds religions have been teaching for thousands of years about care to the poor, will there finally be social justice, without socialism or government social engineering.","differences-between-socialism-communism","11:16 PM","government-debates","43"
