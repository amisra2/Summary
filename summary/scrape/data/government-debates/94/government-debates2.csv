Free speech is opressed because someone will always want to change the system. The only way socialist states support themselves is with very, very high taxes. The government takes enough from us already... that's why poverty rates are higher in many socialist countries...the goverment takes even more (Source: CIA Factbook, 2002). I understand that a lot of people are poor, but sometimes its their own fault. It's not our job to bail them out because they made a huge mistake. A good example is getting pregnant. A lot of girls have to jump out of school and leave their previous lives. They made the mistake, the did the stupid thing. I don't want to pay for it. Most rich people give a lot of their family fortunes away when they die. Bill Gates' will gives most of his money to charity, and he already has a $30 billion foundation. He leave enough for his children to live comfortable lives. I have no problem with that. He started the company, he bought most of the stock. The company didn't pay him billions, the stock soared. Good for him. He generated a lot of wealth and money that people and the government would not have. Carnegie and Rockefeller did something similar. Carnegie wrote that ""The man who dies rich dies disgraced."" Both of them gave billions of dollars in today's money away. Rich people can do what they want. They keep things moving. It's rich people who start most new companies... they have enough money to spare some.","differences-between-socialism-communism","06:46 PM","government-debates","16"

Falling has already said that he wants to avoid that debate in this forum. I don't think anyone would disagree that communism is worse than socialism. Would this be a correct assumption?","differences-between-socialism-communism","06:58 PM","government-debates","17"
"01-30-2003","94",2,"None","None","None","Broker","328","Bill Gates actually makes around $250,000 a year... the same most of the other executives of Microsoft make. I was looking into starting a business. I've planned for a long time and my projections tell me it would probably work. But the complicated tax code and high tax rates won't let that business off the ground... If that business were to succeed, I'll give myself a nice salary. I started the business. If the employees aren't happy with what I pay them thats too bad. Executives work very, very hard. They have to often take personal responsibility for what their company does. They've usually been the ones who planned the business or who went to college for four years to get their degree to run that business. It sort of boils down to intelligence and how lazy a person is. I'm trying to get into the IB Program so that I stand a good chance of not having to pay so much for my post-secondary education. My parents can't really help me with it. But you want to take even more from them so everyone can have healthcare. That is insane. Don't punish people too much for being successful. I would not mind paying a high tax rate if I was rich, but I don't want you taking more than half of my money. I made that money, not you. And that money you were supposed to spend educating me? Yeah, never saw it. Didn't go to me or the people in the class who will grow up to make 60% of the change. Reorganize your priorities. You aren't going to help me so much, but if I become successful you'll want my money. My science teacher had a gifted program when he was in 1st grade. Out of around 18 people, 11 went on to get doctorates. One is the chief Chinese translator for the UN. Now look at them! Look at what they did! But Uncle Sam didn't spend any more money on them...those other six may have gone on to be just as successful.","differences-between-socialism-communism","07:02 PM","government-debates","18"

Christ taught us to show mercy on those who have sinned (actually we all have sinned). try to be more like Christ, and you will find yourself to be a much more friendly, compassionate, and loving person.","differences-between-socialism-communism","12:35 AM","government-debates","20"

"01-31-2003","94",2,"None","None","None","Cool Hand Dave","387","I haven't really payed much attention to this whole debate. Honestly I've only read the last few posts, but since I see some stuff about salaries and classes and such I figure I'll throw my two cents worth in. It's true, business execs earn $200,000; some much more, some less. But what about the folks who built the office building, for example. My bet goes that they work slightly harder than any business exec. I'd say that job is more physically and mentally demanding in its own respect. Take teachers for another example. We all know they are underpaid for the work they do. Business execs as well as street sweepers keep this country running on a day to day basis, but for some reason only one of the two ends up struggling. Who really needs $200,000 a year to live? Its awesome to have nice things, but there are only so many nice things you can buy before it turns into obsession, or just plain and simple greed. Plus, i hope this doesn't offend anyone, but business execs aren't worth that much more than street sweepers, or janitors. Again, I don't know if that has anything to do with the current topic. That just seemed like the direction it was heading in.","differences-between-socialism-communism","10:22 AM","government-debates","22"

Just because business people make a lot of money doesn't mean that they don't work as hard as other people. People just have this preconceived idea of lazy fat business people sitting in comfortable leather chairs all day and bossing people around. Oh yeah, and as I have been already told off for, this isn't a debate about capitalism vs. socialism. It's about the ""differences between socialism and communism"".","differences-between-socialism-communism","02:19 PM","government-debates","23"

"01-31-2003","94",2,"None","None","None","Broker","446","How many years did those construction workers go to College? Teachers should make more money... Florida has this nice thing called a class size amendment. Now we will double our schools and teachers to comply and pay hundreds of billions of dollars to do it. Ugh... I'd love to see more go to teachers, but here in Florida the liberals pushed that through and those pay raises are impossible. That amendment passed by 1%. Most people didn't know how much it would cost, and that is the only reason why it passed. Business is not easy. As an executive you have to give your personal gurantee on financial statements or other important things. If something goes wrong you go to jail or pay huge penalties. You have to make the big decisions. That executive is usually the main strategist who is planning the company's entire future. That guy in the cubicle doesn't do that. Seems to me that when you have a good CEO the company turns up and makes much more and people get a 5% pay raise. Nothing is wrong with rewarding the guy who doubled revenues.","differences-between-socialism-communism","06:51 PM","government-debates","26"

I went broke to start my own business and now I am making enough money to live something like comfortable. Why should I pay your hospital bill with the money I worked my backside off to earn?

"01-31-2003","94",2,"None","None","None","Broker","454","Exactly! You use what you have left to try and get back off... the government doesn't help you. But if someone makes a stupid choice that they could easily have prevented the government rushes in to help them. It's not our fault that someone makes a stupid choice. So be it. Every great mistake has a halfway moment. They knew the risks. I'm probably not that compassionate. If I ever get rich I'll give a lot for charity. Raising my taxes to 85% is unacceptable. When I give to charity I know where the money goes. When I give to the government some of my money ends up being spent on cattle research or paying some SEC people more than the president. A business can set its pay as high as it wants... that money belongs to the company. The government needs to set limits because it isn't their money. I have my own plans to deal with the problems: 1. Create a progressive tax rate that takes no more than 50% of anyone's money. 2. Create a free healthcare plan for anyone at or below a certain income level. 3. Reform welfare and don't hesitate to cut benefits if someone is being lazy. 4. Raise excise taxes on tabacco and alcohol products, luxury cars, and many other goods. 5. Provide more money for people at or below a certain income level to go to college. Anyone can live the American dream. If someone's parents make stupid choices their kids don't have to. They can do well in school, go to a good college, and get a nice job.","differences-between-socialism-communism","08:14 PM","government-debates","28"
