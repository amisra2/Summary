"01-29-2003","94",1,"None","None","None","fallingupwards","179","i have been confused about the differences between the two. i have heard that communism gives money to the government and socialism gives money to the people. if this is the case, then i definitly favor socialism. i've also heard that communism favors in exact equality in the wealth of every citizen, while socialism works for a more equal distribution of wealth but not exactly equal. i do know that socialist countries have free health care and a lot of cool government programs. i also know that communist countries suppress many freedoms such as speech. socialism to me seems to be halfway between capitalism and communism. it takes the best of both worlds. it takes the idea of equal wealth from communism and the idea of freedoms such as speech from capitalism. but the main reason why i started this thread was to clear up my misunderstanding about the differences between the two. american, based on ur previous posts, i know that you probably despise socialism and love capitalism. so when you respond and tell me the differences between socialism and communism, just give me the facts not your personal opinion. i am not interested in a debate between capitalism and socialism, i am interested in a debate between socialism and communism. thank you.","differences-between-socialism-communism","12:34 AM","government-debates","5"

Okay, if you want to debate with facts then here they are: Socialism: 1 : any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods 2 a : a system of society or group living in which there is no private property b : a system or condition of society in which the means of production are owned and controlled by the state 3 : a stage of society in Marxist theory transitional between capitalism and communism and distinguished by unequal distribution of goods and pay according to work done. Communism: 1 a : a theory advocating elimination of private property b : a system in which goods are owned in common and are available to all as needed 2 capitalized a : a doctrine based on revolutionary Marxian socialism and Marxism-Leninism that was the official ideology of the U.S.S.R. b : a totalitarian system of government in which a single authoritarian party controls state-owned means of production c : a final stage of society in Marxist theory in which the state has withered away and economic goods are distributed equitably d : communist systems collectively Reference: www.m-w.com (mirriam webster dictionary) As you can see, socialism and communism are very similar. Both systems require citizens to work in state owned production plants where the products are then given to the government for ""equal distribution"".

Jesus clearly stated that the rich will not enter the kingdom of heaven if they do not share their wealth with the poor. he said ""it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven"". most rich people do not share their wealth, and as a result there is a huge unequal distribution of wealth. it is the government's responsibility to look after the people. therefore, the government must help the poor.","differences-between-socialism-communism","09:03 PM","government-debates","13"

I did not, and do not, look to start a debate about capitalism and socialism in this thread. I wanted to know what you defined communism and socialism to be so that I knew where we were headed. I will say that socialism is certainly better than communism. Look at the communist countries. The former USSR, Red China, former Germany, and others. None of them have a good record of immigration into thier countries, and all were known for their oppression of the people.

Free speech is opressed because someone will always want to change the system. The only way socialist states support themselves is with very, very high taxes. The government takes enough from us already... that's why poverty rates are higher in many socialist countries...the goverment takes even more (Source: CIA Factbook, 2002). I understand that a lot of people are poor, but sometimes its their own fault. It's not our job to bail them out because they made a huge mistake. A good example is getting pregnant. A lot of girls have to jump out of school and leave their previous lives. They made the mistake, the did the stupid thing. I don't want to pay for it. Most rich people give a lot of their family fortunes away when they die. Bill Gates' will gives most of his money to charity, and he already has a $30 billion foundation. He leave enough for his children to live comfortable lives. I have no problem with that. He started the company, he bought most of the stock. The company didn't pay him billions, the stock soared. Good for him. He generated a lot of wealth and money that people and the government would not have. Carnegie and Rockefeller did something similar. Carnegie wrote that ""The man who dies rich dies disgraced."" Both of them gave billions of dollars in today's money away. Rich people can do what they want. They keep things moving. It's rich people who start most new companies... they have enough money to spare some.","differences-between-socialism-communism","06:46 PM","government-debates","16"

"01-30-2003","94",2,"None","None","None","Broker","328","Bill Gates actually makes around $250,000 a year... the same most of the other executives of Microsoft make. I was looking into starting a business. I've planned for a long time and my projections tell me it would probably work. But the complicated tax code and high tax rates won't let that business off the ground... If that business were to succeed, I'll give myself a nice salary. I started the business. If the employees aren't happy with what I pay them thats too bad. Executives work very, very hard. They have to often take personal responsibility for what their company does. They've usually been the ones who planned the business or who went to college for four years to get their degree to run that business. It sort of boils down to intelligence and how lazy a person is. I'm trying to get into the IB Program so that I stand a good chance of not having to pay so much for my post-secondary education. My parents can't really help me with it. But you want to take even more from them so everyone can have healthcare. That is insane. Don't punish people too much for being successful. I would not mind paying a high tax rate if I was rich, but I don't want you taking more than half of my money. I made that money, not you. And that money you were supposed to spend educating me? Yeah, never saw it. Didn't go to me or the people in the class who will grow up to make 60% of the change. Reorganize your priorities. You aren't going to help me so much, but if I become successful you'll want my money. My science teacher had a gifted program when he was in 1st grade. Out of around 18 people, 11 went on to get doctorates. One is the chief Chinese translator for the UN. Now look at them! Look at what they did! But Uncle Sam didn't spend any more money on them...those other six may have gone on to be just as successful.","differences-between-socialism-communism","07:02 PM","government-debates","18"

Honestly I've only read the last few posts, but since I see some stuff about salaries and classes and such I figure I'll throw my two cents worth in. It's true, business execs earn $200,000; some much more, some less. But what about the folks who built the office building, for example. My bet goes that they work slightly harder than any business exec. I'd say that job is more physically and mentally demanding in its own respect. Take teachers for another example. We all know they are underpaid for the work they do. Business execs as well as street sweepers keep this country running on a day to day basis, but for some reason only one of the two ends up struggling. Who really needs $200,000 a year to live? Its awesome to have nice things, but there are only so many nice things you can buy before it turns into obsession, or just plain and simple greed. Plus, i hope this doesn't offend anyone, but business execs aren't worth that much more than street sweepers, or janitors. Again, I don't know if that has anything to do with the current topic.

Florida has this nice thing called a class size amendment. Now we will double our schools and teachers to comply and pay hundreds of billions of dollars to do it. Ugh... I'd love to see more go to teachers, but here in Florida the liberals pushed that through and those pay raises are impossible. That amendment passed by 1%. Most people didn't know how much it would cost, and that is the only reason why it passed. Business is not easy. As an executive you have to give your personal gurantee on financial statements or other important things. If something goes wrong you go to jail or pay huge penalties. You have to make the big decisions. That executive is usually the main strategist who is planning the company's entire future. That guy in the cubicle doesn't do that. Seems to me that when you have a good CEO the company turns up and makes much more and people get a 5% pay raise.

But if someone makes a stupid choice that they could easily have prevented the government rushes in to help them. It's not our fault that someone makes a stupid choice. So be it. Every great mistake has a halfway moment. They knew the risks. I'm probably not that compassionate. If I ever get rich I'll give a lot for charity. Raising my taxes to 85% is unacceptable. When I give to charity I know where the money goes. When I give to the government some of my money ends up being spent on cattle research or paying some SEC people more than the president. A business can set its pay as high as it wants... that money belongs to the company. The government needs to set limits because it isn't their money. I have my own plans to deal with the problems: 1. Create a progressive tax rate that takes no more than 50% of anyone's money. 2. Create a free healthcare plan for anyone at or below a certain income level. 3. Reform welfare and don't hesitate to cut benefits if someone is being lazy. 4. Raise excise taxes on tabacco and alcohol products, luxury cars, and many other goods. 5. Provide more money for people at or below a certain income level to go to college. Anyone can live the American dream. If someone's parents make stupid choices their kids don't have to.

A major shift in the morality and ethical treatment of the poor in this country will achive your vision of social justice. Passing laws and government institutions do a very poor job of teaching ethics and morality to people. You are approaching the solution of poverty in this country from the wrong venue.
