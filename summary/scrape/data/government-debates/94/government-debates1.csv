In the end they both do the same thing: take money away from the rich and give it to the poor, and make us all like robots.

"01-29-2003","94",1,"None","None","None","fallingupwards","179","i have been confused about the differences between the two. i have heard that communism gives money to the government and socialism gives money to the people. if this is the case, then i definitly favor socialism. i've also heard that communism favors in exact equality in the wealth of every citizen, while socialism works for a more equal distribution of wealth but not exactly equal. i do know that socialist countries have free health care and a lot of cool government programs. i also know that communist countries suppress many freedoms such as speech. socialism to me seems to be halfway between capitalism and communism. it takes the best of both worlds. it takes the idea of equal wealth from communism and the idea of freedoms such as speech from capitalism. but the main reason why i started this thread was to clear up my misunderstanding about the differences between the two. american, based on ur previous posts, i know that you probably despise socialism and love capitalism. so when you respond and tell me the differences between socialism and communism, just give me the facts not your personal opinion. i am not interested in a debate between capitalism and socialism, i am interested in a debate between socialism and communism. thank you.","differences-between-socialism-communism","12:34 AM","government-debates","5"
"01-29-2003","94",1,"None","None","None","Calligirl","218","fallingupwards: I have not been ""brainwashed"" as you say. Okay, if you want to debate with facts then here they are: Socialism: 1 : any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods 2 a : a system of society or group living in which there is no private property b : a system or condition of society in which the means of production are owned and controlled by the state 3 : a stage of society in Marxist theory transitional between capitalism and communism and distinguished by unequal distribution of goods and pay according to work done. Communism: 1 a : a theory advocating elimination of private property b : a system in which goods are owned in common and are available to all as needed 2 capitalized a : a doctrine based on revolutionary Marxian socialism and Marxism-Leninism that was the official ideology of the U.S.S.R. b : a totalitarian system of government in which a single authoritarian party controls state-owned means of production c : a final stage of society in Marxist theory in which the state has withered away and economic goods are distributed equitably d : communist systems collectively Reference: www.m-w.com (mirriam webster dictionary) As you can see, socialism and communism are very similar. Both systems require citizens to work in state owned production plants where the products are then given to the government for ""equal distribution"". Is that a good enough explanation for you?","differences-between-socialism-communism","04:08 PM","government-debates","6"
"01-29-2003","94",1,"None","None","None","fallingupwards","220","calli, i know the dictionary definition of the two terms. i am merely trying to have a discussion of the differences between the two. the american people have been trained to think that anything other than capitalism is evil. you have obviously fallen victim to this. capitalism gives all the money to the very rich. did you know that one percent of the american population holds 80% of the wealth? that means that for every dollar, one percent gets 80% and the other 99% have to split the 20 cents. that doesnt sound very fair to me. and dont give me that XXXX that those people earned it. are you trying to imply that only one percent of the united states works hard and the other 99% are lazy??","differences-between-socialism-communism","05:03 PM","government-debates","7"
"01-29-2003","94",1,"None","None","None","Calligirl","223","Guess who gives people jobs in the first place? Business owners! (a.k.a. ""rich people"") If they have more money, then they can hire more people. Less money for them means more layoffs for us. No I am not implying that the other 99% are lazy, I am implying that they can't get jobs unless the business owners (a.k.a. ""rich people"") have money to hire them in the first place!","differences-between-socialism-communism","05:25 PM","government-debates","8"
"01-29-2003","94",1,"None","None","None","fallingupwards","228","excuse me for believing that business owners should not make billions and billions of dollars. excuse me for having compassion for the poor. excuse me for following Christ's example by believing the rich should share their wealth with the less fortunate. i apologize","differences-between-socialism-communism","05:44 PM","government-debates","9"
"01-29-2003","94",1,"None","None","None","Calligirl","229","You're excused. Just because Christ told the rich to share their money with the less fortunate doesn't mean that the government has the right to force them to. Why shouldn't business owners make billions and billions of dollars? They earned it! More jobs for us!","differences-between-socialism-communism","05:53 PM","government-debates","10"
"01-29-2003","94",1,"None","None","None","fallingupwards","230","most rich people did not earn their billions of dollars. many of them inherit it. look at the Rockefellers for instance. they dont work hard. they got all their money passed down to them. look at George W. he's an idiot but he's rich because he inherited it from his father. please please please. enough with the ""they earned it"" XXXX. i have used this example countless of times before. i'm going to be a teacher after college. i'm going to be poor the rest of my life. are you trying to say that i'm not working hard???? if you are, then you are a very very ignorant person (even though i think you already are). i'm going to work just as hard (or probably harder) than those billionares but i'm going to be poor. in a socialist country, this would not be the case. we should tax the rich more and give their extra money to the WORKING class. Jesus Christ clearly said in the bible that the rich MUST give to the poor in order to be accepted into the kingdom of heaven. the problem is, MOST rich people do not give money to the poor, relative to how much they make.","differences-between-socialism-communism","06:05 PM","government-debates","11"
"01-29-2003","94",1,"None","None","None","fallingupwards","249","i'm going to be a teacher because i love history and thats what i want to do. so why should i be punished for it? why should i have to live in poverty for working just as hard as a billionare. i should be able to work hard at something and make a REAL contribution to society without being poor. a person should not become a billionare based on what their parents did. are you in favor of our government offices being passed down in peoples families? for example, should every president be in the Bush family? after all, the first one did earn it. you didnt answer my other comment. Jesus clearly stated that the rich will not enter the kingdom of heaven if they do not share their wealth with the poor. he said ""it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven"". most rich people do not share their wealth, and as a result there is a huge unequal distribution of wealth. it is the government's responsibility to look after the people. therefore, the government must help the poor.","differences-between-socialism-communism","09:03 PM","government-debates","13"

I did not, and do not, look to start a debate about capitalism and socialism in this thread. I wanted to know what you defined communism and socialism to be so that I knew where we were headed. I will say that socialism is certainly better than communism. Look at the communist countries. The former USSR, Red China, former Germany, and others. None of them have a good record of immigration into thier countries, and all were known for their oppression of the people. One of the best illustrations of what communism does to a nation is seen in the Stalin regime.","differences-between-socialism-communism","05:39 PM","government-debates","15"
