"02-22-2003","94",7,"None","None","None","Broker","2914","Somewhat agreed. I have no problem with some limited social welfare. Right now things are a mess because people are too compassionate. I want to reform welfare and welfare workers shouldn't be afraid to cut people off if they don't need it...and if they are they shouldn't have that job. I have no problem with giving healthcare to those who can't afford it. But this is not across the board. If you are not seeking work or to further your education and get a better job you can't get into any of my programs...","differences-between-socialism-communism","11:18 PM","government-debates","92"

I stay there for about ten years. Then I use that business position to launch my race to be governership of Florida. If that's successful I'll try and stay for two terms and use that to launch into the presidential race.","differences-between-socialism-communism","08:51 AM","government-debates","96"
