What happens if people don't measure up the governments yard stick of morality? Once you build a govenment institution, it is almost impossible to make it just go away. Build a socialist infastructure and all you get is bigger and bigger government. So after you achive the socialist government and finally build your long term goal of a libertarianism government, do you just say the country is now enlightened we don't need you any more? Your not going to convince the rich to share the wealth with more laws or institutions. Government and socialism is about control. Once they have it you don't get it back.","differences-between-socialism-communism","08:00 PM","government-debates","50"

"02-03-2003","94",4,"None","None","None","fallingupwards","787","then explain to me why most people who are born in poverty, remain in poverty their whole life?? or vice-versa?? i believe that human behavior is shaped by our environment. john locke called this the ""tabula rasa"" or ""blank tablet"". everything we learn comes through experience. therefore, if an entire generation grows up in a socialist and cooperative environment, they will naturally be cooperative. there will always be a couple greedy people out there, but they will be a small minority because everyone grew up in a cooperative environment. kelvin, suppose you are right when you say that the socialist government would be unwilling to give up their control. i would still take a socialist government over a capitalist government. and when i said that we would go from a socialist government to a libertarian government, i meant a gradual change probably covering a span of about 50 years. we are going through a gradual change as we speak, from capitalism to socialism. i wish the process would speed up, but nonetheless we are going through a gradual change.","differences-between-socialism-communism","09:37 PM","government-debates","52"

Because the only way the government is going to get away with high taxation is when they can take all the guns away from XXXXXX off people. Remember 1776 was all about taxes!
