You have already seen the result of a runway capitalist government with the Red Scare. If our own government could have gotten away with kiling the socialist and hiding thier bodies in a secret ditch it would have. Communism was runaway socialism. When you give the government more money, more authority, more power, that is exactly what it does, it becomes a 2000lb gorilla.","differences-between-socialism-communism","10:04 PM","government-debates","65"
