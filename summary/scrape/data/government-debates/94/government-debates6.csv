I don't know... models and model glue would I go to Target or The Hobby Shop?","differences-between-socialism-communism","07:32 PM","government-debates","76"
"02-07-2003","94",6,"None","None","None","fallingupwards","1320","many times, discount retailers sell the same products as smaller stores but they are at a cheaper price because a small business has to charge more in order to stay open. DISCOUNT RETAILERS TAKE BUSINESS AWAY FROM SHOPS. FACE THE FACTS, BROKER. one of about a trillion examples: there was a cool small guitar store back where i'm from that was doing very well and was thriving. but then, all of a sudden, Guitar Center (a monsterous guitar store based in Atlanta) moves in across the street. try to guess what happened? if you have a brain at all, you would guess that the small guitar shop was forced to close because everyone wanted to go to Guitar Center. walmart, target, home depot, lowes, harris teeter, etc etc etc are all taking customers away from small businesses. IT IS A FACT.","differences-between-socialism-communism","08:02 PM","government-debates","77"

I'm a bit surprised... you would prefer those small businesses to companies that give billions of dollars to charities?","differences-between-socialism-communism","08:23 PM","government-debates","78"

Keeping an unefficient business open is equal to saying we should be driving gas guzzling cars because there is someting worthy about inefficency. There are lots of small shops doing a very brisk business because a small shop can produce a custom quality product that a large business can not. One example furniture. You want average Joe furniture at a good price, go to Sam Levitz. Want a truly hand finished piece of Shaker furniture? You have to go to a craftsman making pieces one at a time. Both retailers are efficient in their own right and are worthy to be in business. Both could never compete with each other.","differences-between-socialism-communism","11:47 PM","government-debates","79"

"02-14-2003","94",6,"None","None","None","Broker","2105","Major socialist countries are literally dying. Sweden is a socialist place, and it states in their constitution that their government's main purpose is to provide social welfare for the people. Their population is rising .02% because of people coming into the country. If that cuts, their population will be decreasing...sometimes it probably already has decreased because there are more deaths than births.","differences-between-socialism-communism","07:02 PM","government-debates","86"
"02-22-2003","94",6,"None","None","None","Debater","2752","I want to comment on the original question. According to Karl Marx socialism is stepping stone to reach the perfect - communism. Large govt control forcing all to cooperate so that when people did cooperate large govt could disapear and the people live in communism. Well that was at least the theory Marx came up with.","differences-between-socialism-communism","12:32 AM","government-debates","87"

What he wanted is that people live in a community in which everyone is perfect. But socialism in his view was the stage in which the few evil nonconformists would be weeded out or shown the ""truth.""","differences-between-socialism-communism","10:18 PM","government-debates","89"

There will always be those who want to change things...a socialist infrastructure is very hard to change. People rely on the government after that step in...and once you step in, the door almost completely shuts.","differences-between-socialism-communism","10:27 PM","government-debates","90"
