"02-12-2004","1742",1,"None","None","None","DrD","34610","By now, most people should realize the war in Iraq was not necessary. The excuse Bush and his regime used to start the war was that we had to disarm Iraq of Weapons of Mass Destruction. The British even said these WMD could be used against us within 45 minutes! As everyone now knows, the WMD did not exist. The excuse for war has been proven to be a fraud. What made it possible for the Bush regime and the forces for war to bring off their deadly and destructive goal successfully? An article in The Guardian, Thursday July 17, 2003, sheds some important light on one element that lead to the unnecessary carnage and war that is still going on despite Bush's ""Mission Accomplished"" show. That element is Israel. Senior Bush regime officials, including defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld, took a bunch of neocons and formed them into a group called Office of Special Plans. The purpose of OSP was to cook the intelligence reports from the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency until it looked the way the forces for war wanted it to look. And the forces for war wanted to paint the false picture of Saddam and Iraq as a threat to the US and the ""free"" world. The Guardian article reported: ""The OSP was an open and largely unfiltered conduit to the White House not only for the Iraqi opposition. It also forged close ties to a parallel, ad hoc intelligence operation inside Ariel Sharon's office in Israel specifically to bypass Mossad and provide the Bush administration with more alarmist reports on Saddam's Iraq than Mossad was prepared to authorize. ""'None of the Israelis who came were cleared into the Pentagon through normal channels,' said one source familiar with the visits. Instead, they were waved in on Mr. Feith's authority without having to fill in the usual forms. ""The exchange of information continued a long-standing relationship Mr. Feith and other Washington neo-conservatives had with Israel's Likud party. ""In 1996, he and Richard Perle - now an influential Pentagon figure - served as advisers to the then Likud leader, Binyamin Netanyahu. In a policy paper they wrote, entitled A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm, the two advisers said that Saddam would have to be destroyed, and Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Iran would have to be overthrown or destabilized, for Israel to be truly safe."" The reason Americans are now dying and being maimed in Iraq is to make sure Israel is ""truly safe."" The pro-Israel neocons can't come right out and say Americans must die to ensure Israel's safety. Instead they get a greedy, ignorant, egotistical individual like Bush, have one of their own (Paul Wolfowitz) whisper in his ear to destroy Saddam, and the rest is history/current event! Americans should prepare themselves to sacrifice more for the chosen people! After all, Iraq was just one nation the neocons and the Jews want regime change in. We will have to spend more priceless lives and tens of billions of dollars more in Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Iran! Already the main stream media is parroting the lie from Israel that perhaps Iraq hid the nonexistent WMD in Syria. The Guardian article reported that intelligence sources said that lie originated in the office of the Israeli prime minister. When will Americans, especially those in the US armed forces, say enough is enough? After Syria? After Iran? Or, hopefully, NOW!","ingredients-unnecessary-war","10:19 AM","government-debates","1"

"02-16-2004","1742",1,"None","None","None","plotter","34890","Let me get this straight, your saying israeli sources persuaded bush and company, to invade iraq. Ok lets assume your right, why didnt they persuade them to invade iraq, in say 1998. Surely clinton would have gone for it, or would he? He did bomb them which kept them in line, although i dont think he would have enough political backing for an invasion. I think, and most people do, that the 9/11, allowed bush to go to war, people became paranoid that it might happen again with worse consequences so he had a good ""excuse"" to go to war, which clinton never had. However the problem was, there was never any link between him and alquida. So an excuse was needed and evidence of WMDs was overblown to and sold to a nervous and gullible public that saddam was a threat to the world and so he had to go. And so the war took place. Your connection with israel is a bit dubius, and i wouldnt be suprised if there was a connection, but iraq was invaded in the aftermath of 9/11, if iraq was invaded before 9/11 your claims would be more acceptable. Oh and broker, can you be specific as to what your saying and to who your refering to.","ingredients-unnecessary-war","08:56 AM","government-debates","9"

Subject: Amazing How Fast the Dumb O Crats can forget what they said! just had to share this with you folks. It is amazing how quickly the dumb o crats can forget what they said, and attack the commander in chief. This has been checked out and what you are going to read are essentially the words spoken by the Dumb O Crats. Re-evaluating Weapons of Mass Destruction ""One way or the other, we are determined to deny Iraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line."" - President Clinton, Feb. 4, 1998 ""If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program."" - President Clinton, Feb. 17, 1998 ""Iraq is a long way from [here], but what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face."" - Madeline Albright, Feb 18, 1998 ""He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983."" - Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb, 18, 1998 ""We urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs."" - Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998 ""Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process."" - Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998 ""Hussein has ... chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies."" - Madeline Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999 ""There is no doubt that ... Saddam Hussein has invigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies."" - Letter to President Bush, Signed by Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL,) and others, December 5, 2001 ""We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandated of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them."" - Sen. Carl Levin (D, MI), Sept. 19, 2002 ""We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country."" - Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002 ""Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power."" - Al Gore, Sept. 23, 2002 ""We have known for many years that Saddam Hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction."" - Sen. Ted Kennedy (D, MA), Sept. 27, 2002 ""The last UN weapons inspectors left Iraq in October of 1998. We are confident that Saddam Hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons, and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons..."" - Sen. Robert Byrd (D, WV), Oct. 3, 2002 ""I will be voting to give the President of the United States the authority to use force-- if necessary-- to disarm Saddam Hussein because I believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security."" - Sen. John F Kerry (D, MA), Oct. 9, 2002 ""There is unmistakable evidence that Saddam Hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years .. We also should remember we have always underestimated the progress Saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction."" - Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D, WV), Oct 10, 2002 ""He has systematically violated, over the course of the past 11 years, every significant UN resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons, and any nuclear capacity. This he has refused to do"" - Rep. Henry Waxman (D, CA), Oct. 10, 2002 ""In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al Qaeda members. It is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare, and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons."" - Sen. Hillary Clinton (D, NY), Oct 10, 2002 ""We are in possession of what I think to be compelling evidence that Saddam Hussein has, and has had for a number of years, a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction."" - Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL), Dec. 8, 2002 ""Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime .... He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation ... And now he is miscalculating America's response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction. So the threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real."" - Sen. John F. Kerry (D, MA), Jan. 23. 2003 SO NOW THE DEMOCRAT LEADERSHIP SAY PRESIDENT BUSH LIED, THAT THERE NEVER WERE ANY WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND HE TOOK US TO WAR FOR HIS OIL BUDDIES???

The problem is that the US-army isnt meant to do peace-keeping jobs. Do you think this is done by the US in successful way? If it is why arent the British soldiers attacked so often as the Americans?

"03-04-2004","1742",1,"DrD","None","...What may have been true in 1998 may not have been true in 2002. To quote any source after the change in the administrations is to rely on the information of the present administration, not the past one... ...When Bush made these statements, both were untrue... ...If it was true, how could this 3rd world country move tons of WMD in 2 weeks. Or, if they could move them, why wasn't the movement tracked by the same satellites that discovered them?...","jim's trucking","37939","I'm not blaming the Democrats for anything, except telling lies to forward their campaign against Bush. Democrats will do anything to get elected. Succeeding Presidents depend on the same intelligence and a constant flow of it. The incoming President is briefed by the outgoing President to aid in the smooth transition of power and intelligence. The CIA and other intelligence sources do not change much with the election of a new President. You don't know that Bush's statements were untrue. You just think they were. WMDs could be transported in trucks, ox-carts, on camel's back, under clothing, and many other ways that could not be detected by satellite and possible not even if you were standing next to the road. Holes can be dug in minutes. Your argument is flawed.","ingredients-unnecessary-war","10:32 AM","government-debates","15"
