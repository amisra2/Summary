"03-04-2004","1742",3,"The_Comedian","None","It is great for the Shiits to be able to celebrate. It is also great that one dictator is gone. But these are things people in dozens of countries are dreaming of. So why start in a country which could set a whole region afire? And the protests against the occupation are possible but they arent reaching anything through it; so should the Iraqis be happy about the possibility to protest although it wont change their lives? And about the argument with the terrorist attack: The only major attack on America from the outside was 9/11. And one reason for no more further attacks might also be that the extremists have a much shorter travel to Bagdad than to Washington .","DrD","37988","Wish I would had written this!!","ingredients-unnecessary-war","11:48 AM","government-debates","31"
"03-04-2004","1742",3,"DrD","None","You didn't refute anything I wrote . Just thought I would let you know. I don't even try to debate with people who refer to others as you liberals. Sounds too much like Rush Limbaugh, is pajorative, unnecessary and is supposed to be derragatory. Not to mention the fact that absolutely nothing will change your narrow mind about any political situation unless someone like Limbaugh says so. Personally, I like to think for myself.","jim's trucking","37991","Wrong again! You obviously can't recognize refutation when it's printed before you. I haven't made the tag ""you liberals"" derogatory. You liberals have done that to yourselves. I suppose you'd rather be called a social reformist! Actually, socialist is closer to a true description.","ingredients-unnecessary-war","11:51 AM","government-debates","32"
"03-04-2004","1742",3,"fracas","None","Sistani's voice has been the most influential for change in iraq. the protests have affected the governance of iraq why iraq? because it was in violation of a ceasefire because it was an oppressive government because if left unaddressed threaten the entire region again (as it did against iraq and kuwait) because it was an opportunity to transform the region for the better, a region that has festered and starting to metastasize its woe and better baghdad than washington","The_Comedian","37993","These points could be addressed to Rwanda as well. To be honest, I only rate the last one as a real argument, and then again not, because if the US wanted to establish democracy in the ME, why not start with diplomatic talks in Egypt? You could have told Mubarrak for years that his re-elections with a 95% win arent democratic (even Saddam has been more honest in that point, at least he got 100% ). Please dont tell GI Joes mom.","ingredients-unnecessary-war","11:53 AM","government-debates","34"

But my question is still why did the USA have to start their new ""humanity-preserving-role"" with a war and in a region where much more risk is involved than in other countries with similar problems? It also isnt neccessarily about ""imposing western values on sovereign states"", it would be less (especially in the inhabitants eyes) e.g. if the first American company in Iraq wasnt a BK joint .","ingredients-unnecessary-war","02:16 PM","government-debates","39"
"03-04-2004","1742",3,"fracas","None","why iraq and why now? well a rhetorical response along my sig would be why not iraq and why not now. but a more comprehensive response. 1. 911 transformed the way we pursue our foreign policy 2. there was an opportunity with iraq because 2a. he was a well recognized and documented madman (but this is not unique to the world) 2b. because iraq is in the ME where most of terrorism is currently exported from (also not unique to the region) 2c. because iraq had agreed to terms of a ceasefire which it then violated for the next 12+ years while sanctions have failed to bring about meaningful policy changes in saddam while hurting the iraqi themselves (unique opportunity) this has got to be a joke, right? there were other US companies in iraq before BK and the ""imposing western values on sovereign states"" pertained to how these ""sovereign"" states behave politically, not economically.","The_Comedian","38077","1. Thats obvious but did you change your policy in a good way? 2a. One among many, like you said. But the only one known to most Americans and most other Western people. 2b. In Saudi Arabia they are teaching the most radical form of the Islam and they sent teachers to Afghanistan to help the Pakistani intel to support the Taliban. Palestine also produces more terrorists as might Syria do. Saddam was known to pay money to the families of suicide bombers that killed Israelis but not for working together with religious extremists and those are the ones who really threaten the USA. 2c. The sanctions were a bad method and it was obvious very early that only the poor population would suffer. Anyway, I think this is a valid pro-war argument. I still think it would be better to start changing the third world with diplomacy and not with war. Yes, it was meant as a joke. But the grain of truth is that there really was a BK at the Bagdad airport pretty soon after the troops secured it. It just was a too nice symbol for Western sure nstinct .","ingredients-unnecessary-war","02:49 PM","government-debates","41"
