It doesn't matter if the actions are justified or not, the average Iraqi would associate america with suffering. Their have been people imprisoned by saddam for years that still want nothing to do with the US. * Iraqi public opinion remains largely favorable to reconstruction. This is certainly true of the vast bulk of the Kurdish and Shiite populations, but it is also true of many urban Sunnis (the bulk of that ethno-religious group). Most Iraqis don't particularly care to have so many foreigners in their country, but there is a widespread fear that if the United States were to leave Iraq, the country would slide quickly into chaos and civil war -- a fear amply justified by patterns on the ground. Consequently, most Iraqis do not want the United States to leave; they just want the United States to do a better job rebuilding their country. * Similarly, most of Iraq's leaders have shown great patience and urged their followers to cooperate with the U.S.-led reconstruction. They appear to recognize that the United States ultimately is striving to build the stable, prosperous, and pluralist nation they hope for. They also seem to realize that all of the alternatives to cooperation with the United States are much worse, and much less likely to produce their ideal outcome; thus they have generally counseled restraint despite repeated missteps by the United States.","fracas","39387","i think you will find the truth in iraq otherwise. the only and last poll in iraq from a few months ago suggested otherwise. reports from people in iraq suggests otherwise. consider this article one sample link","ingredients-unnecessary-war","06:13 PM","government-debates","91"

Only a little more than a quarter of those surveyed felt ""very safe."" ----------------------------------------------------------------------- And there was another poll that if anything suggest that the iraqis hate americans ================================================== ===== American forces in Iraq are obsessed with force protection and with tracking down the insurgents who are attacking them, and as a result they are providing little security to the Iraqi people. And the Iraqis know it: in the IRI poll taken in early October, only 7 percent said that coalition forces or coalition patrols contributed most to their sense of security ================================================== ===== Where does your link provide evidence that they would prefer americans to the french or the UN? It makes the reasonable claim that some Iraqis don't want the US to leave because the country will decay into civil war. But that does not mean there is not a large degree of anti-american/westerner/pagan sentiment in Iraq. I hope the US administration actually has a good idea about the opinions of Iraqis and uses this information to guide policy decisions. Hopefully all this ""were magnificent, only scum don't love us"" XXXXXXXX is just for the masses.","ingredients-unnecessary-war","07:50 PM","government-debates","92"

American cluster bombs have killed Iraqi children. America has interfered with the politics of middle eastern countries. It does not matter if these things were for the greater good they would still cause hatred. Not everyone would hate america but I would be surprised if their was a large anti US feeling in Iraq. Historically when westerners interfered in the politics of foriegn lands it was to steal from them or to strike a XXXX against Islam. Why would the typical Iraqi assume that the west has changed its ways? Just because you have seen things that make you faith in the US does not mean a typical Iraqi has.","ingredients-unnecessary-war","09:42 PM","government-debates","94"
