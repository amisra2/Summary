"03-11-2004","1742",6,"plotter","None","No, personally you fell for the propoganda trap, why invade a helpless third world country crippled by a decade of sanctions. Doh, i forgot oil, but lets dress it up for the gullible american public as WMDs and evil regime, that way it can be justified, but dont mention oil. It was for the iraqi people, america invaded iraq for the love of the iraqi people, now lets see who else america loves, chechens, no way, russia can fight back, Zimbabwe, they got a nasty racist dictator, no, no oil, how abou sri lanka, civil war there people killing each other, na, no oil. Need i go on? just ask. Where shall we start, saddam, he was a very good american friend, even rumsfeld shook hands with him and congratulated him on his stance against fundemantalists in iran, america even helped him, arms, chemical weapons finance, etc... Taliban, helped them fight the soviet invasion of afghanistan, even bin laden, LOL. Milosovic, he was a friend, helped in the peace accord in bosnia, remember deyton. All those eastern european countries that helped the allies, sold out to stalin, there are more. Who wants to be friends with america, well everybody of course, lol, even castro, theres a lot of dollars available to any american friendly dictators, would you like me to name them?","fracas","39282","amazing! i responded to all of your post and you still don't get it let me try again and i'll be straight forward this time since your range of comprehension and debate seem limited. why invade a helpless third world country crippled by a decade of sanctions? because they were deemed in violation of the ceasefire and still was developing wmd that could then be used on their neighbors has they had with the kurds and iran. all the world thought iraq was still actively developing wmd, from the UN, france, germany, russia, uk, and the US. if you have evidence that the world knew (note past tense, knew as in before the war started) iraq did not have wmd, i would love to see. if not, as i have already suggested, a whine of ""lies!"" besides, as i've already mentioned there were harmful effects on the iraqi because of the UN sanctions oil? how do you mean by this? did the US do it to gain oil for itself? no. there has been no evidence of this based on previous US opportunity to take over kuwait and control the oil delivery through the straight of hormuz. and since the invasion, there has been no attempt to grab the oil. so if you have evidence to suggest that the war was for oil, i would like to see it. otherwise it is only as i suggested already, a worned out chant without substance. iraqi vs chechens vs zimbawe? iraq because it is in the middle east. a region devoid of democracy and freedom. a region spawning radical international terrorist like no other. the thought being if a free and secure democratic stronghold in the ME can be established, this would spread and go a long way toward preventing the spread of radical fundamentalism. iraq is a cultural center of the ME with a people who are more capable and yearning for democracy than most in the region. iraq also because there was a ""legal"" opportunity to do so. the ""legal"" opportunity comes about from violation of the ceasefire, a ceasefire from a US lead and UN sanctioned war against iraq in 91. in short, iraq because of both the need and the opportunity to do so. why not chechens? because there is no such state as chechnya. because it is legally part of russia. because the chechens have taken up terrorism. it is not because of fear of russia, afterall, the soviet union had already been confronted and defeated. russia is just a shadow of the soviet union. why not zimbabwe? because there is not enough resources to do so. because there is no legal opportunity to do so. because Mugabe did not declared himself as a regional threat at least until 5 years ago. we waited 12 years with iraq, we can wait longer with zimbabwe. because property is being taken, not people butchered. why not sri lanka? because there is a ceasefire there already brokered by the norwegians in 2001 personally if we have the resources to do so, i would wage a global war against despotism! but resource is limited, thus a priority list has to be formulated . this is reasonable to do what you can when you can, do it in a priority order and do it well enough to win. oil can be bought elsewhere. oil can be gotten from alaska which we have not wanted to do. it wasn't anymore about oil in 2003 than it was in 91. saddam i have already acknowledge that he was an ally against the fundamentalism of iran. but note that the term ally as applied to saddam is very loose. iraq had always been first in the soviet sphere of influence. note that they use soviet equipments for instance. when the soviet started crumbling, who step in? the french. look it up. the US interaction with saddam regarding military totalled less than 10% the top three? fraqnce, germany, and russia. look it up. and economically? jordan, france, germany, and russia again! but then he started acting out. the US started distancing themselves when he started using wmd against iran, and later against the kurds. the break come when he invaded kuwait. why was he ever a ""friend"" at all? because initially he wasn't obviously a madman and a threat to the region. taliban the US never helped the taliban militarily or recognized them diplomatically. look it up. they were but one of many bands fighting against the soviet but their rise did not actually occurred until after the soviet had withrawn. you don't know your history as well as you think (and as evidenced by your germany comment) bin laden same with saddam. he wasn't seen as a terrorist. he was seen has fighting in afghanistan against the soviet invasion of afghanistan to liberate afghanistan. in the setting of the cold war, why not? did he sprout anti-western rhetorics then? did he ordered planes into buildings then? did he had to go bad? well he did choose to and when he did, we quickly branded him as terrorist and sought to hunt him down even before 911. look it up. milosovic lol. he wasn't a friend with bosnia at all! bosnia was originally viewed by Clinton as a European problem. afterall, it is in europe. but the european couldn't decide what to do as bosnia was being cleansed, so the UN was brought in. and a swell job they did too defending sebrenica! it wasn't until the europeans had failed and the UN had failed did the US take up the charged by bombing milosovic's home town of belgrade and forced a end to the war in bosnia. so he gave in. he ""help"" in so as much as was forced to stop supporting the bosnian serbs. and when he resumed similar in Kosovo, the US didn't wait so much for the Europeans or the UN this time before they let bombs dropped in serbia and supported the opposition in serbia and the montenegrans. you need to read more before you make silly charges such as this one. eastern europe did not help the allies against the nazi. they were actually satellite states and allies that provided troops for the nazi. (what history book are you reading?!?) a substantial of your charges are grossly historically inaccurate. the remainder would require someone with preconiscience because when saddam came to power, and bin laden fighting the soviet, no one thought them likely to go mad. this is why i charged you with being an end justifies the means, placing emphasis on outcome after the fact to judge the actions leading to the outcome. who wants to be friends with america? i've already answered this one 1. the japanese wanted to be friends after ww2 2. so did the germans 3. so do the chinese as they seek greater economic ties to both improve themselves as a power and improve the lot for the chinese 4. the vietnamese do, much like the chinese, despite losing a million people in a war barely more than a generation ago with the US 5. the eastern europeans do. and no, they don't trade with the US as much as they do with western europe. yet they sided with the US against germany and france in the lead up to the war 6. the iraqi do. read what the average iraqi are saying. and no, the majority of iraqi are not placing roadside bombs and blowing up other iraqi. they much rather be friend with the US than the french or the UN 7. the irannians want to become friends, there has been numerous accounts since they have resumed pilgrimage to iraq holy sites. does everyone wants to friends with the US, no. but in addition to the above there are others. thus i charged you with the error of generalizing from a part to the whole. much of what i posted is simple history and media reports nothing from any official government pronouncements. you charge of propaganda only betrays your own brainwashing by the peacemongers and america-haters, and your own gross ignorance of history.","ingredients-unnecessary-war","08:03 PM","government-debates","76"
"03-11-2004","1742",6,"fracas","None","the policy of the enemy of my enemy is my friend has always been the standard for international diplomacy since inception what are your suggestions to handle a pariah government isolate them like NK? engage them like South Africa during apartheid to affect changes? i think you answered your own question there is a huge reluctance in diplomacy to give strict dates because it always come accross as an ultimatum. international diplomacy has always involved both threats and payment. when the axis thing came out, i was a bit perplexed myself. since then i have been surprised how radical the NK government really is as it sells weapon technology and even drugs abroad to perpetuate its cult of personality. and the charges against iran being oppressive certainly true, especially invalidating 1/3 of the candidates for recent election. and their nuclear weapon programs much further along than anyone thought. regarding the iranians themselves, i am continually surprised at how the younger iranians view the US more and more positive than their elder, and as a whole since the war. many iranians pilgrim have come to iraq and have interacted with american GIs. their response have all been surprisingly positive. i think the government in general is focusing on finding the best solution. since humans are imperfect i don't expect the government to be either. there are articles on diplomatic exchanges in the US as well. But they are not usually on the front page. who do you hear it from if not the media? yes, the fundamentalist will not like it at all when the ME is democratized. But the new way isn't about appeasing the fundamentalists who hate the US (hate is irrational and cannot be addressed by reason), the new way is about making life better for middle easterners and when life is better, radical fundamentalism preaching hate would have a harder time taking root and spreading.","The_Comedian","39285","I think it would be different than your examples. Egypt relies on US aid. They couldnt restist for years to change. It couldnt be too drastic, but over the years, a lot could have happened. And it would also be quite cheap as no troops would be needed. Thats true but why even bother the security council with a resolution when you are already sure about the outcome like the US were? Saddam was scared (due to the military threat) and the inspections worked better than before. The US did entirely rely on the problem, that a 'material breach' could be nearly anything and that the 'countermeasures' (dont know the exact term right now) could be nearly anything. Agreed. NK takes its only chance, imo. It cant expect any confessions from the international community. After the US showed that they would start a war instead of endless diplomatics (*quote could be used against me* ), NK needed everything that would prevent a war or invasion. A few missiles and a handful of nukes is enough in their case to keep others away. It is, however, maybe the most difficult problem to solve. But military solutions are the least useful imo. The young Iranians are in a sad position. The vast majority of them would like to live like young people in our countries; go to dances, meet girls and boys, visit a bar or go to cinema. All of these things are restricted or forbidden by the Mullahs. They get a very good school education and their universities are good as well. But their degrees are nearly useless because there are no jobs, Economic changes are slowed or stopped by the Mullahs. The youths chance was the election that Chatami won first (90ies). They voted for him because they hoped and believed that he would change things quickly. Problem was that the judicative is controlled by the religious elite, same with other gremiums that decide about significant reforms. So he could only change few things and not in a fast way. To keep his position at home, he also couldnt give in to many of the Western and ,especially, US demands. We made the mistake and judged this as an old behaviour and didnt give enough support. At the end, the West saw Chatami as a puppet of the Mullahs, the Mullahs still regarded him as dangerous and the youths thought he failed. Now, voices get louder to show the West the importance of Iran and the radicals can enforce their will to get the bomb like Pakistan did. The young people dont show much interest in politics anymore and so a big chance was gone imo. Agreed. Got me. But official speeches include the terms 'war' , 'enemy' , 'modern warfare' and 'military budgets' more often than in recent years. I refer to Bushs speech to the nation and other conferences where international issues were discussed. I just think that the fundamentalists will have a harder time to recruit followers on a peaceful street than in bombed-out cities. And the time that it takes to get streets out of ruins is time that is ticking for the fundamentalists.","ingredients-unnecessary-war","09:43 PM","government-debates","77"

I noticed this over your past few posts, that your seeing things from an innacurate version of history. Half the things you state never happenned, or never happenned the way you believed them to have happenned, whichever, i think you should stop reading propoganda magazines and papers, and read a few encyclopedias, that way you will learn historical facts not propoganda fiction. I made specific points to you, i even reposted them more than 3 times, i even simplified them for you so you can understand them better, you never answered them, Obviously you cannot answer them so i wont bother reposting them, they were a bit tricky. I also made statements regarding international law amongst other things, you also completely ignored them to, if your just going to ignore the majority of my points and go into a political propoganda rant, there really isnt any point, im not discussing anythimg with you here your just attempting, badly, to justify an illegal war using propoganda, inaccurate historical facts and well, quite childish views. I would like to ask you, how old are you? i have a funny feeling you may still be in school.","fracas","39311","this is so lame, your response i responded to every thing you posted, just not what you wanted to hear. and if you fail to deliver your point clearly and succinctly beyond a rant, than its your own short coming. and just because i have not justified the invasion to you does not mean i have not esponded to the questions, or posted justifications as i see it. how very lame. have a hard time accepting a reality other than yours? whatever. i have already told you that a new policy has been enacted since 911 and all you can whine about is the old policy. get over it. LOL instead of reading today's news about wmd, why don't you go back and read news from before the war as to what these nations thought. but if you can provide links to declaration that they did not think iraq had wmd, i'd like to see it. even just prior to the war hans blix did not declare iraq free from wmd. did i mention that these nations ""sanctioned"" the invasion and had they did, what would it had meant? the UN by last resolution acknowledged violation and warned of dire consequences in the setting of a ceasefire. that alone was sufficient. and when i asked for proof you gave none. yes, when you can't counter an argument with your own proof, charge the other guys with propaganda. yay! LOL who would have thought the iraqi would have looted their own national treasures? but read the news again, the charges of looting especially with the museum was over stated (the good stuffs had been locked away) and yes, iraqi national resources had to be protected because oil was needed for iraq's reconstruction and future. iraqi oil for iraq! gasp! how shocking is that? do show me the companies that have oil contract for iraqi oil? i would love to see it. stupid. they are not shinny example of ME democracy. more stupidity. iraq was found to be in violation not just with not allowing inpsection, but when the inspectors return they found the newly developed missiles exceed the limits of the aggreed to terms. violation. LOL indeed they just decided on their own to disband with no pressure from the west/US whatsover. that NK, vietnam, and afghanistan wasn't the west fighting the sino-soviet block through proxy. didn't you admitted that vietnam was supported by a ""superpower""? or do you not believe proxy war real war? tell that to the dead. ignorant. and you call me a revisionist. LOL see everything i've already posted about legality and illegality of war. yet by your definition of consistency means that everything happens at once or in rapid succession without any real comprehension of priority and time. a snap shot in time is all you see, no wonder you have such an innovative sense of history! LOL long before america is up a creek, europe and japan would have crashed economically because both are substantially more dependent on imported oil. again LOL. i have already stated that the major backers of saddam early on was the soviets, the french, and the german both militarily and economically. the US contribution was very minor in comparison. but being a minor contributor the US should carry primary responsibility. LOL. the US never encouraged saddam to fight iran. he saw and opportunity for gains and did it. since you make the charge, provide the proof? how ignorant can you be?! the taliban and the mujarhardeen are not one and the same. the US did support the Mujarhardeen in general, but not the taliban in particular. guilty by association? you must know the future then! great for you. no one at the time predicted that bin laden would become a terrorist. all you seem capable of doing is to judge the acts by the results. ends justify the means sort of guy. that if the end was bad, the means must have been bad as well. LOL. are you kidding me? he was president of serbia who was supporting the serbs activity in bosnia. ofcourse he had to be negotiated with, but negotiating with someone doesn't mean you back him or allies with him. guilty by association, eh? LOL because you have brought nothing to the discussion except the usual anti-american rants. and failed to demonstrated any comprehension when presented with the facts. i've justified the reasons for war. you haven't been able to counter any of it directly. any of it! you tried to drag in previous american actions and then you tried the chant the mantra of lies/oil/illegality. you haven't done anything but whine about the US. simplistic. the point is that you ally with someone when you think you have similar goals. when this is no longer the case, the alliance should end. in case you don't know, this is the natural order of things whether it be an individual or a nation. in your scheme of things we should have supported saddam when he invaded kuwait because we supported him years before. by your reasoning for consistency we should still be supporting bin laden. you asked who would want to be friend with the US, i listed. now you specify politically be friends? believe it or not, economic is the primary motivator for friendships on the international scene. and every political system have always been about the regulations of humans as pertain to economics. but if you want a short list of nations who want to be friends with the US for political reasons, lets try: UK, canada, spain, australia, japan tell you what, generate a point by point list of where i was wrong and i'll consider it. all you have done thus far has been to generate the usual anti-american chants and when confronted, posted revisionist history that bin laden was a terrorist from the get go that the taliban and the mujarhardeen are one and the same that the soviet union decided without any pressure to dissolve. yeah, don't bother because i have responded to you point by point each and every time. but you just don't get it. provide proof like i've asked repeatedly? prove 1. the wmd lies (assuming you know what lies mean, an intent to deceive) 2. illegality 3. it was for oil i don't want your personal counter to my arguments, i want proof of your statements LOL basically because i don't agree with your interpretation i don't get it LOL legality issues i have addressed time and time again what you don't seem to get that a general sentiment against war does not make it legal. legality requires a document. i've asked for a legal document against the war and you haven't produced one. all you have done is chanted the usual anti-war ****. and when i provided reasoning you called them propaganda and revisionist history without any proof to back up your own claims show me the proofs of your claims? LOL resorting to age check are we? so if you are older than you are wiser? and if you are younger you are still smarter? LOL what is next, sex checks? race checks?

Not only that, if it was just about oil it would have been better to either buy the oil from saddam after he annexed kuwait, or buy the oil from him after kuwait was liberated, or kept Kuwait under the US thumb and taken all its oil.

Now all that youve said ive heard many times before, you misread history and belive your right, thats not your fault, its what youve been taught, and i dont expect you to change your views, you cant as youve been brainwashed to believe the nonsense youve been told, thankfully not all americans think the way you do, luckily the majority do have the ability to think for themselves, and its good your in the minority.

I posed you a few difficult question of which you could not answer, so you became defensive and started to attack me, there the actions of a juvenile who has been caught out. You also find what i have to say amusing, again you are dismissing what you cannot answer. I have already told you, twice, im not interested in your biased propoganda fuelled views, but you still respond with biased rantings, i can understand if you cannot answer my points, but the tone of your posts suggest you are getting angry and frustrated at you lack of understanding of the real world, so i suggest you try and improve your knowledge of world affairs, and try to understand what is being written. Ive also noticed a few other members are questioning your views, they are also asking you good question which you are finding difficult to answer, Youve even attempted to dismiss there views, dont you think you may be wrong.
