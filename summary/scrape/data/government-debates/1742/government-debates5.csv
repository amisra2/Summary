"03-10-2004","1742",5,"fracas","None","1. trade deficit is the responsibility of the president and not the american consumer who don't buy americans? so force americans and american corporations to buy americans, either through subsidies or tarriffs? didn't we try that with steel? 2. an unreliable friend is worse than a reliable enemy 3. 500 GI and 11,000 iraqi over 1 year to take over a country of 25000000. yes, remarkably low casualties. amazing even. 4. iraqi civil war? 5. whose constitution? 6. explain the ""americas moral self serving values"". unclear. care to explain or did the rant just ""sounded"" good? 7. i am sure the solution would be to give the arabs israel. Didn't the french give up alsace and lorraine for peace and security? and then again with britain give up the sudentenland for ""peace in our time""? yay! lets leave them alone and we'll all be fine. 8. yes, lets leave the ME. that will be the model with which to build a better future. when someone attacks you, just go home cause it has to be your fault you were attacked. I love how violence is justified upon the victims. what if your mom gets raped? it had to be her fault too eh? for being where she wasn't safe, for being a woman, for just being. lame.","plotter","39004","Bush took over a trade surplus, now you have the biggest deficit in history and still growing. You tried steel tarrifs, in a, look after number 1 mentality, but the E.U retaliated with sanctions, E.U are not as gullible or as desperate as some arab or african state, so you lost that one. 2. now thats a great quote, sums up america in a sentence, how many of your so called friends have you let down, if you like i can mention a few in a long long list. 3. Very remarkable, 11500+ dead, amazing, for what? WMDs lol, they never existed, 11500+dead for an illegal and pointless war, yep thats amazing. 4. Iraqi civil war, have you been following the news? Shi'tes being blown up, sunni's and kurds killing themselves, no security, doh, what does that tell you? That there all living happily ever after, NO, heading towards civil war. 5. Constitution? What the american written one, yep thats what the iraqis want. The rant sounded just great, bit too close to the truth was it, that made you respond in such a manner, trying to justify your position. If you interfere in other countries affairs dont expect them to welcome you with open arms. Now what didnt you understand about ""americas self serving moral values"" very self explanatory, you interfere in countries that have something you want, then you try to impose your moral values where there not wanted. No the answer is not to give israel to the arabs, but to give the pallestinians there own country and treat them as equals. France didnt give back alsace, it was german, the germans took it back, if i take your wallet, will you let me have it, no you would want it back. Britain never owned the sudetenland, it was german speaking area of czechoslovakia, it was the allies, of which america was part of who gave the sudetenland to germany, on the account it was a ethnic german speaking region, just like kosovo, america gave that to ethnic albanians too Yes leave the middle east, it would solve a lot of problems, then you wont have an enemy flying aircraft into the side of buildings, if someone attacks you, they have a reason, if you interfere in other peoples affairs for your own ambitions then expect to be attacked. What a silly comparison, comparing rape and political wars, yep silly, maybe a desperate attempt to justify illegal actions.","ingredients-unnecessary-war","08:35 AM","government-debates","61"

Some of them make sense or I can understand how you get to them. It still leaves me with one problem, especially when it is always noted how big the chance of an arab democracy in Iraq was and how other nations could be affected as well. What does an American tell a guy from egypt if he asks: ""Why are you waiting 12 years while people are starving and then even 1 year of inspections would be too long? And why didnt you use these 12 years to get some confessions from Mubarrak?"" After 9/11, the US used only a military way to solve problems. Not one of the options to bring democracy to the ME in a peaceful way was used and maybe not even thought about. Sure, these problems werent solved by the Clinton-administration as well, but howcome the hatred for the US has rather increased since 9/11 than decreased? And not only in classical anti-US countries.","ingredients-unnecessary-war","09:07 AM","government-debates","62"
"03-10-2004","1742",5,"fracas","None","yup, that is why government should not interfere in trade as long as it is fair. i personally don't worry about the trade deficit as you do. besides, a US trade deficit, being the largest economy in the world, is good for the world. please do. and add to that the countries that still want to be the US's friends. read the whole thread, or even some of the news. it was never just about wmd. and while you are at it, read some history as to learn the cost in human lives of other wars. this one was paltry by comparison. americans kill americans everyday so i guess we are in a civil war, eh? read some history and political-military theories on the path from insurgency to civil war if it works, i am fine with it. but yet why were the shiite in 92 asking for US intervention? the liberians last year, the haitian this year. why did the lybians seek to normalize relations? or the vietnamesse for better trade relationship? even average iranians. and what moral values are we ""imposing"" oh yeah, no one wants political freedom other than westerners, no one wants a say in how they are govern, no one wants security. all American artifacts. good one! you really don't know your history do you? all those things were done to appease hitler. and that worked out swell! illegal actions? ha ha ha ceasefire -> violation of ceasefire -> resuming ""fire"" again, analogies are lost on you it wasn't about rape vs war it was about the use of violence and the state of victimhood i'll use more concrete concepts for you then if it will be easier.","plotter","39022","how do you figure? but your right there, governments shouldnt interfere as long as its fair Where shall we start, saddam, he was a very good american friend, even rumsfeld shook hands with him and congratulated him on his stance against fundemantalists in iran, america even helped him, arms, chemical weapons finance, etc... Taliban, helped them fight the soviet invasion of afghanistan, even bin laden, LOL. Milosovic, he was a friend, helped in the peace accord in bosnia, remember deyton. All those eastern european countries that helped the allies, sold out to stalin, there are more. Who wants to be friends with america, well everybody of course, lol, even castro, theres a lot of dollars available to any american friendly dictators, would you like me to name them? I was just responding to your post praising bush. History of other wars, yes the casualties were paltry, but that was expected, iraq was never a real threat, a third world army with no modern weaponry, a few ill trained hungry soldiers and a few kalashnikovs, they could really put up a fight, most of the casualties were innocent civilians. You dont get many casualties in such one sided cowardly wars, but if you go aganst an army that can actually fight back, now thats a different story, vietnam comes to mind. lol, killing people for drugs is not a civil war, what would happen if the american troops left iraq tommorow? IF, being the main word. Because america has crippling sanctions on those countries. Haiti didnt ask america they asked the U.N, as did the other countries you mentioned. France offered help as did some other countries, its not a U.S thing. Exactly, the iranians are quite happy with there system for them it works, who is america to say differently, chinese and so on, im no communist, but it seems the chinese system has done well for them, even N korea, economic sanctions imposed on them are causing the problem, if the Koreans dont like there system let them do something about it, what business is it of america. Interesting that you compare hitler and saddam, im not sure which one was worst but the 2 are totally different, hitler wanted german territory back which was taken of the germans during ww1, he had a right to it, it was german. I know my history, unfortunately its you who has a problem understanding the reasons. There was no violation of the ceasefire, hence no WMDs, illegal war.

Well, I think that I disagree with you on the moral imperitive of Iraq being greater than North Korea, but I guess that is a different argument... I guess that I probably disagree with you on a couple of points about Iraq, though perhaps you could explain your second point abot Iraq a little more (the great risk locally....) The main point that I question, I guess it point three. What do you mean by alternatives failed? He did not attack anyone since '91, it seems that he may not have had any wmd for quite some time, in the end he did destroy some of his weapons, and allow weapons inspectors in.

LOL US bad bad bad for illegal activity lets look the other way when iran and NK violate a treaty that offered them peaceful nuclear power in exchange for agreeing not to develop nukes. LOL!!!! that kills me! LOL yeah, they have plenty of resources to spend on nukes they will never use. great! i also got to say the concept of any war ever being legal ludicrous. i can hear it now. ""Lets invade Canada! It's legal!"".

But in this case, inspectors were back after several years and not enough time was given to them. i think you answered your own question there is a huge reluctance in diplomacy to give strict dates because it always come accross as an ultimatum. international diplomacy has always involved both threats and payment. when the axis thing came out, i was a bit perplexed myself. since then i have been surprised how radical the NK government really is as it sells weapon technology and even drugs abroad to perpetuate its cult of personality. and the charges against iran being oppressive certainly true, especially invalidating 1/3 of the candidates for recent election. and their nuclear weapon programs much further along than anyone thought. regarding the iranians themselves, i am continually surprised at how the younger iranians view the US more and more positive than their elder, and as a whole since the war. many iranians pilgrim have come to iraq and have interacted with american GIs. their response have all been surprisingly positive. i think the government in general is focusing on finding the best solution. since humans are imperfect i don't expect the government to be either. there are articles on diplomatic exchanges in the US as well. But they are not usually on the front page. who do you hear it from if not the media? yes, the fundamentalist will not like it at all when the ME is democratized.
