So, I'll ask one more time with the follow up question of ""how do you think it makes you look when you have to avoid direct questions by giving evasive answers this way?"" CUNX, ""Do you believe a child's basic rights should begin when their life does?"" Yes or no. For reference; I can't imagine how you can conceive (per your comments in that earlier post) that killing a pregnant woman can be prosecuted as ""TWO MURDERS ;"" Yet, the ""murdered"" (your word) pre-birth child had no rights to be violated ?!? Do you care enough to explain how that works?","CUNxTime","355192","I think I've been pretty clear... but I'll try again. The mother's right to control her body supersede any rights the baby has.
