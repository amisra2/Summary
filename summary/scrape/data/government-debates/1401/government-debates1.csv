"12-12-2003","1401",1,"None","None","None","Charchuk","27094","Today a great leader was forced to retire by a backstabber. Jean Chrtien is stepping down today to be replaced by Paul Martin as the 21st Prime Minister of Canada. I don't trust Martin because of some of the shaddy deals and things he's done like taking gifts and other bribes from big business. Especially with his manipulation of the federal budgets, while he was finance minister, to make himself look good for a possible stab (and I do mean stab) at being the PM. Chrtien had dismissed him for this. He is way too conservative for my tastes. I think that I'll be voting NDP in the coming election since voting for Martin would be like voting for either the PCs or XXXX.","sad-day-canada","11:33 AM","government-debates","1"

Chretien just got tired of all of their backroom dealings and scheming. Trudeau left basically for the same reason. Too many backstabbers. Well, it looks like Dubya is going to get a PM who is willing to drop his pants for him and to bring him his slippers. It'll be Mul RUIN ey all over again, except that this time it is a liberal.","sad-day-canada","05:10 PM","government-debates","3"

""You couldn't even protect yourselves"" - it sounds to me like you don't really care about what happened. The U.S. worked with Canada throughout the Cold War to protect both countries. I think one reason Canada's military is so small is that we have the U.S. right next to us. I, for one, feel a lot safer. I agree that U.S. protectionism is stupid sometimes. And, I am quite glad to have Paul Martin in office. Although Chetien was fun. I once read a book of absolutely hilarious comments he's made. I think, though, he should be congratulated on serving Canada for so long.","sad-day-canada","05:24 PM","government-debates","9"

Incoming Prime Minister Paul Martin told a news conference Wednesday that he found the ban ""very difficult to fathom,"" adding that Canada has pledged $300 million in aid to Iraq. Deputy prime minister John Manley said the ban makes it ""difficult for us to give further money for the reconstruction of Iraq."" This situation has still not been resolved to Martin's satisfaction.","sad-day-canada","08:14 PM","government-debates","11"

Of course I had cared what had happened. I'm just speaking out against their arrogant attitude that they are the greatest nation on the face of the Earth. What has protected us the most is our location more than anything else. You should recheck your Canadian history. What they mostly was bully Canada. I.E. The Avro Arrow. Think again. With the America's habit of ""friendly fire"" I wouldn't feel so safe. Remember the only nation, in our history, to ever try to invade or attack us was the USA itself. It is all of the time. Martin will be no different than Mul RUIN ey was. He is already in a scandle for taking gifts and rides from his corporate ""friends"".","sad-day-canada","07:15 AM","government-debates","12"
