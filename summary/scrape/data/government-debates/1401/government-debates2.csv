Want me to find it for you? I know that one! 32 million.","epaphras_faith","28079","Really only 32 million canadians. There are something like 300 million or so US citizens. It is a small wonder our military is so much larger. We not only have the populace, we also have the tax base.","sad-day-canada","06:09 PM","government-debates","16"
"12-17-2003","1401",2,"epaphras_faith","None","Just curious, what is Canada's population?","Charchuk","28094","Close to 32 million. It's not the size which matters, but how you use it.","sad-day-canada","06:45 PM","government-debates","17"

So, we have fewer people? We still have a higher standard of living where it counts and we can travel almost anywhere in the world and be treated with real respect and welcome as well for ourselves, not how much money we can bring. Isn't the USA one of the least taxed nations in the 1st world? And it shows.","sad-day-canada","06:48 PM","government-debates","18"
"12-18-2003","1401",2,"Charchuk","None","Now that is an ignorant statement. Of course I had cared what had happened. I'm just speaking out against their arrogant attitude that they are the greatest nation on the face of the Earth. What has protected us the most is our location more than anything else. Think again. With the America's habit of ""friendly fire"" I wouldn't feel so safe. Remember the only nation, in our history, to ever try to invade or attack us was the USA itself. Martin will be no different than Mul RUIN ey was. He is already in a scandle for taking gifts and rides from his corporate ""friends"".","Robbie","28246","I apologize. That's just the way it came across as. And I agree that our location has protected us. They do it on purpose, I suppose. That attack was a long time ago. I think you are generalizing. Martin comes across as conservative, so you don't like him. I think he's apologized for that, as well as taken steps to prevent it in the future. (Of course, that is merely a political ploy) Chetien had his share of scandals. If Chetien said the U.S. didn't do enough for 3rd world countries, and meant that the U.S. deserved 9/11 I lose all respect for him.","sad-day-canada","12:29 PM","government-debates","19"

The US has the higher standard of living. Period. You have to weight things to your favor in order to conclude otherwise.","sad-day-canada","04:26 PM","government-debates","20"
