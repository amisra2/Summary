Sorry. I don't have a lot of knowledge on the topic. I just thought that the movie was well organized and interesting. Especially the part with Marilyn Manson. I had always viewed him as 'bad' or whatever but he presented himself really well during his interview.","bowling-columbine","06:39 PM","government-debates","16"
