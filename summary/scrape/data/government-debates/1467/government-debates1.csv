One day someone is going to bring some bullets in, load the gun, and pull off a bank heist. And it's stupid how people blame everything else, apart from the gun control laws. If it was marilyn manson, then why isn't the problem worse in Germany, which is where goth rock was born?","bowling-columbine","11:40 AM","government-debates","4"

And I give Michael Moore a lot of credit for bringing this issue to attention. Fear seems to be the most efective way by government, media, and advertisers to ""sell"" their product. I guess the main reason for going to war with Iraq was its perceived connection or potential connection to terrorism, and thus the fear of another attack. The fear was strong enough that it has received a high level of support despite the tremendous cost. Fear largely dictates what kind of car we drive(for example, the perception that SUV's are safer) and where we live (suburbinites fear of living in the city, for example). I don't want to rant to long, so I will cut if off, but thanks, witzelcheck, for starting an excellent thread. -Dan","bowling-columbine","01:58 PM","government-debates","5"

"03-10-2004","1467",1,"daewoo","None","I personally didn't really take great offense at the movie. I did feel it was inappropriate for him to brand a political commentary as a documentary, and I think it was downright fraudulent for him to accept an award for it. As far as the gun/bank thing, more power to them. The bank has an FFL. The background check was completed properly. Totally legal transactions done as it should have been. In the movie, it is made to appear that this is all part of the same speach. That clip changed the entire tone of the speech that Heston gave. HIs link doesn't back this up, according to the report he links to, the number is actually much higher. Here is the relevant text: Even the University of Chicagos National Opinion Research Center has invalidated this report, and fired the researcher who carried it out. I can't gaurantee that Moore knows this, we do know that over half of Americans are gun owners, and according to the Pew research center, roughly 20 percent of a random sampling of 15,000 households want stricter gun laws. I would hardly call 20% a majority. Overall, I would say that after hearing his defense (which does lay to rest some of the rumors we have heard) that he is at least as honest as Bill Clinton becasue, after all, Bill Clinton didn't actually have sex with that woman. While the facts as presented by Moore (except for the reprehensible act of turning what was in actuality a good speech by Heston into a bad one) may be technically correct, the conclusion he leads the viewer to is not supportable in the presence of additional evidince which he would have undoubtedly been in posession of during the course of his research for the film. A lie of omission is still a lie.","hvozdany","39051","I agree that he skewed things (as I think everyone does). I am not sure what the definition of a documentary is, but if his film was not a documentary, what was it? I am not sure that a documentary can't express an opinion. Is that written somewhere? I agree. I am really suprised that there is so much written about this here. I think that people are completely missing the point. It is not that anything there was done wrong. Rather, it was just a commentary on our country. The scenes of him buying a gun in a bank, or carrying a gun with him to get his hair cut are, I believe, in there simply to show the attitude in this country about guns, at least in certain areas. Let's not forget that the movie is supposed to be funny. I saw the movie in Connecticut, and those scenes got huge laughs. To many people who live in an urban (and perhaps many other countries), it really seemed obsurd. Again, I stress, I think that it was meant to be funny. I actually saw people on this forum debate whether or not it it safe to sell guns in a bank. Moore was not trying to address this issue!!! Guys, it was supposed to be funny!!!! You have to admit the scene of someone being given a gun in a bank seems very odd. I'll have to look at the scene again, but I will concede that he has probably done this type of thing several times in the movie. He may have made the the speach look worse than it really is, but again, I don't think it is really the point. If what happened at Columbine happened in my town, then shortly after the NRA (an orginization that essentially says that anyone should be able to own any type of gun) showed up I would be very offended. It just seems really offensive to the families of the massacre to come in and promote guns when so many people died because of guns. Why could they just not have been more sensitive to the families? That was his point. I don't know, maybe his number were off (I haven't tried to follow up.) Again, I don't believe that the exact number is important, it is the point. There seems to have a huge problem with gun violance in this country. (both as an absolute number and per capita) That is his point. Yeah, again, I don't know. It would be interesting to see some studies on it, though. I would say, though, that this is not in the movie, is it? I disagree that that not showing both sides is a lie, to me that is showing an opinion, perhapes skewing things, leaving out some things. But to me, not really a lie. That is why I don't accuse Bush about lying about Iraq. I don't think that he did lie. But he left some things out, which misled people. But again, to me, not a lie. What suprises me about all of the pro gun fury about the movie on this page, is that I don't think that his message in the film was that we need more gun control. In fact, I think that he skewed things to make it seem like more gun control is not the answer. He showed Canada has having the same gun laws as we do, which I don't think is true. But he said that Canda had about the same laws, amount of guns, per capita, etc., then showed that they don't have the same problem with gun violence. Thus, the conclusion that he drew, was not that having so many guns in this country is the problem. Really his message in the movie, I think, was about fear in this country. Aye, that got long...looking forward to response...","bowling-columbine","02:56 PM","government-debates","12"

People have different views on this kind of thing. I would agree. I thought it was pretty funny, too. I asked my bank the next time I went in why they don't guve me cool stuff like that. All I have ever gotten from them is a blender, a toaster oven, and a $10 gift certificate to applebees (plus a tin of popcorn each christmas, which I add to all the other tins of popcorn). I think I am getting screwed. THe NRA had no choice. They are required to hold a meeting of voting members each year under new yorks laws for non-profit orgganisations. They cannot change the location of the meeting without giving their memebrs 10 days notice (Also the law). The columbine shootings took place 11 days before the meeting was scheduled to take place. By the time the NRA was able to get everybody together to discuss options, they were inside the 10 day timetable. Really, the NRA meeting would have been almost unnoticable except for all the media hype and moores hype. The parts of the meeting that were open to the public took less than 4 hours and occupied a small auditorium. All other events surrounding the NRA rally were canceled (which Heston stated in his speech, and moore edited out). I don't know if you have ever seen/been to an NRA rally, but usually it is a full weekend with all kinds of activities planned. They did the part they were required to do by law, and tried to do that part quietly. Unfortunatly, the media figured it would make a juicy story and jumped all over it. According to the hotel where the meeting was held, media ALMOST outnumbered NRA for the meeting. There is a side by side comparison of moores version of the speech and the actual transcript of the speech at http://www.hardylaw.net/Bowlingtranscript.html Yes, but a much larger problem with other types of preventable injuries/deaths. Nope, not in the movie. JUst an interesting lie. I also wish more research would be done on this. Philisophical difference, I suppose. My mother was big on ""Not telling the whole truth is the same as a lie"". I agree. I don;t think the message was an anti gun one overall. It almost seems like he started out to make on movie and ended up making another. Like I said before, what offended me was not so much the content of the film as the ws he carried it out. I expect a documentary to be big on facts and historical documentation (or, at least, will someday be historical documentation). Instead we got edited speeches and skewed perspective. The purpose of a documentary, to my mind, is to document. Documeting means showing things as they are, not editing them to make them fit your agenda. I was also very disturbed by the lengths he went to to portray the NRA, and Heston in particular, as callous extremists when this simply is not the case. It also angered me that he attempted to associate the NRA with the KKK, and portray heston as a racist. You are talking about a man who worked for Martin Luther King! The NRA elected Grant as their president after he was prsident of the united states. This is the same President Grant that suspended Habeus Corpus and deployed troops to fight the KKK. If moore can't tell it like it is and make his point, I think he seriously needs to re-examine his convictions, as they ar obviously flawed. There is page at http://www.hardylaw.net/Truth_About_Bowling.html that has a critique of bowling that is worth reading. It is well documented and provides links to pertinent informations. They make the point that Moores reply to the criticism of his work focuses on a few points, but leaves much to be desired.","bowling-columbine","03:25 AM","government-debates","13"
