"03-15-2003","373",2,"None","None","None","Broker","4865","Well, look at everything. Clinton was about to go in with no vote from Congress, no vote at the UN, and no one on the left complained. They were all pro war. Now that changed. You'd think that they wouldn't file a suit against Clinton, but they did, so there was no hypocrisy. That's a good thing though...","stupid-idiots-sue-president-over-war-iraq","11:11 PM","government-debates","22"

"06-29-2003","373",2,"None","None","None","Morfos","11269","Oh! so all people against the war in Iraq are now stupid? You *******, we aren't stupid, go to a University and tell them that. Most people at UCSD are against the war. Are they all XXXXXX? According to you they are. According to you, ""all Liberals are XXXXXX"". Even though those with PHDs tend to be Liberal and Anti-War, you continue to say how stupid all of us are for disagreeing with something Bush did. If Clinton fought the same war, you would be against it. Its just because Bush is a Republican you like this war. Oh well, continue to believe everything Rush Limbaugh tells you, continue to believe that Liberals are a bunch of XXXXXX, continue to believe anti-war protesters are pro-Saddam, since that seems to be what most Conservatives as yourself do best. BTW, You think we are stupid because we are the ""minority"". You think you are correct because you are the ""majority"". But really, we are the majority, you are the minority. In the other counties, most people are against the war! Blair's approval rating droped by 30% when he declared this war. However you continue to act like your the majority and that you are right, and that all other countries' medias are biased against us. You act like America is always right. You call us idiotic Saddam lovers, tell that to the whole world jerk.","stupid-idiots-sue-president-over-war-iraq","07:23 PM","government-debates","26"
"06-29-2003","373",2,"None","None","None","Broker","11277","I think I should point out that most of us probably supported Clinton's wars... I did, and I would. People can only name one Republican who was against Clinton's wars and for this one... Where did you find out that people with PhDs tend to be against the war? Why do you assume that we listen to Rush? I don't... Where did you get that number? 55% of Britons approved of the war right before it began... I highly doubt his approval rating was that low.","stupid-idiots-sue-president-over-war-iraq","08:41 PM","government-debates","27"
