I'm going to work hard and I'm going to build myself a huge house and buy a hybrid car and you aren't going to stop me. I want nice things. The poor guy might want nice things, but he didn't work hard in school and he wouldn't commit himself to working through college. His fault, not mine. I'm going to laugh at him as I drive by in my hybrid car into the gates of my mansion. I worked hard for all of this. You have done nothing and have almost nothing. Not my fault. Tell me that's mean, but it's true.","capitalism-socialism","11:17 PM","government-debates","16"

Re-education by the Department of Big Business? Concentratlion camps? Oh what the h*ll, there won't be very many people like Falling after we brainwash them and tell them that socialism is bad, just shoot them and burry them in a secret ditch. No one will miss them. Kelvin is that your vision of social justice? by the way, i know what your response is going to be. you are going to say that capitalists have never committed these crimes. but have you ever heard of the Red Scare or the McCarthy Trials? these were all capitalist ways to silence and ""re-educate"" socialists. for the last century, public schools have preached against socialism and have brainwashed our youth. you guys have already done the same exact thing that you accuse socialists of doing.","capitalism-socialism","12:08 AM","government-debates","18"

"02-05-2003","104",2,"None","None","None","Broker","989","I'd love to pay teachers more, but with what money? You're going to work for the government. Government pays a lot less. I will work in the private sector with a company generating millions of dollars and we can set high salaries and get big bonuses if we do well with the company.","capitalism-socialism","10:34 AM","government-debates","20"
"02-05-2003","104",2,"None","None","None","fallingupwards","991","""always with the spending complaints from some teachers..."" broker, if businessmen were only getting paid 35,000 a year dont you think they would complain too? TEACHERS HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO COMPLAIN. i know what i'm getting myself into. i'm never going to make much money. but at the same time, i would like to make enough to at least support a family off my income. what is wrong with that??? schools have been preaching against socialism and communism since the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. it is a fact. all of my economics classes are very hardcore capitalist. they all say that we should abolish the minimum wage, not save money (because that means we arent spending it), and abolish all taxes. our schools are very right-wing. once again i ask you about the Red Scare and the McCarthy Trials. these are just a few examples of capitalists persecuting socialists and communists for their ideas. capitalists are trying to ""re-educate"" these radicals on a daily basis in our schools. look around you!! there are corporations everywhere. our schools all say that anything other than capitalism is evil. THEY are the ones trying to ""re-educate"" those who think differently. was it Jesus who said ""dont try to remove the speck in your neighbor's eye when you have a plank in your own eye.""? or something like that. anyway, you get my point.","capitalism-socialism","10:49 AM","government-debates","21"
"02-05-2003","104",2,"None","None","None","Broker","1003","Abolish all taxes? Who is calling for that? That would be stupid. Abolish the minimum wage? This is a pure capitalist agenda, which is simply insane. There is no such things as 100% communist, socialist, or capitalist government. I have never heard anyone in the school system ever call for a pure capitalist system. What do you have against corporations? US coroporations make the world go, period. Corporations give billions and billions to charities...them or their executives. Bill Gates created a 1 billion scholarship fund for to help those who couldn't afford College, and Microsoft sponsers the Duke TIP and many other educational programs. That is just one example! On spending complaints I was talking about budget manners. Two of my teachers go on and on complaining about why we should ro shouldn't do this or that. They have every right to complain about their salaries.","capitalism-socialism","12:07 PM","government-debates","22"
"02-05-2003","104",2,"None","None","None","fallingupwards","1020","if we have every right to complain about our salaries, then stop trying to censor us. another example of capitalists trying to ""re-educate"" and censor our teachers is the fact that teacher unions are outlawed. that is ridiculous. basketball and football players even have unions and collective bargaining groups. but teachers cannot. broker, you are not a true capitalist. i can also tell that you are very young and have not been in school long enough to know what higher level classes teach. you are not enrolled in a unversity are you? well i am, so i should know what they teach. the economics textbook that we are assigned is 100% capitalist. the two separate economics teachers that i have had went supported what the book said 100%. THIS IS WHAT HIGHER LEVEL ECONOMICS CLASSES ARE TELLING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY: 1. Abolish all taxes. why? because taxes are an inefficient use of resources and take money from businesses. 2. Abolish the minimum wage. why? because unemployment will decrease and businesses will make more profit. 3. Dont save money. why? because if you save money, then that is an inefficient use of resources as well. you should be spending all of your money so that it goes to businesses and the economy. 4. Abolish all tariffs. why? because then corporations can move their factories overseas (and as a result have high unemployment in manufacturing sections of the country). i will give you my source for this information. it is from Michael Parkin's Economics (Fifth Edition). how much more evidence do you need broker? minimum wage is a socialist idea. taxes are a socialist idea. got it? what do i have against corporations? well if you ever become an entreprenuer someday, you will have something against them too. corporations have taken over our country and as a result, small businesses (both sole proprietorships and partnerships) are very very unlikely to ever be successful. i dont have a problem with small business at all. in fact, i really like small business. but corporations drown all of these small businesses out. corporations also go into foreign countries and spread western culture, at the expense of that country's own unique culture. small businesses are good, corporations are not.","capitalism-socialism","03:32 PM","government-debates","23"
"02-05-2003","104",2,"None","None","None","Broker","1024","Around 50% of ALL small businesses sell to those big corporations only and never the public. You are in a university. If it is a public one, it is not wholly public. It does not mean all public institutions teach that, nor private ones, nor lower institutions. Can anyone here claim they like every single principal of one system? I consider myself capitalist because I lean toward that system. Of course we have incorporated ideas from other forms of government. This is not a pure capitalist system and it will never be one. This is a mix leaning toward capitalism. Sweden is capitalist in economic matters...you refer to that country all the time, so so will I. Teacher unions can be a very, very dangerous thing. They can't just walk off the job until they get higher pay. Local governments would just lower substitute teacher requirements and replace as many as they could for even less money and they would not be qualified to teach everyone. Teachers know the salaries are low, so they know what they are getting into. They can still make a difference in private institutions, which will pay higher.","capitalism-socialism","03:53 PM","government-debates","24"

You can't have an economics class where one system is taught as being the best and only way to do things. Any judge in their right kind would order that institution to change or lose federal funding.
