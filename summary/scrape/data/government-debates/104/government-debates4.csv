"02-07-2003","104",4,"None","None","None","American","1339","Falling, But public education was existent in 1787 so even under Dsa's definition of the Tenth Amendment it was a right reserved to either the people or the States. The federal government has no business in education. If the federal government doesn't pay teachers, and it shouldn't, then the people who send their children to public school should. One of the major problems with socialism is found in an experience I had not too long ago. As I stood in line at a grocery store I noticed the people just in front of me shuffling through several cards, but not just any cards - these were walfare cards. I stood there and watched them pay for their groceries in disgust. I don't mind helping the needy, but when it is forced on me by the government I get mad. If the people had just turned around and asked if I could help them pay for their groceries I would have been more than happy to, but such was not the case. This is the effects of socialism in their true state, and I am one who does not wish that on anyone.","capitalism-socialism","08:46 PM","government-debates","47"

"02-07-2003","104",4,"None","None","None","American","1341","Falling, You missed the whole point of my story. I was not disgusted at the poor people I was disgusted at the government under a socialist mindset. I love poor people, heck I was one for a while (and really kinda still am). The families paying the teachers is certainly better than the federal government doing so. The Constitution is the ""supreme law of the land"" and as such should be followed in all circumstances. I would go for the State governments paying the teachers just so long as it took it out of the hands of the federal government, where it doesn't belong. There is an old maxim, ""You tax what you want less of, and subsidize what you want less of."" Under this principle the federal government wants more poor people because it is taxing incomes and subsidizing welfare, and it is a socialistic philosophy that is behind this action.","capitalism-socialism","09:00 PM","government-debates","49"

We should be more like Japan with education.","capitalism-socialism","11:31 PM","government-debates","53"

Falling, Let the State government take care of the poor families if you just have to have governmental involvment, but my personal opinion is that the church should be providing for the needy, education is included.","capitalism-socialism","01:59 AM","government-debates","54"

"02-08-2003","104",4,"None","None","None","Broker","1395","The church? When did you arrive at that? There was going to be a nice increase in teacher salaries down here, but that class size amendment passed...it's great to want smaller classes, but we will have to double the number of classrooms and double the number of teachers. Pay here will only go down because of that stupid choice, which most students actually opposed. I would love to pay teachers more...but here they're going to be getting even less because of votes who didn't know the huge cost of the plan.","capitalism-socialism","11:07 AM","government-debates","56"
"02-08-2003","104",4,"None","None","None","American","1414","Falling, If the church decides to open a private affiliated school to educate its members kids I would have no problem with that, but when I said ""that the church should be providing for the needy"" I was mainly talking about financial assitance. Muslims have their mosks, Jews their tabernacles, and Atheists the State. Everyone can be helped, but that help should not come from the Federal Government, it is a violation of the Constitution and it is socialism that drives the Federal Government to provide for such things.","capitalism-socialism","03:37 PM","government-debates","57"
"02-08-2003","104",4,"None","None","None","fallingupwards","1419","broker, if we raise teacher salaries then the number of teachers in the field will automatically increase. and as a result of that, classrooms will be smaller. and as a result of smaller classrooms, you could probably be in a more ""advanced"" setting and not feel like you're so far ahead of everyone else. american, if the church ALONE provides for the needy, then there is bound to be discrimination. a starving christian will PROBABLY receive food before a starving muslim. i'm not saying in all cases, but in some. not to mention that the church does not have all that money. churches can barely make enough money to pay for their building, much less provide alot of money to the poor. the government meanwhile is filthy rich and can afford to help the poor. why are you so OBSESSED with the constitution??? i swear, if the constitution said pigs could fly, you would insist that its true. forget what the constitution says. it was written over two centuries ago. we dont need to be bound by a 214 year old document.","capitalism-socialism","03:59 PM","government-debates","58"
