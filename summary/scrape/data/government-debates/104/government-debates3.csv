"02-05-2003","104",3,"None","None","None","fallingupwards","1089","why do i prefer socialism over capitalism? i would like to break it down into three sections: economic reasons, humanitarian reasons, and religious reasons. Economic reason: utility theory teaches us that it is more economically efficient if we divide the wealth more equally. one dollar is worth more to a poor person than it is to a rich person, correct? no one can deny that fact. one dollar is not worth as much to a rich person as it is to a poor person. therefore, if we distribute the wealth more equally, we will be using our resources MORE EFFICIENTLY by giving it to those who value them the most. Humanitarian reason: socialism is clearly more moral than capitalism. have you ever heard of that saying: ""money is the root of all evil""? well, money is the foundation of capitalism. that should tell you a lot about capitalism. lets look at this logically: 1. money is the root of all evil 2. money is the foundation of capitalism 3. therefore, capitalism is evil another reason to dislike capitalism from a humanitarian standpoint is the fact that ONE PERCENT OF OUR NATION OWNS HALF OF THE TOTAL WEALTH. how is that moral? how is that ethical? i'm not saying that everyone should get paid the same amount. but the wealth needs to be distributed more equally. you should get paid according to how much work and effort you put into a job. in this case, teachers would make the same amount as most businessmen. also, PURE capitalists believe that the minimum wage should be abolished. this is very very very unethical and immoral. Religious reason: being a Christian, religion is obviously very important to me and is reason enough to believe that one system is better than the other. this might not be the case for you guys (i dont know if you're a Christian or not). but nonetheless, it is very important to me. Jesus taught over and over again that the rich should share their wealth with the poor. he said this through parables and the beatitudes and many other instances. it is quite clear that Jesus had compassion on the poor. MOST (and notice i did not say all) rich people do not share a lot of their money with the poor, relative to how much they really make. therefore, since the rich are not giving to the poor as much as they should, we need government to redistribute the wealth for them. if the rich gave enough to the poor, then we wouldnt have this problem. but they dont. we need government.","capitalism-socialism","11:50 PM","government-debates","31"
"02-06-2003","104",3,"None","None","None","American","1095","Falling, I will follow your three points. Thx for answering the question without the arguments (which I now expect to hear ) Economic Reasons: It goes unquestioned that a dollar is valued more highly by a poor person than a rich (and I speak from having been on both sides of the spectrum). I will not agrue with these reasons as you have presented them. Humanitarian Reasons: I will point out here that it is ""the LOVE of money is the root of all evil."" Capitialism is based on freedom, not money. Capitialism stands for the idea that a man should be able to work and earn money and spend his money as he sees fit (at least that is how this capitialist sees it). I agree that a person should get paid for how hard he works. If you don't show up, you don't get paid (that's at least one problem with unions, but has nothing to do with this debate). Capitialism allows for bargining and compromise. If I bid on a job at XYZ, Inc. and Joe's Services bids $5 lower, a Capitialist society allows me to bargin and try to win the contract. If 1% of the populace controls 50% of the wealth, it probably means that the 1% was willing to sacrifice and work their backsides off for years in order to become wealthy (of course some people get wealthy through other means). Religious Reasons: In Genesis 3:19 we read, ""In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread..."" Notice that it is God talking and he says that Adam is to work for his own bread, not for Joe XXXX's bread (not that there was a Joe XXXX to give it to). Also notice where Christ placed the emphasis during His earthly ministry. He blessed the widow who gave her last farthings to the church. He told the rich man to ""go sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor."" Never once will you find Christ saying that the government is to be the distributor of help to the needy. It is always the people or the church that God used to care for the ""fatherless and widow in their affliction."" It is my view that we don't need more government to help us solve the problem, we need less government. If the government were to stop being ""god"" in this country I think the number of will Joe Blows would skyrocket, and all the Billy Boys would be cared for quite nicely. Also remember that it is the duty of the church to care for the needy, not just the Joe Blows.","capitalism-socialism","12:25 AM","government-debates","32"
"02-06-2003","104",3,"None","None","None","fallingupwards","1098","so you agree that equal work should receive equal pay? just to let you know, most corporate executives cringe everytime they hear ""radical"" ideas like that. i dont deny that most businessmen worked very hard (although some inherited their money). but at the same time, they should not be getting paid millions (or even billions) of dollars for their work, while someone who put just as much effort and sacrifice get paid in dogfood. these include police officers, teachers, firemen, and people in the military. these people have also ""sacrificed"" and ""worked their backsides off for years"". yet they are lucky to make one tenth as much as just a common businessman who works for a corporation. what proof do you have that the number of Joe Blows will skyrocket if we have less government? we had less government in the 19th century and you didnt see rich people giving a lot of money to the poor. if the rich do not obey Christ's commands, then the government should step in. what would God rather see: hardly anyone obeying his commands and little government, or a strong government enforcing his commands? the Bible says that murder and theft are wrong, correct? but we still have the government to ENFORCE these laws. in the same way, we need government to enforce what Christ commanded the wealthy to do, because most of them will not do it on their own.","capitalism-socialism","01:07 AM","government-debates","33"
"02-06-2003","104",3,"None","None","None","Broker","1108","The government can't afford to start doubling salaries. Private sector pays more the public sector, period. Businessman push millions of dollars around. Salaries are based on company performance. If they get revenues up 20%, they can expect a pay raise with it. That's why they make all the money...they make all the decisions that make the money. What company pays their executives billions of dollars? If people want more pay they should prepare to enter the private sector instead of the public sector.","capitalism-socialism","07:58 AM","government-debates","34"
"02-06-2003","104",3,"None","None","None","fallingupwards","1110","you say the government cannot afford to start doubling salaries. EXACTLY MY POINT, so we need to tax the rich more so that we can afford to pay those salaries. common businessmen do not need to be multi-billionaires while teachers, police officers, firemen, and soldiers make next to nothing. EQUAL WORK FOR EQUAL PAY. what is wrong with that broker??? are you scared at the prospect of corporations sharing their precious precious money with those in need who work just as hard (if not harder). last time i checked, businessmen were not educating our youth like our teachers do. last time i checked, businessmen were not putting their lives on the line EVERY SINGLE DAY AT WORK like police officers, firemen and soldiers do. broker, you act like anyone who goes to college for four years will automatically become a millionaire because of their hard work. well, you got the hard work part right, but not the millionaire part. the hardest working people in this country make the least money. its been like that for years and years. you are a very very unrealistic person broker. not everyone has the opportunity to be a multi-millionaire but you act like they do.

"02-06-2003","104",3,"None","None","None","American","1122","Falling, Economic Reasons: Yes, I believe in the ""no work, no pay"" idea, and I don't care what anyone, let alone some bigshot executive, thinks. About the teachers, my grandmother (who lost her husband in Sept.) retired last summer. She worked in the same classroom for a ton of years (I forget how many at the moment, something like 30), and now she is able to support herself because she was careful to save for her retirement (""support"" here includes trips to Europe and the like). Many teacher's problem is that they have joined a union and therefore cannot decide for themselves, where they will work, how many hours they will work, what their pay will be. One of the beauties of a Capitialist society is that the individual person is able to decide for himself what course he will take. I have choosen to be a small business owner for the time being, my grandmother chose to be a teacher, and we are both paid for the amount of time we work(ed). The prices may vary but the principle is the same: If you are willing to work, sometimes long and hard hours, you will be sucessful, whether you started out rich or poor makes little difference. Religious Reasons: My proof comes from firsthand knowledge of 100s if not 1000s of Joes who have the money to help a Billy but don't because the felt that the government would provide for them anyway. Yes, the Bible says that murder and theft are wrong, but notice that both are within the legitimate authority of a government according to Romans 13. It is not the job of the government to make sure that everyone is perfectly equal, such a goal is impossible to reach so long as there are people willing to think for themselves.","capitalism-socialism","02:31 PM","government-debates","36"

(and broker, please do not give me that lame saying that ""life isnt fair"". just because life isnt fair doesnt mean that we shouldnt strive to make it less unfair.) i never said that it is the government's job to make everyone perfectly equal. i did say that it is the government's job to look after its citizens and to try to make things less unfair","capitalism-socialism","03:47 PM","government-debates","39"

I don't like how socialism is always interfering with business (though I plan to enter the field, so...)! I can't stand government bailouts, which I would think you would oppose, and socialist governments are ALWAYS bailing out big business. Perfect example is Germany. The bailed everyone out whenever it was needed and they can't afford it now... crashing.","capitalism-socialism","06:12 PM","government-debates","40"
