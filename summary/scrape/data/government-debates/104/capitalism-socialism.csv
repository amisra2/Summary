THIS IS WHAT HIGHER LEVEL ECONOMICS CLASSES ARE TELLING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY: 1. Abolish all taxes. why? because taxes are an inefficient use of resources and take money from businesses. 2. Abolish the minimum wage. why? because unemployment will decrease and businesses will make more profit. 3. Dont save money. why? because if you save money, then that is an inefficient use of resources as well. you should be spending all of your money so that it goes to businesses and the economy. 4. Abolish all tariffs. why? because then corporations can move their factories overseas (and as a result have high unemployment in manufacturing sections of the country). i will give you my source for this information. it is from Michael Parkin's Economics (Fifth Edition). how much more evidence do you need broker? minimum wage is a socialist idea. taxes are a socialist idea. got it? what do i have against corporations? well if you ever become an entreprenuer someday, you will have something against them too. corporations have taken over our country and as a result, small businesses (both sole proprietorships and partnerships) are very very unlikely to ever be successful. i dont have a problem with small business at all. in fact, i really like small business. but corporations drown all of these small businesses out. corporations also go into foreign countries and spread western culture, at the expense of that country's own unique culture. small businesses are good, corporations are not.","capitalism-socialism","03:32 PM","government-debates","23"

Sweden is capitalist in economic matters...you refer to that country all the time, so so will I. Teacher unions can be a very, very dangerous thing. They can't just walk off the job until they get higher pay. Local governments would just lower substitute teacher requirements and replace as many as they could for even less money and they would not be qualified to teach everyone.

"02-05-2003","104",3,"None","None","None","fallingupwards","1089","why do i prefer socialism over capitalism? i would like to break it down into three sections: economic reasons, humanitarian reasons, and religious reasons. Economic reason: utility theory teaches us that it is more economically efficient if we divide the wealth more equally. one dollar is worth more to a poor person than it is to a rich person, correct? no one can deny that fact. one dollar is not worth as much to a rich person as it is to a poor person. therefore, if we distribute the wealth more equally, we will be using our resources MORE EFFICIENTLY by giving it to those who value them the most. Humanitarian reason: socialism is clearly more moral than capitalism. have you ever heard of that saying: ""money is the root of all evil""? well, money is the foundation of capitalism. that should tell you a lot about capitalism. lets look at this logically: 1. money is the root of all evil 2. money is the foundation of capitalism 3. therefore, capitalism is evil another reason to dislike capitalism from a humanitarian standpoint is the fact that ONE PERCENT OF OUR NATION OWNS HALF OF THE TOTAL WEALTH. how is that moral? how is that ethical? i'm not saying that everyone should get paid the same amount. but the wealth needs to be distributed more equally. you should get paid according to how much work and effort you put into a job. in this case, teachers would make the same amount as most businessmen. also, PURE capitalists believe that the minimum wage should be abolished. this is very very very unethical and immoral. Religious reason: being a Christian, religion is obviously very important to me and is reason enough to believe that one system is better than the other. this might not be the case for you guys (i dont know if you're a Christian or not). but nonetheless, it is very important to me. Jesus taught over and over again that the rich should share their wealth with the poor. he said this through parables and the beatitudes and many other instances. it is quite clear that Jesus had compassion on the poor. MOST (and notice i did not say all) rich people do not share a lot of their money with the poor, relative to how much they really make. therefore, since the rich are not giving to the poor as much as they should, we need government to redistribute the wealth for them. if the rich gave enough to the poor, then we wouldnt have this problem. but they dont. we need government.","capitalism-socialism","11:50 PM","government-debates","31"
"02-06-2003","104",3,"None","None","None","American","1095","Falling, I will follow your three points. Thx for answering the question without the arguments (which I now expect to hear ) Economic Reasons: It goes unquestioned that a dollar is valued more highly by a poor person than a rich (and I speak from having been on both sides of the spectrum). I will not agrue with these reasons as you have presented them. Humanitarian Reasons: I will point out here that it is ""the LOVE of money is the root of all evil."" Capitialism is based on freedom, not money. Capitialism stands for the idea that a man should be able to work and earn money and spend his money as he sees fit (at least that is how this capitialist sees it). I agree that a person should get paid for how hard he works. If you don't show up, you don't get paid (that's at least one problem with unions, but has nothing to do with this debate). Capitialism allows for bargining and compromise. If I bid on a job at XYZ, Inc. and Joe's Services bids $5 lower, a Capitialist society allows me to bargin and try to win the contract. If 1% of the populace controls 50% of the wealth, it probably means that the 1% was willing to sacrifice and work their backsides off for years in order to become wealthy (of course some people get wealthy through other means). Religious Reasons: In Genesis 3:19 we read, ""In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread..."" Notice that it is God talking and he says that Adam is to work for his own bread, not for Joe XXXX's bread (not that there was a Joe XXXX to give it to). Also notice where Christ placed the emphasis during His earthly ministry. He blessed the widow who gave her last farthings to the church. He told the rich man to ""go sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor."" Never once will you find Christ saying that the government is to be the distributor of help to the needy. It is always the people or the church that God used to care for the ""fatherless and widow in their affliction."" It is my view that we don't need more government to help us solve the problem, we need less government. If the government were to stop being ""god"" in this country I think the number of will Joe Blows would skyrocket, and all the Billy Boys would be cared for quite nicely. Also remember that it is the duty of the church to care for the needy, not just the Joe Blows.","capitalism-socialism","12:25 AM","government-debates","32"
"02-06-2003","104",3,"None","None","None","fallingupwards","1098","so you agree that equal work should receive equal pay? just to let you know, most corporate executives cringe everytime they hear ""radical"" ideas like that. i dont deny that most businessmen worked very hard (although some inherited their money). but at the same time, they should not be getting paid millions (or even billions) of dollars for their work, while someone who put just as much effort and sacrifice get paid in dogfood. these include police officers, teachers, firemen, and people in the military. these people have also ""sacrificed"" and ""worked their backsides off for years"". yet they are lucky to make one tenth as much as just a common businessman who works for a corporation. what proof do you have that the number of Joe Blows will skyrocket if we have less government? we had less government in the 19th century and you didnt see rich people giving a lot of money to the poor. if the rich do not obey Christ's commands, then the government should step in. what would God rather see: hardly anyone obeying his commands and little government, or a strong government enforcing his commands? the Bible says that murder and theft are wrong, correct? but we still have the government to ENFORCE these laws. in the same way, we need government to enforce what Christ commanded the wealthy to do, because most of them will not do it on their own.","capitalism-socialism","01:07 AM","government-debates","33"

About the teachers, my grandmother (who lost her husband in Sept.) retired last summer. She worked in the same classroom for a ton of years (I forget how many at the moment, something like 30), and now she is able to support herself because she was careful to save for her retirement (""support"" here includes trips to Europe and the like). Many teacher's problem is that they have joined a union and therefore cannot decide for themselves, where they will work, how many hours they will work, what their pay will be. One of the beauties of a Capitialist society is that the individual person is able to decide for himself what course he will take. I have choosen to be a small business owner for the time being, my grandmother chose to be a teacher, and we are both paid for the amount of time we work(ed). The prices may vary but the principle is the same: If you are willing to work, sometimes long and hard hours, you will be sucessful, whether you started out rich or poor makes little difference. Religious Reasons: My proof comes from firsthand knowledge of 100s if not 1000s of Joes who have the money to help a Billy but don't because the felt that the government would provide for them anyway. Yes, the Bible says that murder and theft are wrong, but notice that both are within the legitimate authority of a government according to Romans 13.

I was just wanting to add my own comments, and hopefully cause some people to think critically about some of the issues brought up...I had to put two posts for character limit. fallingupwards made a post: >why do i prefer socialism over capitalism? i would like to break it down into three sections: economic reasons, humanitarian reasons, and religious reasons. Given this opening, what follows then is not a summary of facts why socialism is superior to capitalism, but why one individual FEELS that it is better. >Economic reason: utility theory teaches us that it is more economically efficient if we divide the wealth more equally. one dollar is worth more to a poor person than it is to a rich person, correct? no one can deny that fact. one dollar is not worth as much to a rich person as it is to a poor person. therefore, if we distribute the wealth more equally, we will be using our resources MORE EFFICIENTLY by giving it to those who value them the most. I would like some more explanation of this. It sounds as if the reasoning for taking a dollar from a richer person, and giving it to a poorer person originates in the idea that a poorer person will utilize the dollar in a more productive fashion (more utility) than a richer person. The cases can be made on both sides here. One side would say that the rich person will spend the dollar on a cigar and burn it up while the poorer person will buy essentials. The other side says that the rich person will invest the dollar to produce and the poorer will buy booze. I would like to know how the mere act of re-distribution solidifies the former of the two scenarios as the result. The obvious conclusion is that the poorer must be in a position that essentials are not provided by their own income. If this is the case, our modern (not pure) system of capitalism temporarily provides, through public and private channels, for essentials, to people unable to obtain them on their own. The current system is set up to help people provide for themselves and eventually become a supplier of essentials for others and so on and so forth. This system is in place and practical today. In the socialist practice, which is historically different than the socialist theory, essentials are provided by re-distribution of wealth, which causes a decrease in over-all production - Soviet Union, North Korea, et all. The effects are that the poorer become equal with the rich, and productivity decreases, causing a stagnated growth in utility. So while everyone in a socialist system has the same utility, over time that utility is exponentially smaller than even the lowest levels of utility caused by the modified capitalist system. One way to look at it is...over time, socialistic systems increase productivity very slowly for all peoples equally. Capitalistic systems increase productivity at huge rates, first for those able to benefit the most (the wealthy) and then later for those who did not have sufficient investment in the system to benefit (the poor). Think of the cost of living in America. Essentials AND amenities have become cheap enough that the poor, while very far below the standards of the rich, or very far above the standard of the poor 75 years ago. Conversly, those 75 years were all it took for practical socialism to crumple and fall, destroying both rich and poor alike in the Soviet Union. >Humanitarian reason: socialism is clearly more moral than capitalism. have you ever heard of that saying: ""money is the root of all evil""? well, money is the foundation of capitalism. that should tell you a lot about capitalism. lets look at this logically: 1. money is the root of all evil 2. money is the foundation of capitalism 3. therefore, capitalism is evil another reason to dislike capitalism from a humanitarian standpoint is the fact that ONE PERCENT OF OUR NATION OWNS HALF OF THE TOTAL WEALTH. how is that moral? how is that ethical? i'm not saying that everyone should get paid the same amount. but the wealth needs to be distributed more equally. you should get paid according to how much work and effort you put into a job. in this case, teachers would make the same amount as most businessmen. also, PURE capitalists believe that the minimum wage should be abolished. this is very very very unethical and immoral. This assertion is as illogical as the notion that your statements are the ""facts"" the show socialism superior to capitalism. Although I do share the sentiment that it is very sad that 1% of the nation owns 50% of the wealth, and it is perhaps un-ethical, that does not mean that the fault lies in the wealthy. Too often arguments like this one, which is premised on an incorrect logical process, are used in a sort of class-warfare argument against capitalism. The wealth is there, wether it is in the hands of the wealthy or the poor. As previously noted, maximum utility is not a foregon result of redistribution of wealth. Because, thank God, all peoples have free will and choice to do with our posessions as we will. However, where class warfare loses its substance is in the underlying notion that the wealthy attempt to prevent the poor from progressing into the wealthy ""class"" on such false ""facts"" that the wealthy just don't want competition. It is true that devices like Monopolies benefit from being the ""King-of-the-Mountain,"" but these devices are regulated and not allowed in our, note again, MODERN, NON-PURE, PRACTICAL capitalistic system. There are still some missing regulations to prevent the wealthy from using their power to suppress the poor...an immoral and un-ethical action, yes. But the idea that merely because the wealthy are wealthy, the system is un-ethical is as baseless as the logical process you presented. The premise of your argument is that ""money is the root of all evil."" I think someone censored your Bible, because mine reads, in Timothy 6:10 ""For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows."" Note that the LOVE OF money is the root of all evil. The love of money is akin to the act of the wealthy hording money and preventing the poor from attaining it. This scripture tell us that this action is immoral, erring from the faith. This is true. So, regulations should be in place to stop the wealthy from preventing the poor to attain wealth, but that is not the same as regulations which re-distribute the wealth blatantly, which itself is an immoral act. Wether you take my money, or the government took my money to give to you, it was still stealing. I would rather give of my own accord to help my fellow man, because it is not only moral, but righteous.","capitalism-socialism","01:29 PM","government-debates","71"
"03-22-2003","104",5,"None","None","None","lukecrouch","5358",">Religious reason: being a Christian, religion is obviously very important to me and is reason enough to believe that one system is better than the other. this might not be the case for you guys (i dont know if you're a Christian or not). but nonetheless, it is very important to me. Jesus taught over and over again that the rich should share their wealth with the poor. he said this through parables and the beatitudes and many other instances. it is quite clear that Jesus had compassion on the poor. MOST (and notice i did not say all) rich people do not share a lot of their money with the poor, relative to how much they really make. therefore, since the rich are not giving to the poor as much as they should, we need government to redistribute the wealth for them. if the rich gave enough to the poor, then we wouldnt have this problem. but they dont. we need government. I am a Christian too. I very passionately support the idea of giving to the needy. Jesus Christ, our Saviour and our example which we should all strive to live like, was infallible, without sin, the Son of God. Our government, which has brutally construed the idea of seperation of Church and state, is in no way infallible, and is more sinful than any thousands of humans could ever be. The Bible teaches that we are to strive to be as Jesus was and is. In light of this, I think our (those of us striving for righteousness) responsibility should be left to us, and not passed on to the government. My case on this was solidifed when I saw the work of a publicly-funded artist(being supported by a government program for artists). All of his work was sacreligous and one item was a sculpture of Christ on the cross...upside down in a large vat of real urine. We DON'T need government. We need people to have compassion, reason and accounability. Your case that very few rich share their money with the poor is very valid, and I share it and condemn those that horde money and live lavishly while others struggle for necessities. However, I believe legislation should exist so that those that ARE charitable can have less taken from them by the government. This would be a better way to encourage those that are wealthy that giving is beneficial, rather than just encouraging the cycle that seems to be these peoples' minds. IE: I make a lot of money, government takes much more, so I need to make much more, government takes more etc. etc. I forget the scripture now, and cannot find it(if you can, please let me know) that reads: [paraphrasing] ""The task of the righteous man is to serve God and to give openly, the task of the un-righteous is to horde wealth to give it up to the righteous man."" I don't know about you, but I would rather exist in a system where the righteous are allowed to profit freely while still serving God and able (and hopefully willing) to give. In this regard, many, if not all, historical socialistic systems have been secularized, not allowing the notion of God on the premise that the being of God is impossible according to dialectic philosophy. So the government, historically corrupt, plays the role of God - determining what is righteous and what is true - according to the needs of society. Even the socialists recognize the idea that society needs God, but they attempt to play the role, rather than let individuals strive for the role and exemplify righteousness to each other. While I don't believe our system is infallible, I believe it is far superiour to socialism, by the arguments I have laid out. Please let me know your feelings on these issues.","capitalism-socialism","01:29 PM","government-debates","72"

"03-23-2003","104",6,"None","None","None","lukecrouch","5405","I would also like to address a common statistic used to demonstrate that capitalism only helps the richest. http://www.armory.com/~rstevew/WealthDist_TheNation.pdf The statistic I found was that in 1998, the richest 1% of the population owned 38.1% of the wealth. If someone else can post a more current statistic, please do so...it does not matter, as this statistic is irrelevant based on the observations below: The ""wealth"" of this study is explicitly stated to include ALL assets like houses, bank accounts, and (this one is very important) stock portfolios. A stock portfolio, remember, contains all market assets like mutual funds, index funds, and stocks of individual companies. Now, Let's take a hypothetical example of a billionare like Warren Buffet...whose ""wealth"" fluctuates with the market, but is stated to be near 30 billion. (A nice note about this guy: His ""value investing"" style mirrors his lifestyle and overall philosophy on life: he doesn't live in a huge house, he doesn't collect cars, and he doesn't take a limousine to work. In fact, ""The Oracle of Omaha"" lives in the same house he once bought for $31,500. Wish he could teach the Hollywood elitist liberals a thing or two.) A man like Warren Buffet is worth 30 billion, but remember that this worth is houses (apparently 31,500), bank accounts, and stock portfolio. Let's say the house value is essentially nothing. So his 30 billion is split between bank accounts and stock assets, maybe 50/50. (Although I doubt a man with the investment genius like Buffet has anything less than 80% in stocks). 50% of 30 billion is 15 billion. In stocks. Stocks like Coca Cola, American Express, and Gilette. Last year, Coca Cola spent $7 billion dollars in expenses. Do you know where that $7 billion goes? Into the pockets of employees, to small business that sell them bottling equipment, and to their various franchises and subsidiaries. Gilette spent $7.2 billion. And American Express spent $21 billion in the same way. As an owner of stock in these companies, Buffet owns percentages of the company. A man like Buffet can own a powerful 5-10% even. So, if Buffet is forced to give a percentage of his wealth away, that means he has to liquidate some of it, sell stock. He looks and sees that his Coca Cola stock is the least impressive, so he sells his 5% of it to pay for the ""tax""/""robbery"". 5% of $7 billion = $350 million. I hope you're going to explain to those employees and suppliers of Coca Cola why it is your taking $350 million away from them. If this money were put to welfare, you are essentially laying off employees and taking away business from other suppliers (who may, in turn, have to lay off employees), to give money to the un-employed, of which you have now created more. So now welfare is again inadequate and the cycle has to continue, until everyone is dependent on the government welfare checks, all of which are inadequate. But if you follow the fundamental capitalistic idea of ""You make what you earn for yourself"" everyone has their own power to raise or lower their income at their choosing. Some may have to work harder at it than others...but such is life. And even if it might hurt some peoples' feelings, it is the best thing to do.","capitalism-socialism","12:38 PM","government-debates","77"

Total income tax share (percentage) by highest wage-earners: Year: Total........Top 1%...Top 5%...Top 10%..Top 25%..Top 50% 1986: 100.00......25.75......42.57......54.69......76.02 ......93.54 1987: 100.00......24.81......43.26......55.61......76.92 ......93.93 1988: 100.00......27.58......45.62......57.28......77.84 ......94.28 1989: 100.00......25.24......43.94......55.78......77.22 ......94.17 1990: 100.00......25.13......43.64......55.36......77.02 ......94.19 1991: 100.00......24.82......43.38......55.82......77.29 ......94.52 1992: 100.00......27.54......45.88......58.01......78.48 ......94.94 1993: 100.00......29.01......47.36......59.24......79.27 ......95.19 1994: 100.00......28.86......47.52......59.45......79.55 ......95.23 1995: 100.00......30.26......48.91......60.75......80.36 ......95.39 1996: 100.00......32.31......50.97......62.51......81.32 ......95.68 1997: 100.00......33.17......51.87......63.20......81.67 ......95.72 1998: 100.00......34.75......53.84......65.04......82.69 ......95.79 1999: 100.00......36.18......55.45......66.45......83.54 ......96.00 2000: 100.00......37.42......56.47......67.33......84.01 ......96.09 As you can see, this shows that the top 1% of wage-earners pay 37.42% of taxes paid in this country. Taking that number to just the top 5% accounts for more than half of all income taxes paid. Keep in mind, this statistic differs from the 1% wealthiest because these are income tax numbers. So this top 5% is not necessarily the top 5% wealthiest people, but rather the top 5% of income earners. That's the working class...not the wealthy living off of their fully purchased assets. So, in the current tax system in America, you are punished for WORKING more, not necessarily for HAVING more. Starting to understand why we're called the lazy land of excess?","capitalism-socialism","10:01 AM","government-debates","80"

What is the GDP/citizen? China? $838/person. N. Korea? $900/person. Admittedly that is not ALL due to socialism, but a large part of it. In addition, explain to me the mistakes that were made during the communist revolutions in the countries like Soviet Union and China. More importantly explain to me (and write a book) the remedies to these problems? This is the main problem with many socialists. It's easy to support an idea that hasn't come to fruition. The blank page will never answer back to you. It also takes a very large amount of arrogance to assume that YOU understand Marxist socialism better than, say, the founders of the Soviet Union. Most socialists read the manifesto once, read a bunch of Hegel and conclude that they've got it all figured out. The good news for us capitalists is that we don't need to study socialism in depth to refute it. Because very intelligent people in other countries have already done so and brought about the death of socialism on their own - because even all these scholars put together couldn't create a viable working model of it. Socialism is nice on paper, but in the real world, it has no merit.","capitalism-socialism","11:36 AM","government-debates","84"

Now why would you ever have the motivation to become more than an average worker, a janitor, cashier, whatever, rather than a doctor, or a scientist. A doctor or a scientist takes years of study, dedication and hard work, anyone can be a cashier. So if a cashier makes the same as a teacher, or a doctor, or a scientist, why take the hard route? Human nature is what human nature is, and while I would like to believe that the majority of people are good, many who would be quite happy to suck of the system and do their meager amount of work and live as well as any other person. In socialism there is no motivation to succeed. There is no drive to better oneself because no matter what you do to improve your standing, you never improve your surroundings, lifestyle, or anything else. In a capitalist society the drive to succeed is everywhere. You want a better car? Get that raise by working harder and you can have it. Get that degree, work at the university you can have it. You want a house in the country so you can give your kid a pony that you always wished you could have, put that overtime in, keep your nose to the grindstone, show your boss what an asset you are and you can have it. You have an idea? Get a patent, start your own company and generations of your lineage can live quite nicely for the work you've put in. Why should the guy sitting on the porch doing nothing profit from your work when he's done nothing to better himself or add his knowledge to society? Capitalism forces people to excel. In such a society such as the US has is it any wonder why even the poor here live better than many rich in other countries?","capitalism-socialism","12:58 AM","government-debates","90"

I just wanted to briefly mention something that i havent seen mentioned here before. Aside from the most previous post, which i agree with fully, id like to add this: All one hears from those pushing socialism, communism etc, (sorry for the generalization) is that the wealth should be spread out evenly and accordingly. That the wealthy in the US are evil, and this extreme minority is stereotyped to be completely homogenous. To a certain extent I can understand how everyone plays an important role in society, and that perhaps not everyone is ""greedy"" and is only looking for a high paying job etc. but the point I am looking to make is: more often than not, in a capitalistic society, a simplistic approach to becoming successful and wealthy one makes sacrifices and in the process must take risk. Bear with me if this is not yet fully obvious and makes sense. i.e. (just some improvised examples thanks to what ive read on this forum so far) a person going into the vocation of a teacher must goto school, get an appropriate degree, etc etc. Its likely that getting hired should not be that difficult/ take that long, and he/she will recieve a steady wage and the teacher will not worry excessively that perhaps he/she wont get paid this week or whatnot. what I am trying to point out is that this lifestyle and furthermore transaction of monetary value is steady/ no extreme fluctuation, not too stressfull of a lifestyle given that the person knows what they are getting themselves into. now to counter that, heres an opposite spin: that same person decides not to goto school, and wants to become a real estate investor. due to the funds that would have gone for tuition he/she can now invest/buy in an apartment building. right off bat there is SO much more risk involved in this. for all we know, all the tenants leave b/c the area gets bad, the owner cant pay the taxes or pay the mortgage off, and the building gets repossessed. but say for instance that there is a demand for apartments in that area, the owner raises rent, renovates the building with that money, and is able to put that money into another purchase of a house..... the persons in the end has made some significant change $$ point being tho that in all walks of life, it should be common sense that people usually, i stress usually because there are always rare exceptions, are capable of making a better living because they are also in the risk of living poorly very fast, a lot is on the line. As the stock market saying goes, the more risk, the more gain, the more loss. How can one say that this wealth should be distibuted evenly, when the risk for acheiving this wealth is Never distributed evenly. I know im gonna get killed for this, but someone who has nothing, has nothing to lose, he/she can only gain something. On the flipside, one with a lot, has a lot to lose, but likewise is more able to make a lot. Sorry for the long post, and i hope it makes sense, its 4am here","capitalism-socialism","05:03 AM","government-debates","91"

Therefore, there isn't much risk in them squandering any amount of money on a bad deal. Conversely, if a poorer person works all the way through school to get a teaching job, they have a lot more at risk. If they fail as a teacher they have no other options- one degree, one career. If they get fired or laid off, they won't have been able to save much to fund them looking for another job.","capitalism-socialism","02:37 AM","government-debates","92"
