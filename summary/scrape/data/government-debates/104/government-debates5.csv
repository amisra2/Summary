Each religion has its own place to turn, but none of them should ever be able to turn to the Federal Government. The Constitution gives certain delegated powers to the Federal Government and handing money out for educational purposes is not one of them. Socialism is merely the stepping stone into Communism, and I don't want to see this nation start down that path. Maybe I live by the Constitution because it is ""the supreme Law of the Land."" The question is not why do I live by the Constitution, but why don't you? Until the Constitution is replaced it will govern this land, and I plan to live by it.","capitalism-socialism","11:09 AM","government-debates","62"

I too believe this country needs reform but you don't see me ignoring the Const. If you really feel strongly about your position, which I doubt not that you do, then I would suggest you write you Congressional representatives and express your concerns, other than that, and moving out of the country, I don't think you have too many other options. Further, what does the rejection of our Constitution have to do with not liking Capitialism?(And you still haven't responded to the first part of my last post.)","capitalism-socialism","07:17 PM","government-debates","68"

How could a socialistic country help the poor. History shows that Socialism creates poor. Welfare has been proven to make people reliant on the government. Government needs to spend more money. Higher taxes. Economy suffers and more people become poor. Capitalism has worked in the past. Look at England before Industrial Revolution lots of poor. After Industrial Revolution England rich less poor. Let's remember the important ecomonic principle Trade creates Weath. Aid creates taxes and more poor.","capitalism-socialism","09:59 AM","government-debates","69"

"03-22-2003","104",5,"None","None","None","lukecrouch","5356","I am a new reader of this forum, which I see has lots of activity. I was just wanting to add my own comments, and hopefully cause some people to think critically about some of the issues brought up...I had to put two posts for character limit. fallingupwards made a post: >why do i prefer socialism over capitalism? i would like to break it down into three sections: economic reasons, humanitarian reasons, and religious reasons. Given this opening, what follows then is not a summary of facts why socialism is superior to capitalism, but why one individual FEELS that it is better. >Economic reason: utility theory teaches us that it is more economically efficient if we divide the wealth more equally. one dollar is worth more to a poor person than it is to a rich person, correct? no one can deny that fact. one dollar is not worth as much to a rich person as it is to a poor person. therefore, if we distribute the wealth more equally, we will be using our resources MORE EFFICIENTLY by giving it to those who value them the most. I would like some more explanation of this. It sounds as if the reasoning for taking a dollar from a richer person, and giving it to a poorer person originates in the idea that a poorer person will utilize the dollar in a more productive fashion (more utility) than a richer person. The cases can be made on both sides here. One side would say that the rich person will spend the dollar on a cigar and burn it up while the poorer person will buy essentials. The other side says that the rich person will invest the dollar to produce and the poorer will buy booze. I would like to know how the mere act of re-distribution solidifies the former of the two scenarios as the result. The obvious conclusion is that the poorer must be in a position that essentials are not provided by their own income. If this is the case, our modern (not pure) system of capitalism temporarily provides, through public and private channels, for essentials, to people unable to obtain them on their own. The current system is set up to help people provide for themselves and eventually become a supplier of essentials for others and so on and so forth. This system is in place and practical today. In the socialist practice, which is historically different than the socialist theory, essentials are provided by re-distribution of wealth, which causes a decrease in over-all production - Soviet Union, North Korea, et all. The effects are that the poorer become equal with the rich, and productivity decreases, causing a stagnated growth in utility. So while everyone in a socialist system has the same utility, over time that utility is exponentially smaller than even the lowest levels of utility caused by the modified capitalist system. One way to look at it is...over time, socialistic systems increase productivity very slowly for all peoples equally. Capitalistic systems increase productivity at huge rates, first for those able to benefit the most (the wealthy) and then later for those who did not have sufficient investment in the system to benefit (the poor). Think of the cost of living in America. Essentials AND amenities have become cheap enough that the poor, while very far below the standards of the rich, or very far above the standard of the poor 75 years ago. Conversly, those 75 years were all it took for practical socialism to crumple and fall, destroying both rich and poor alike in the Soviet Union. >Humanitarian reason: socialism is clearly more moral than capitalism. have you ever heard of that saying: ""money is the root of all evil""? well, money is the foundation of capitalism. that should tell you a lot about capitalism. lets look at this logically: 1. money is the root of all evil 2. money is the foundation of capitalism 3. therefore, capitalism is evil another reason to dislike capitalism from a humanitarian standpoint is the fact that ONE PERCENT OF OUR NATION OWNS HALF OF THE TOTAL WEALTH. how is that moral? how is that ethical? i'm not saying that everyone should get paid the same amount. but the wealth needs to be distributed more equally. you should get paid according to how much work and effort you put into a job. in this case, teachers would make the same amount as most businessmen. also, PURE capitalists believe that the minimum wage should be abolished. this is very very very unethical and immoral. This assertion is as illogical as the notion that your statements are the ""facts"" the show socialism superior to capitalism. Although I do share the sentiment that it is very sad that 1% of the nation owns 50% of the wealth, and it is perhaps un-ethical, that does not mean that the fault lies in the wealthy. Too often arguments like this one, which is premised on an incorrect logical process, are used in a sort of class-warfare argument against capitalism. The wealth is there, wether it is in the hands of the wealthy or the poor. As previously noted, maximum utility is not a foregon result of redistribution of wealth. Because, thank God, all peoples have free will and choice to do with our posessions as we will. However, where class warfare loses its substance is in the underlying notion that the wealthy attempt to prevent the poor from progressing into the wealthy ""class"" on such false ""facts"" that the wealthy just don't want competition. It is true that devices like Monopolies benefit from being the ""King-of-the-Mountain,"" but these devices are regulated and not allowed in our, note again, MODERN, NON-PURE, PRACTICAL capitalistic system. There are still some missing regulations to prevent the wealthy from using their power to suppress the poor...an immoral and un-ethical action, yes. But the idea that merely because the wealthy are wealthy, the system is un-ethical is as baseless as the logical process you presented. The premise of your argument is that ""money is the root of all evil."" I think someone censored your Bible, because mine reads, in Timothy 6:10 ""For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows."" Note that the LOVE OF money is the root of all evil. The love of money is akin to the act of the wealthy hording money and preventing the poor from attaining it. This scripture tell us that this action is immoral, erring from the faith. This is true. So, regulations should be in place to stop the wealthy from preventing the poor to attain wealth, but that is not the same as regulations which re-distribute the wealth blatantly, which itself is an immoral act. Wether you take my money, or the government took my money to give to you, it was still stealing. I would rather give of my own accord to help my fellow man, because it is not only moral, but righteous.","capitalism-socialism","01:29 PM","government-debates","71"
"03-22-2003","104",5,"None","None","None","lukecrouch","5358",">Religious reason: being a Christian, religion is obviously very important to me and is reason enough to believe that one system is better than the other. this might not be the case for you guys (i dont know if you're a Christian or not). but nonetheless, it is very important to me. Jesus taught over and over again that the rich should share their wealth with the poor. he said this through parables and the beatitudes and many other instances. it is quite clear that Jesus had compassion on the poor. MOST (and notice i did not say all) rich people do not share a lot of their money with the poor, relative to how much they really make. therefore, since the rich are not giving to the poor as much as they should, we need government to redistribute the wealth for them. if the rich gave enough to the poor, then we wouldnt have this problem. but they dont. we need government. I am a Christian too. I very passionately support the idea of giving to the needy. Jesus Christ, our Saviour and our example which we should all strive to live like, was infallible, without sin, the Son of God. Our government, which has brutally construed the idea of seperation of Church and state, is in no way infallible, and is more sinful than any thousands of humans could ever be. The Bible teaches that we are to strive to be as Jesus was and is. In light of this, I think our (those of us striving for righteousness) responsibility should be left to us, and not passed on to the government. My case on this was solidifed when I saw the work of a publicly-funded artist(being supported by a government program for artists). All of his work was sacreligous and one item was a sculpture of Christ on the cross...upside down in a large vat of real urine. We DON'T need government. We need people to have compassion, reason and accounability. Your case that very few rich share their money with the poor is very valid, and I share it and condemn those that horde money and live lavishly while others struggle for necessities. However, I believe legislation should exist so that those that ARE charitable can have less taken from them by the government. This would be a better way to encourage those that are wealthy that giving is beneficial, rather than just encouraging the cycle that seems to be these peoples' minds. IE: I make a lot of money, government takes much more, so I need to make much more, government takes more etc. etc. I forget the scripture now, and cannot find it(if you can, please let me know) that reads: [paraphrasing] ""The task of the righteous man is to serve God and to give openly, the task of the un-righteous is to horde wealth to give it up to the righteous man."" I don't know about you, but I would rather exist in a system where the righteous are allowed to profit freely while still serving God and able (and hopefully willing) to give. In this regard, many, if not all, historical socialistic systems have been secularized, not allowing the notion of God on the premise that the being of God is impossible according to dialectic philosophy. So the government, historically corrupt, plays the role of God - determining what is righteous and what is true - according to the needs of society. Even the socialists recognize the idea that society needs God, but they attempt to play the role, rather than let individuals strive for the role and exemplify righteousness to each other. While I don't believe our system is infallible, I believe it is far superiour to socialism, by the arguments I have laid out. Please let me know your feelings on these issues.","capitalism-socialism","01:29 PM","government-debates","72"
