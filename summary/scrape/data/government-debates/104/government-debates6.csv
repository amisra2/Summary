"03-23-2003","104",6,"None","None","None","lukecrouch","5405","I would also like to address a common statistic used to demonstrate that capitalism only helps the richest. http://www.armory.com/~rstevew/WealthDist_TheNation.pdf The statistic I found was that in 1998, the richest 1% of the population owned 38.1% of the wealth. If someone else can post a more current statistic, please do so...it does not matter, as this statistic is irrelevant based on the observations below: The ""wealth"" of this study is explicitly stated to include ALL assets like houses, bank accounts, and (this one is very important) stock portfolios. A stock portfolio, remember, contains all market assets like mutual funds, index funds, and stocks of individual companies. Now, Let's take a hypothetical example of a billionare like Warren Buffet...whose ""wealth"" fluctuates with the market, but is stated to be near 30 billion. (A nice note about this guy: His ""value investing"" style mirrors his lifestyle and overall philosophy on life: he doesn't live in a huge house, he doesn't collect cars, and he doesn't take a limousine to work. In fact, ""The Oracle of Omaha"" lives in the same house he once bought for $31,500. Wish he could teach the Hollywood elitist liberals a thing or two.) A man like Warren Buffet is worth 30 billion, but remember that this worth is houses (apparently 31,500), bank accounts, and stock portfolio. Let's say the house value is essentially nothing. So his 30 billion is split between bank accounts and stock assets, maybe 50/50. (Although I doubt a man with the investment genius like Buffet has anything less than 80% in stocks). 50% of 30 billion is 15 billion. In stocks. Stocks like Coca Cola, American Express, and Gilette. Last year, Coca Cola spent $7 billion dollars in expenses. Do you know where that $7 billion goes? Into the pockets of employees, to small business that sell them bottling equipment, and to their various franchises and subsidiaries. Gilette spent $7.2 billion. And American Express spent $21 billion in the same way. As an owner of stock in these companies, Buffet owns percentages of the company. A man like Buffet can own a powerful 5-10% even. So, if Buffet is forced to give a percentage of his wealth away, that means he has to liquidate some of it, sell stock. He looks and sees that his Coca Cola stock is the least impressive, so he sells his 5% of it to pay for the ""tax""/""robbery"". 5% of $7 billion = $350 million. I hope you're going to explain to those employees and suppliers of Coca Cola why it is your taking $350 million away from them. If this money were put to welfare, you are essentially laying off employees and taking away business from other suppliers (who may, in turn, have to lay off employees), to give money to the un-employed, of which you have now created more. So now welfare is again inadequate and the cycle has to continue, until everyone is dependent on the government welfare checks, all of which are inadequate. But if you follow the fundamental capitalistic idea of ""You make what you earn for yourself"" everyone has their own power to raise or lower their income at their choosing. Some may have to work harder at it than others...but such is life. And even if it might hurt some peoples' feelings, it is the best thing to do.","capitalism-socialism","12:38 PM","government-debates","77"

This time with an interesting statistic similar to the ""wealth"" statistic, only this one is a bit more meaningful. Total income tax share (percentage) by highest wage-earners: Year: Total........Top 1%...Top 5%...Top 10%..Top 25%..Top 50% 1986: 100.00......25.75......42.57......54.69......76.02 ......93.54 1987: 100.00......24.81......43.26......55.61......76.92 ......93.93 1988: 100.00......27.58......45.62......57.28......77.84 ......94.28 1989: 100.00......25.24......43.94......55.78......77.22 ......94.17 1990: 100.00......25.13......43.64......55.36......77.02 ......94.19 1991: 100.00......24.82......43.38......55.82......77.29 ......94.52 1992: 100.00......27.54......45.88......58.01......78.48 ......94.94 1993: 100.00......29.01......47.36......59.24......79.27 ......95.19 1994: 100.00......28.86......47.52......59.45......79.55 ......95.23 1995: 100.00......30.26......48.91......60.75......80.36 ......95.39 1996: 100.00......32.31......50.97......62.51......81.32 ......95.68 1997: 100.00......33.17......51.87......63.20......81.67 ......95.72 1998: 100.00......34.75......53.84......65.04......82.69 ......95.79 1999: 100.00......36.18......55.45......66.45......83.54 ......96.00 2000: 100.00......37.42......56.47......67.33......84.01 ......96.09 As you can see, this shows that the top 1% of wage-earners pay 37.42% of taxes paid in this country. Taking that number to just the top 5% accounts for more than half of all income taxes paid. Keep in mind, this statistic differs from the 1% wealthiest because these are income tax numbers. So this top 5% is not necessarily the top 5% wealthiest people, but rather the top 5% of income earners. That's the working class...not the wealthy living off of their fully purchased assets. So, in the current tax system in America, you are punished for WORKING more, not necessarily for HAVING more. Starting to understand why we're called the lazy land of excess?","capitalism-socialism","10:01 AM","government-debates","80"

What is the GDP/citizen? China? $838/person. N. Korea? $900/person. Admittedly that is not ALL due to socialism, but a large part of it. In addition, explain to me the mistakes that were made during the communist revolutions in the countries like Soviet Union and China. More importantly explain to me (and write a book) the remedies to these problems? This is the main problem with many socialists. It's easy to support an idea that hasn't come to fruition. The blank page will never answer back to you. It also takes a very large amount of arrogance to assume that YOU understand Marxist socialism better than, say, the founders of the Soviet Union. Most socialists read the manifesto once, read a bunch of Hegel and conclude that they've got it all figured out. The good news for us capitalists is that we don't need to study socialism in depth to refute it. Because very intelligent people in other countries have already done so and brought about the death of socialism on their own - because even all these scholars put together couldn't create a viable working model of it. Socialism is nice on paper, but in the real world, it has no merit.","capitalism-socialism","11:36 AM","government-debates","84"

Now why would you ever have the motivation to become more than an average worker, a janitor, cashier, whatever, rather than a doctor, or a scientist. A doctor or a scientist takes years of study, dedication and hard work, anyone can be a cashier. So if a cashier makes the same as a teacher, or a doctor, or a scientist, why take the hard route? Human nature is what human nature is, and while I would like to believe that the majority of people are good, many who would be quite happy to suck of the system and do their meager amount of work and live as well as any other person. In socialism there is no motivation to succeed. There is no drive to better oneself because no matter what you do to improve your standing, you never improve your surroundings, lifestyle, or anything else. In a capitalist society the drive to succeed is everywhere. You want a better car? Get that raise by working harder and you can have it. Get that degree, work at the university you can have it. You want a house in the country so you can give your kid a pony that you always wished you could have, put that overtime in, keep your nose to the grindstone, show your boss what an asset you are and you can have it. You have an idea? Get a patent, start your own company and generations of your lineage can live quite nicely for the work you've put in. Why should the guy sitting on the porch doing nothing profit from your work when he's done nothing to better himself or add his knowledge to society? Capitalism forces people to excel. In such a society such as the US has is it any wonder why even the poor here live better than many rich in other countries?","capitalism-socialism","12:58 AM","government-debates","90"
