"01-31-2003","104",1,"None","None","None","American","393","I ran some numbers and here is what I came up with.... If you had 1 billion dollars, and you spent $1,000 an hour. It would take you more than 114 years to spend the billion. Obviously we don't need a ton of money to survive, but I think that if someone has the discipline to work hard enough and save that much money they should be able keep it. It goes with the verse ""In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread."" Notice that it does not say ""In the sweat of thy face shalt Joey eat bread."" Here is where the principle of work for your own food starts, in Gen. 3:19, from the mouth of God Himself.","capitalism-socialism","12:24 PM","government-debates","2"

"01-31-2003","104",1,"None","None","None","fallingupwards","479","thanks calli for giving me a whole five hours to reply before you say i'm too scared to debate. i dont sit at my computer all day. ok guys, i posted this in another forum in the past so if you've read this before, i apologize. but i think that it is so true and i want to hear your comments on it: i took economics last semester and learned about something called utility theory. the greater a person's income, the smaller is the marginal benefit of a dollar. the millionth dollar spent by a rich person brings a smaller marginal benefit to that person than the marginal benefit of the thousandth dollar spent by a poorer person. so by transferring a dollar from the millionaire to the poorer person, more is gained than is lost and the two people added together are better off. american, i really respect you as a debater because you really know what you are talking about. you are very knowledgable about the subjects we discuss and make valid points. even though we disagree on a lot of stuff, i really respect you. calli, you seriously have no idea what you are talking about. like ever. nobody can ever have an intelligent debate with you. i'm sorry, but thats how it is.","capitalism-socialism","10:22 PM","government-debates","5"
"02-03-2003","104",1,"None","None","None","American","813","Falling~ The respect between us is mutual, and I believe derived from our disagreements, of which we have found another. Some may indeed be gained by the transfer of a dollar from a rich to a poor person, that I do not contend. It is the means by which that dollar is trransferred that I question. Let me put it like this: About three years ago I started my own business. I went completely broke in order to get myself started, and now I am making a decent income. Why should the government be able force me to give you some of my money in order to cover your hospitial bill?","capitalism-socialism","11:40 PM","government-debates","7"
"02-04-2003","104",1,"None","None","None","Broker","839","Exactly! The government wasn't there for you, but they want more of your money to pay for other people's problems.","capitalism-socialism","07:53 AM","government-debates","8"
"02-04-2003","104",1,"None","None","None","dsadevil","903","Does society have an obligation to help the wellbeing of its own members, or is it every man for themselves? I would hold that as we are a ""society"" we have to be concerned with the social part of it, and work to help everyone, rather than select, even talented, individuals or packs.","capitalism-socialism","05:52 PM","government-debates","9"
"02-04-2003","104",1,"None","None","None","American","907","Dsa, I concur in part, but would say that it is not the job of the government to force us to ""work to help everyone."" If you were to have emergency surgery and couldn't pay the bill all you would have to do is ask me to help and I would. That is how the society takes care of itself, not through welfare and medicare. Besides I believe that more of the dollar's value would be lost in the transfer from Joe XXXX to government to Billy Boy, than if Joe XXXX gave the money directly to Billy Boy. Would you not agree?","capitalism-socialism","06:33 PM","government-debates","10"
"02-04-2003","104",1,"None","None","None","dsadevil","908","Sure, but unfortunantly too few joe blows are willing to give up money for the amount of billy boys there are, and its impossible to match up the willing joe blows with needy billy boys on a large scale, and often the joe blows who can afford to give (assuming they are willing) are not in contact with the billy boys who need the gift. If people, as a whole, were as altruistic and kind as you purport, government would be unnecessary, and we'd naturally become rather utopian in a pseudo communist sort of way. But we aren't that kind, thus the need for government mandate.","capitalism-socialism","07:25 PM","government-debates","11"
"02-04-2003","104",1,"None","None","None","Broker","944","Forcing us to pay for other mistakes just gives me another reason not do to it. It's not your money, it's our money, and you aren't going to spend it well, you'll pay some guys at the SEC more than the president when they're only agenda at their first meeting was to set their salaries. If I have some money I want to go to a good cause, the first place I'd put it would not be our government. All our government combined wastes about 10- 20 billion on social security, medicare, and welfare fraud alone. These super compassionates run the welfare system and won't cut anyone's welfare...California one of the biggest waste states...","capitalism-socialism","10:41 PM","government-debates","12"

""its not your money, its OUR money"" our money our money our money. you probably have a shrine in your house where you worship your money. not all of us are like you broker. some of us believe in sharing our wealth with the less fortunate.","capitalism-socialism","10:58 PM","government-debates","13"

Concentratlion camps? Oh what the h*ll, there won't be very many people like Broker after 50 years of socialism, just shoot them and burry them in a secret ditch. No one will miss them. Falling is that your vision of social justice?","capitalism-socialism","11:08 PM","government-debates","14"
"02-04-2003","104",1,"None","None","None","Broker","954","It is our money. It is not the government's money. They waste enough and I don't want to give them more. They don't scare how they spend it, so I don't want to give it. If I have wealth I will share it. Gates, Morgan, Rockefeller, Carnegie, etc, etc, etc, etc. The government isn't taking 85% of my income to waste it. It can take some, but no more than half. Would you give money to the government or the Red Cross? I don't know many people who are OK with unchecked government spending, but you just got in. You wouldn't mind if our taxes were raised to 99%...","capitalism-socialism","11:09 PM","government-debates","15"
