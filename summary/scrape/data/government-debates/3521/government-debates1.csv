The ""conservatism"" that republicans follow is a mix of liberalism and reagnomics, and is pretty barren of the classical american conservative platform. Why should conservatives vote for liberterians? 1) Small government 2) Fiscial responsibility 3) Getting government out of your lives 4) Using the military to protect America Check out their site emclean: I'm extremely tempted to vote for Badranik.","why-dont-conservatives-vote-liberterian","08:34 PM","government-debates","4"

I am going through public schools and major change is needed. We aren't learning anymore, we're trying to pass tests. The point of school has become to pass tests and not actually learn. People memorize stuff, take the test, then in the next month forget it. We need to focus more on learning. We also should have a more flexible plan. Not everyone learns at the same rate. We need to make it so people have a love of learning and so that people can explore different topics. Everyone should learn the basics but then the teacher could help small groups who didn't understand something or they could help the students who understood it advance to the next level and encourage them to explore things they're interested in. Some things I disagree with him on, but out of him Kerry and Bush, I would vote him if I could vote (I can in 4 more years)","why-dont-conservatives-vote-liberterian","05:07 PM","government-debates","8"
"10-30-2004","3521",1,"Dzeron","None","Because conservatism and libertarianism are almost opposites. Both conservatives and libertarians favor capitalism, but conservatives support non-economic tyranny like seatbelt laws, drinking ages, drug prohibition, and marriage laws. Libertarians oppose these. Libertarians are actually closer to liberals in my opinion.","Duo_Maxwell","74383","That's not necessarily true. You're mixing Republicanism, which is a far cry from Conservatism with conservativism.","why-dont-conservatives-vote-liberterian","05:00 PM","government-debates","12"

Republicanism: belief that republics are the best form of government. Conservatism: belief that the government should tyrannize people in personal, rather than economic, affairs.","why-dont-conservatives-vote-liberterian","05:39 PM","government-debates","13"
