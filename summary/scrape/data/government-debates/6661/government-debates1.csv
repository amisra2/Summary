Soviet russia was so far removed from the communist ideals of equality as contemporary Russia. Power, wealth and influence was concentrated in a precious elite... In fact, it`s probably the same elite that rules Russia today. I can`t think of any Soviet benefits over US-style democracy, apart from the societ educational system (but that`s not even entirely a political issue).","communism-v-democratic-republic","06:37 PM","government-debates","4"
"10-19-2005","6661",1,"None","None","None","plato","172321","One more thing I'll post is thje rudimetary concept of communism: Everyone is equal. A farmer makes $40 a month than a doctor makes $20 a month. No one in a communist government owns land, so there are no rights, except for the members of the the communist party, they own land. Finally, there isn't an equalized system of healthcare, one person can afford healthcare, one cannot.","communism-v-democratic-republic","06:40 PM","government-debates","5"

I don`t think this has anything to do with the concept of communism. Not even with the concept of communism in Soviet-russia.","communism-v-democratic-republic","06:49 PM","government-debates","6"

The soviet unon was not a communist state by even the loosest definition. It was a totalitarian socialist state. Communisim is a purely theoretical concept. It has never been tried. Under cummunism, everybody just kind of does the job they like and gets whatever they need to get by. In theory, very appealing. Every time it has been tried, it has resulted in a bunch of poor people, a bloodbath, and a ton of corrution. Since communism is pretty much a failed system of ideals, I owudl go with a democratic republic, but NOT like we have in the US. What we have int he us is a severely flawed system that needs some correction.","communism-v-democratic-republic","06:56 PM","government-debates","7"

We in America should keepthis in mind as we watch our 2 parties comingle to the point that they become indistinguishable.","communism-v-democratic-republic","09:35 PM","government-debates","9"
