Referred to states? I stand by my promise that should it be vetoed I will change my avatar to most likely something baseball related. VoR just showed the site that said the house voted on it and the Senate had a chance, but I haven't heard anything since then, and that was a while ago.","flag-burning-amendment","01:05 AM","government-debates","1"

"09-18-2005","6432",1,"None","None","None","daewoo","163411","Duke Cunningham, who spearheaded the amendment int eh HOR is being charged with accepting a bribe from a pentagon contractor, the senate has not voted on it, nor are they actually expected to, and they have not yet found a state that is expected to pass the new drivel should it get through congress (though for a while it looked like oklahoma was willing). As with all the toher times it has made it through the house, it is essentially dead in the senate, and the states, who seem to supprot such a thing in the beginning, have backed off their support. VOR was an idiot.","flag-burning-amendment","11:08 AM","government-debates","4"

The orignal makers of the flag, and the leaders at the time, they themselves didn't even care about the flag. To them the flag represented our country. The flag itself was only a material object to them, like a blanket or piece of cloth. What was important was the country it stood for. If you obliterate every one of our flags out country will still be here. If the people who made our country didn't care about the flag why should we?","flag-burning-amendment","01:21 AM","government-debates","5"

As long as the conservates are in power and wrap themselves in the flag, while bashing gays and lesbians, the great flag will become a symbol of hate. To the republicans and conservates the flag has become a God so in their minds burning and desacrating the flag is heresy.","flag-burning-amendment","07:55 AM","government-debates","6"

After all, it is just a material object that represents the country, and our country will still be here if it is destroyed. Would that also have made it right to destroy the World Trade Center, if there had been no one killed in the process?","flag-burning-amendment","12:06 PM","government-debates","8"
