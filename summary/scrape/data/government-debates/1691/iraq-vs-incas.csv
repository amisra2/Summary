Well i've done just that with the War in Iraq. If u study the war with Iraq and the Inca conquest u will find there are many similiarities. Pizzaro went into the Inca empire and warped there internal government from despotism to monarchy and used puppets from the high ranking officials in the Inca civilization. Spain gained a lot of resources while Inca civilians are killed everyday in the streets Today Bush goes into Iraq and warp their internal government by changing it to democracy and we already have some ""Americanize"" Muslims ready to take the title president of Iraq. You might as well call him a puppet because the US will be getting dibs on all the oil Iraq contains. Spain used the idea of spreading Christianity today were using the idea of spreading Democracy. The Inca war strenghtened the Spaniards just like this Iraq war strenghtens the US. My point is many historians look back at the Inca conquest and denounce it as a act of greed and intimidation. The same thing will happen in this war in the long run. Many today already see it as an act of greed and an act of bullying in the Middle East.","iraq-vs-incas","02:04 AM","government-debates","1"

When you've succeeded in pacifying another nation it opens up the door for new opportunities. Establishments and corporations can move into the newfound territory and make lucrative gains. It's been all over the news. Everyone knows we're setting up commercialism there and inviting and offering our coalition partners, and even some non-participants, a piece of the pie. This war was nothing more than a geopolitical move. Anyone with half a braincell could calculate the outcome of this war.","iraq-vs-incas","04:43 PM","government-debates","4"
"02-02-2004","1691",1,"None","None","None","plotter","33546","Interesting point. When the american walked into baghdad, and saw there was no such thing as iraqi army, what did they do? While iraqis were looting everything they could lay there hands on, hospital equipment, carpets, chairs, university, archeological treasures. What did the ""liberating"" american troops do? They guarded the offices of the oil ministry. Just as pizaro went for the yellow gold, bush goes for black gold.","iraq-vs-incas","05:06 PM","government-debates","5"

We like it here comparing the U.S. going into Iraq with Spaniards going into the America's. Besides every analogy will fail if you break it down enough LOL We were simply making the point that the U.S. is going into iraq for the same reasons the spaniards went into the america's. We are not saying america is similiar in treatment to the local popluation to the spaniards, only that their motives were the same.","iraq-vs-incas","05:28 PM","government-debates","8"

Oil accounts for 98% of Iraq's GDP. You would let them take the oil ministry and destroy the only source of money that could help rebuild the country?","iraq-vs-incas","05:39 PM","government-debates","9"
