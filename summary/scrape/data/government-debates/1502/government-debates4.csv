"01-10-2004","1502",4,"treat2","None","Plotter, I am always well into the left-wing on almost every subject, except certain previsionsin of the Patriot Act. I recognize the need for domestic spying and survailence, at the present time. Acording to the FBI, they have wiped out 2/3rds of Al-Qaeda. That is a VERY impressive estimate. And I recognize it could be a completely wrong estimate, and recognize that Al-Qaeda is but 1 of a number of world wide terrorist organizations. During the 1960's and 70's there were a number of student organizations, and radical groups that we're anti-war, and were reacting to racism. The vast majority of the survailence done by the FBI/CIA was totally unjustified, and a stupid. And being anti-War myself, I didn't like the widespread domestic spying going on. After the War in the later 70's, 80's and 90's, there was no domestic terrorism, except the usual few nuts going around bombing Black Churches in the South, Shooting Abortion Doctors, and that kind of stuff. (Not nearly enough to justify any huge program of Domestic Spying..) Things are different today. We do have very porous borders. And a great many ways and methods to communicate messages, just as we are doing now. We also do have a problem with foreign and domestic terrorism. I recognize that. I worked in the WTC for 5 years and was greatly effected by 9/11. I recognize the need for a lot more monitoring that is going on now. It does NOT change the subject matter, nor the language I use in my communications, and it really doesn't bother me terribly, because I know that the FBI is concerned with people that are not going to write sh*t that bores them to tears. So, if the wanna listen to a boring phone call, or read my Bush-Bashing posts, they are entirely welcome to do so, and I feel in no way prevented fromdoing anything I always did. Naturally, at some point things will queit down for a very long time, and if it does, and there is no great benefit to the FBI having broad survailence powers, I would CERTAINLY not be in favor of those provisions of the Patriot Act, however, the prospect of that happening or not happening din no way changes my mind about the need for survailence today. Other aspects of the Patriot Act need refinement, as there have been too many reports of innocent people being kept incommunicado for long periods of time.","plotter","30765","What are you exactly trying to say?

You may not care who spies on you, but there are many people that do, monitering people in the name of security is nonsense, you cannot find such an enemy, there are many sympethisers too, they help any potential terrorist, how would you find them, you cant read peoples minds, not as far as i know, although any government that can is definately a big brother.

"01-19-2004","1502",4,"None","None","None","daewoo","31943","This is an interesting parallel to draw. I don't know if I would agree that it is a valid comparison or not. Of course, by the time you know for sure, it would most likely be too late to do anything about it. Something I do find a little distressing is an AP wire story that was run in a local paper about a guy who had been arrested for something or other. An FBI agent was quoted as saying ""....we originally became suspicious of him because of certain credit card purchases he had made, so we initiated an investigation"". My question is, if they were not already suspicous of the guy, and were not already investigating him, how the h&ll did they know what he had been purchasing with his credit cards? I wish the story had given more details, but it was only about a three-incher and I was unable to find further reference. The question of security vs. liberty is an old and multi-faceted one. Personally, I come down on the side of liberty. There are prices for liberty, ond one of them is the possibilty of people misusing that liberty. It has been proven that through the elimination of liberty you can ensure security (USSR). I, for one, am not willing to make that trade. As for the press issues that were presented here, I have to say that my personal opinion when it comes to the American press is that they do tend to follow the lead of government. I also do not think they are any better when it comes to reporting accuratly than most of the international press agencies. An example I would put forth is the way they handled the lead up to the war in Iraq. Dissenters were branded as ""unpatriotic"". The French and Germans were treated as traitors to America (remember ""freedom fries""). Now, completely laying aside whether the war was justified or not, It was a violation of international law. You are not allowed to run around invading other countries on the basis of percieved security risks, real or imagined. The issue of international law was a valid one, and deserved consideration. Those who brought up this issue did not deserve to be branded as ""unamerican"". As a policy, I do not generally put much faith in the ramblings of any press agency unless I am able to independantly confirm the facts laid forth in their reports. From the research I have done, the most accurate media agency DURING the war, was Al-Jazeera. Not all of their articles were very flattering to America. They did, however, cite sources far more often than the US agencies, and their sources ALWAYS panned out. Many people take great exception to this, and claim that Al-Jazeera is fervently anti-american. I would ask you to think back to the war in Afghanistan. George Bush PERSONALLY commended Al-Jazeera for their impartial reporting. Think about the coverage of the war you saw on US tv. They spent half the time slamming al-jazeera, but half the live shots you saw had the al-jazeera logo in the corner. Regardless of what you saw on MSNBC, FOX, or CNN, an illegal invasion of a sovergn state by an agressor, is not going to be all sunshine and roses for either side. What I found particulalrly offensive was the reports from US servicemen that they were ordered to stage events for the cameras. The response from the military commanders? Propoganda is a weapon like any other, we would be fools not to use it. Staging events for the camera is not ""news"". If I want to se events staged for the camera, I will go see a movie. I think it is reprehensible that any US news organization, or their reporters, would film things that they knew were fictional (some of the soldiers claimed that they were required to do several ""takes"" until it came out just right) and present them to the American public as ""news"". The fact that the 3 biggest news outlts all took part in this guves me cause to seriously question whether or not ANY of them have any integrity as a news organization at all. I am not saying ""just get your news from Al-Jazeera"". I am saying that people need to question everything they see or hear. Do your own research. The internet is a powerful tool. It can be used to spread disinformation. It is equally valuable as a research tool. You have access to an incredible amount of information. It is right there at your fingertips, all you have to do is find your way to a good search engine and spend a little time looking around. This brings us to the second cost of liberty.......vigilance. Complacency and apathy are the favorite tools of the tyrant. Knowledge is the only defense.","2003-compared-1984-a","09:31 PM","government-debates","50"

"01-31-2004","1502",4,"None","None","None","daewoo","33233","This last week we did a system wide upgrade, including my home system, so I had some down time, part oif which I used to re-read 1984, Brave new world (Huxley) and Jack Londons The Iron Heel. I think that all these books more or less go together, and the prompting to review one led to the review of the others. After review, I think that, in parralel to todays world, the far more dangerous phenomenon that I believe we see quite a bit of today is the ""doublethink"", the ability to simultaneously accept two totally opposing viewpoints as fact. I also think that revisionist history (also an element of doublethink) applies to the state of current events. An example of revisionist history presents itself right now. It is 5:30 AM in kansas, and I have Fox news on in the background. They are discussing the faulty intelligence that led the US to believe that there were massive stockpiles of WMD's in Iraq. They are discussing the ""failure"" in the intelligence community to have current information. I have heard similar stories on Msnbc and CNN. Surely I am not the only person in America who rememebrs shortly after the invasions, when no WMD's were found, the literally dozens of analysts who came forward and claimed that they were told to doctor the intel? Surely there is somebody else out there who remembers that? Certain aspects of the gun control argument are pretty good examples of doublethink. Specifically: ""By making guns illegal, criminals would not have them"". Now, we all know logically that criminals by definition are lawbreakers. Therefore, if guns were illegal, and somebody did not own them beacuse they are illegal, they would not be a criminal. If Guns are illegal, and criminals still have them, then they are still criminals. Either way, making guns illegal cannot have any possible effect on whether or not a criminal posesses a gun, since criminals, by definition, are lawbreakers. There is actually a large portion of our population that do not see the opposing logic in that statement. Another interesting parralel I found in my recent review, which is also related to revisionist history is the way they switch gears between Eurasia is the enemy"" and ""Eastasia is the enemy"". Again, I will use the recent war in Iraq as an example. All we heard before going in was WMD's, hundreds of tons of them, scourge of the earth...WMD's.....After we were inside Iraq, and it had become obvious to anybody but a complete fool that the pre-war arguments for hundreds of tons of WMD's was a complete fallacy, all we heard was ""freedom for the Iraqi people"" we went, literally overnight, from deposing a warmongering, WMD producing imminent threat to america, to liberating the poor iraqis from a cruel, mean person. This is a MAJOR difference. In one case, we are pre-emptively striking at a real and present danger to our personal security. In the other case, we are invading a sovergn nation in order to change theri internal politics. People switched gears on that one with no problem at all. On person I regularly debate with litereally did it overnight. One day, she was arguing the WMD case with a vengance. In response to queries regarding civilian casualties, she literally said ""screw the civilians, it is us or them"". Literally the next day, we were ""Liberating the Iraqi people"". In her mind, this had been the point of the war from the start. All of a sudden, it didn't really matter if we found WMD's or not, it was all about liberation. Opinion polls by the maor news services seemed to show that the majority of the population made this shift with no trouble at all.","2003-compared-1984-a","06:54 AM","government-debates","54"

Unfortunately they just focused on the dark side, if you will. They made good points though. Now. for that summary of Language Police. I obviously can't say it like she did, (that's why I'm not an author) but I'll 'do my darndest'. As far as I know, the problem that was stated in the book has been corrected... at least they say that. Back a while ago, starting in the 70's, people began forming boards to censor textbooks, and other liturature. And they were doing this without letting the readers know, like they're supposed to. They changes words, omitted lines and even paragraphs, so the literature would say what the board wanted it to say. Anywho. They began taking information out of school textbooks, simply because it might be offensive to someone, ANYONE. They started attacking things like Twain's accents, because they were racial. They glossed over the fact that he was writing it as it existed. They attacked writing of poverty, because some living in poverty would be offended. Oh,yeah. It DID/DOES exist though... They attacked stuff like that. (I can't give all examples; I read that book a few months ago, and returned it to the librarly already) They started taking information on people out of textbooks, and replacing that information with biographies of other people, who, by all means, didn't make as much of an impact, but they included them simply because the publishers had to meet standards like the following: They had to include all races proportionally. They had to include both genders. For every male hero mentioned, there must be a female. They couldn't use words like 'blind' because some might be offended. Instead they had to say that he couldn't see with his eyes, or something like that. Now, the male/female ratio wouldn't be that bad today. But when it comes to history, it simply isn't true, because quite simply, females were limited. They didn't make all the major ruling choices and whatnot. So basically texbook authors went about rewriting history. It's gotten better, but had those procedures gone on unchecked, our highschool graduates today probably wouldn't know the name George Washington.","2003-compared-1984-a","02:25 PM","government-debates","55"

The Federal Document Clearing House (FDCH), which provides transcripts of congressional hearings to news organizations and other subscribers, agreed to delete the testimony, in which a government contractor described security problems at the Rochester, N.Y., airport, at the request of the TSA general counsel. ""Somebody called and told us to take it down and we did it,"" said FDCH president Tony O'Brien. FDCH then passed along TSA's request to its media and other customers, including Congressional Quarterly, asking them to delete the prepared statement by the contractor, James McNeil, chief executive officer of Virginia-based McNeil Technologies. CQ declined to remove the testimony from its Web site, which makes thousands of documents, including congressional testimony, available to its subscribers. ""Our position is that any government statement voluntarily made public can't be classified retroactively at a later date,"" CQ President Robert Merry said. ""If Homeland Security wants to explain to us why maintaining this information on our Website could harm national security, we will consider a request to remove it. Absent that, we won't respond. ""I might note also that once such a document has been on a Website such as ours for any length of time,"" Merry added, ""it's already widely disseminated through downloading, and so what we do with it actually is of little consequence."" Discovered in December Bing Yee, an attorney in TSA's general counsel's office, said McNeil's November testimony on Rochester airport security lapses ""includes sensitive security information. ""We discovered this in late December but waited to get the transcript until last week,"" Yee said by telephone. ""We've asked everyone to erase it,"" he said, and replace it with a redacted version. The House Government Reform Committee did exactly that, posting a redacted version that excised McNeil's description of how TSA undercover security agents easily smuggled small handguns past Rochester airport screeners by taping them to their thighs with Ace bandages and claiming they had just had surgery. ""The screener assumed the agent was being truthful and would not have thought of asking her to remove a surgical bandage,"" McNeil testified. ""Moreover, the screener pointed out that she had never seen, or been trained to detect a small semi-automatic handgun by feeling it through layers of a bandage. ""The agent told us afterward that part of the reason this particular test was done was to show training weaknesses. We would welcome some guidance and training in this particular area,"" McNeil added. ""After the hearing,"" recalled committee spokesman David Marin, ""TSA came to us and said there were portions of testimony from a TSA contractor that TSA believed was sensitive and jeopardized national security. They asked us to redact those portions of the testimony from the official record of the hearing and from our website."" Marin did not have any information about when the committee was approached, other than that it was longer ago than in the past few days. ""They are the security people. They're the ones who gauge the risk. We're not going to second-guess their call on that,"" Marin said. Other Customers Another FDCH customer, Bloomberg News Service, said it was not asked to remove the document, which in any case it could not find in its archives. ""If they did carry it then it moved over our system"" to subscribers, said Bill Schmick, Bloomberg's defense and Congress editor. A spokeswoman for the data company LexisNexis said she could find no mention of the hearing beyond a listing in its daybook. A producer for The Washington Post's Web site said the hearing transcript was never posted there. TSA's Yee said McNeil had violated federal regulations on the handling of sensitive information by revealing the Rochester screener problems in his testimony. ""You're not supposed to talk about issues that might disclose weaknesses in the system,"" he said. ""I'm sure he knows we're upset with him,"" he added later. McNeil disputed that in a prepared statement Wednesday. ""We are not aware of any concerns that TSA might have. If there are concerns, we will deal with them when they are brought to our attention. As always, we are eager to work with TSA in helping to keep our nation's skies and passengers safe. That is and has always been our primary goal,"" McNeil said. ""Safety and security."" He added, ""We take our duty of keeping Greater Rochester International Airport safe and secure very seriously."" Yee said the agency was alerted to McNeil's testimony by ""the program manager handling private screeners at airports."" Sensitive but Not Classified Steven Aftergood, editor of Secrecy News, which follows classification issues for the Federation of American Scientists, called the government's effort to expunge unclassified testimony ""pernicious."" ""If there is an immediate threat to security, you deal with the threat,"" Aftergood said. ""You don't rewrite the public record."" FDCH's O'Brien said he ""might"" reconsider the decision to expunge the testimony, but added, ""Our bias is to cooperate with the government.""
