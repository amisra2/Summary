Only about 25% said the US shouldn't have. 60%+ think the US should remain in the country at least another year.","montalban","29776","Is the poll one conducted in Baghdad University? (ie. towards students). What are the demographics of those surveyed? How many were surveyed? What was the question put forward to them? Did the same Iraqiis express an unwillingess for American intervention before the war?","2003-compared-1984-a","09:05 PM","government-debates","16"

The Gallup organization has them available as does the coalition provisional authority. I get there by going thru the centcom webpages.","2003-compared-1984-a","09:08 AM","government-debates","17"
"01-05-2004","1502",2,"None","None","None","plotter","30125","America has set a dangerous precedent by invading iraq. They called it regime change, fine, they can call it what they like, the real reason is more likely to do with oil and control of the middle east, iran and syria are now very quiet. Now any state that has sufficient military power can use the expression ""regime change"" in its ambitions. And i suspect the bush government will use it again, whenever and wherever it feels it can gain a political advantage. This bush government is easily playing on peoples fears of another terrorist attack to implement a big brother monitering system so it can control its own people, the current american concept is, ""the american way is the only way"" and anybody that questions that, whether american or not, is simply ridiculed as an appeaser or a left wing liberal nut. Now that the bush government has managed to get control of the media using the fear of terrorism as a means of censoring the free press, in other words there telling the american people what they think they would like to hear, not the real truth. i think america is now slowly becoming a paranoid fearfull, xenophobic place, and i think calling it the best place to live is just another big brother brainwashing attempt to control the not so free american people. The sooner bush goes and press freedom is re-establish the better it will be for not only the american people but for the world too.","2003-compared-1984-a","11:14 AM","government-debates","18"

Such as declaring the opening moments of the war a failure just when it gets going only to have their own correspondents dispel that myth rapidly and have the opening stages of the war declared an unprecedented victory. Please provide some evidence for your outlandish claims. Opinion is not evidence just opinion. Also please provide a comparison to other times as this thread is essentially a then and now comparison.","2003-compared-1984-a","01:06 PM","government-debates","19"

Now that the saddam regime is practically gone, why are american troops still in Iraq in such great numbers? Why doesnt america change its unethical foreign policy, especially regarding the middle east, and adopt a more fair foreign policy. That alone will probably end 95% of any terrorist threat to america alone. And when does the free press ask any real questions to politicians? Theres a few questions i would like to ask bush and company, the problem is they wouldnt let me in any press conference. Why isnt the free press allowed to go to certain press conferences, only by invite. Why is the press on a number of occasions, censored and not allowed to publish certain news? All in the name of security, so we are told.","2003-compared-1984-a","05:54 PM","government-debates","20"

Normal people don't have to report to be fingerprinted. :-\ The US Visit Program already has been shown to work--21 people in test areas were denied access to the country for good reason. had such a program been in place before 9/11 several hijackers would have been stopped at their access points. What citizens have been in prison for years with no trial?","2003-compared-1984-a","08:47 PM","government-debates","23"

Guantanomo bay, remember them. Granted they are suspected of terrorism and they should get what they deserve, but still holding them for so long without a trial is wrong and immoral. saddam held all types of prisonors for years without trial, both poilitical and pows from iran and even kurds. Give them their trials, and hand out there sentences. If i remember rightly those terrorists of 9/11 were allowed in on visas, right? So how would fingerprinting them on entry would have prevented them doing what they did, they didnt have terrorist tatood on there foreheads did they? And what happens to all that information gained? is it kept on a data base? good way of gathering info on people, isnt that big brother? And what would stop a determined terrorist going to say mexico and sneaking over the border to the U.S? I mean these people are suicidal.","2003-compared-1984-a","07:53 AM","government-debates","24"

The entire US should just do what you want. Real evidence not just your statement would be nice. You indict the current press and then claim to be one. Apparently the only one that is doing it correctly. You indict Bush and then use as evidence ""you"" as the sole empiracle study. Am I a lawyer, no. Is this a DEBATE forum where evidence and analysis are used? YES!!!!!!!! This isn't just a discussion forum. People actually debate here and want evidence and sources for their points. Now, please provide some evidence other than you being denied a pass to prove that the press (in general) is controlled by the Bush administration. Yes, people are being held at Guantanomo. We are still an occupying force in that country and still waging a war on terrorism. Many prisoners have already been released. There were two such releases about three and four weeks ago. Somewhere close to 80 prisoners I think. I will look for the info and post later.","2003-compared-1984-a","09:38 AM","government-debates","25"

And they won't be detained forever, the Pentagon is in talks now to release all Taliban prisoners. The al Qaeda ones will face trial soon. Actually, several terrorists were on FBI watch lists. Had they gone through US Visit they would have been denied access initially. That could have delayed the plot or of had other effects. Might have even be able to get several others stopped by police for traffic law violations... The test program already denied access to 21 people on FBI watch lists.

You have yet to supply any evidence. I did make a comment comparing the two. You will note that I stated that we are still an occupying force in Iraq. We are also conducting a war on terror. I also stated that we have already begun releasing prisoners and then broker gave you further info. We have provided, evidence and analysis. So far you have stated that the Bush administration controls the entire press in this country. You base this on the fact that you were denied access to something. WHAH! But hardly proves that the Bush administration controls all press such as CNN or NBC or Fox or CBS or.............. You did not say we were going down that road you said, ""Now that the bush government has managed to get control of the media using the fear of terrorism as a means of censoring the free press, in other words there telling the american people what they think they would like to hear, not the real truth. "" NOte you said ""has managed"" past perfect tense which is a past event with future implications. Note that you also said ""get control of the media"" You are only now shifting your position to make it sound more reasonable. This shows that you really don't know what your talking about. Nowhere in your statement did you state that the Bush administration is beginning to get control of the media. You stated they had it. You based it on one denial, yours. You also beg the question of whether or not this practice existed previous to the Bush administration. You will note that many reporters were denied access by the Clinton administration, the Bush, Regan, Carter, Ford, Nixon, etc. Not evveryone gets access. It just isn't physically feasible or possible. I have given you strong analysis of your position and shown it to be very logically fallible and without any supportive evidence. Would you kindly do some research to support your claims.","2003-compared-1984-a","12:25 PM","government-debates","29"
