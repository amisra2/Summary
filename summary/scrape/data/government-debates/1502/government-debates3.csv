The story ran in the european press but was omitted, or should i say censored in the american edition.

The irony is you insist on hard facts and evidence, however the regime you seem to support did not need any evidence when deciding to invade iraq, conjecture and hearsay of WMDs was enough as one of the main reasons for the invasion. i would believe there were people like you who dismissed hitler and other dictators when they came to power and introduced policies which censored the press, i would also believe that they asked for hard evidence like you do.

The bush government lied about the WMDs and then prevented any real analysis of the claims by the press, in fact they themselves found it it difficult to get any real information.

I had a funny feeling you would mention the guardian, however there are plenty of sites, there was even an editorial on the CNN website regarding censoreship, but that was censored, i was told it was pulled of their site by government intervention, i cannot prove this though. It was also interesting the meeting between rumsfeld and Time magazine, apparantly he put immense pressure on them to name the person of the year, who he wanted, american soldier or something. All of what i said was first published and/or aired on non american media channels.

How did you determine who to release? On Fox news they called the released POW ""low security risk inmates"" in Britain they were called ""wrongfully accused"" The point is the US wants its citizens to be ignorant so they can slip things under the carpet no questions asked.

For example, when we were sending our troops to die in Nam, the Swedes were offerring them Asylum. They have some schools in which the students are involved in the decisions about how their schools are run. They have Socialized Medicinal Treatment for their people. They permit doctors to prescribe medications to terminally ill patients that want to die and end their suffering. They and all of Europe are not hung up over nudity and sexuality, as we are in the U.S. ---- I'm sure that there are several in the E.U. that I would enjoy living in and feel the government was more rational than our own, if I didn't have my roots here, Orwell was a visionary, far ahead of his time.

I recognize the need for domestic spying and survailence, at the present time. Acording to the FBI, they have wiped out 2/3rds of Al-Qaeda. That is a VERY impressive estimate. And I recognize it could be a completely wrong estimate, and recognize that Al-Qaeda is but 1 of a number of world wide terrorist organizations. During the 1960's and 70's there were a number of student organizations, and radical groups that we're anti-war, and were reacting to racism. The vast majority of the survailence done by the FBI/CIA was totally unjustified, and a stupid. And being anti-War myself, I didn't like the widespread domestic spying going on. After the War in the later 70's, 80's and 90's, there was no domestic terrorism, except the usual few nuts going around bombing Black Churches in the South, Shooting Abortion Doctors, and that kind of stuff. (Not nearly enough to justify any huge program of Domestic Spying..) Things are different today. We do have very porous borders. And a great many ways and methods to communicate messages, just as we are doing now. We also do have a problem with foreign and domestic terrorism. I recognize that. I worked in the WTC for 5 years and was greatly effected by 9/11. I recognize the need for a lot more monitoring that is going on now. It does NOT change the subject matter, nor the language I use in my communications, and it really doesn't bother me terribly, because I know that the FBI is concerned with people that are not going to write sh*t that bores them to tears. So, if the wanna listen to a boring phone call, or read my Bush-Bashing posts, they are entirely welcome to do so, and I feel in no way prevented fromdoing anything I always did. Naturally, at some point things will queit down for a very long time, and if it does, and there is no great benefit to the FBI having broad survailence powers, I would CERTAINLY not be in favor of those provisions of the Patriot Act, however, the prospect of that happening or not happening din no way changes my mind about the need for survailence today. Other aspects of the Patriot Act need refinement, as there have been too many reports of innocent people being kept incommunicado for long periods of time.","2003-compared-1984-a","02:08 AM","government-debates","45"
