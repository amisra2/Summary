Ignorance Is Strength: Anyone ever realize that the media and airwaves are all bias to support whatever the government dishes out? Anyone ever wondered why? The Republican administration haven't changed much since the days of Ronald Reagan i.e. famous names such as Rumsfield(current secreatary of defense who I swear I saw a picture of shaking hands with Saddam in Reagan's day), Colin Powell and the Bushes.(THE INNER PARTY) Through the years ignorant Americans never realized how much power these people really had. Whose to say we are brainwashed into patriotism of America like how the people of Oceania were brainwashed. They used statistics and telescreen we used the media. The FCC is the government agency that controls the air waves and the head of the FCC is Michael Powell(son of Colin Powell). Now do u think the media is really going to be totally bias? The government wants the people to be unawared and ignorant so they can do some of the evil stuff they do overseas and not be noticed. If u read some of the material on the internet that is not filtered by the fcc you would see the hypocracy of America because they use tatics similiar to what Hitler done in WWII, and yet the people never learn about due to American properganda. As far as the average citizen knows the US are the ""good guys"" so they never question their government. Freedom Is Slavery: Does free speak really exist in the United States?

General Tom Franks recently made the surprising statement that if weapons of mass destruction were used on the western world the people will probably question the constitution and they might abandon there lifestyle for a more miltiary style life. Anyone realize that Orwell predicted the same thing in 1984 he says the Great Purges of the fifties caused massive deaths and therefore led to the revolution in which the party took over. We today i believe are heading into the great purge it seems all over the world people are just looking for more violence. The violence will eventually led to revolution and revolution will lead to factors striving for power and factors will lead to an immortal oligarical collective government and a ""big brother."" War Is Peace: Today the war is being looked on by Americans as a ""liberation"" but i believe it more resembles a conquest. The Iraqis never asked for help and throughout history bad governing always led to revolution so the Americans really didn't need to go into Iraq at all. The only reason I can see in this war is revenge for 9/11 and Bush showing the world that America won't be pushed around, therefore, insuring peace in our homeland at the expense of hundreds of thousands of foreign people. Despite what i have said i am living in America and i am not trying to flame any society i am just scared that this country might lose its way and become George Orwell's greatest nightmare. America is today the easiest country to succeed in and live happily but things might change and i want to inform people if i can enlighten just 1 person with this message it will totally be worth it. Please post with commments do u agree or do u think i am paranoid.","2003-compared-1984-a","03:37 PM","government-debates","1"

Conservative news stations are only beginning to make inroads into broadcast media. Your statements are highly indicative of a person diagnosed with paranoid personality disorder (from any country). Not that the US is above God per se, but it is easily the best country on the planet in my opinion. As far as I know, we haven't put up fences to keep people in. Additionally, correct me if I am wrong, but wasn't Orwell british, and wasn't he specifically attacking political powers of England at the time he wrote 1984?","2003-compared-1984-a","04:13 PM","government-debates","2"

So much noise in fact that you cannot see the signal. 2) I don't know what your beef is with GE but unless you have a credible source to prove yourself, you have just loaded us up with hogwash. 3) NBC and Fox report in diametrically opposed biases. One cannot say they report the same thing. 4) you allude to what we are doing to the afghanis and iraqis but provide no actual information as to what is being done, or what your source is. It is innappropriate to make statements that are merely conjecture and not provide sources or information. The internet is a highly unreliable source of information. There is a lot of garbage out there. You should stick to reliable sources for your info. For instance, cliams made by someone named Hal on Halswebsite.com are not likely to be as reliable as some of the major world news outlets. Remember reuters is not a US company, neither is the BBC or the Jewish Voice or the hindustan times. You can find links to reputable news sources. You can compare and contrast. Basically your arguments hold no water.","2003-compared-1984-a","04:54 PM","government-debates","4"

As for your attacks on me and statements such as ""you can argue until your blue in the face"" they are ad hominem arguments, logical fallacies and carry no weight. Unless you provide evidence to support your position and logic to link it there is nothing more to debate. In case you haven't figured it out you are kind of new here. This is a debate forum. To debate one presents evidence and logic. I can say the pope buys handgrenades all I want, but until I provide evidence it has no weight in the argument and I lose the debate. I am trying to help you understand that you need to supply support for your statements. The everyone knows this is true argument is an appeal to a generality and is a logical fallacy. People on this board will call you on fallacies and without evidence so fast it will make your ehead spin.

"12-30-2003","1502",1,"None","None","None","George Orwell","29581","i think in my first post i pointed out that this war on terrorist won't end because the true fuel of terrorism is hate and we are using hate to stop hate which i can tell you now won't work. We can declare victory against terrorism at any time but the truth is the hate never stops and that hate might eventually lead to the death on both sides. Maybe then they'll call it the War on Hate or maybe the War of Reformation but whatever it is it started deep in the history of mankind when people hurt each other for power war starts. The name will change but i doubt this hatred we all feel towards foreigners who hate us will ever stop.

I believe the 3 things that made Oceania what it was in 1984 was the party slogans: ignorance is strenght and etc.. thats why i chose the syntax I did for the first post on this thread. Don't you see those principles are being practiced today.
