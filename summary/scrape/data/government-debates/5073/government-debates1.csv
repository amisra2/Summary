The mistaken thought that the ""heathens"" needed a new religion and the fact that the conquerors wanted the trade goods drove the various empires to expand their territories.

However, I think the outcomes in the world of today had the Empire not existed, might be more mixed than you are suggesting. Some former colonies would probably have prospered and developed democratic institutions etc. had they never had the ""benefits"" of imperial rule. For others, it could be argued that Britain gave them independence ""too soon"" - i.e. before they were economically viable and politically stable. Perhaps left undisturbed they would be in a worse situation than is the case right now (some African countries could be cited). Take what I suppose might be called the ""classic case"" of imperialism - India. Although the East India Company monopoly followed by the British government, to put it crudely, made lots of money from the subjugation of the indigenous peoples, some investments were made which have paid dividends for India since its independence. For example, the Indian railway system, some efforts at improving sanitation, medicine, the legal system, and education, etc. And not least, the legacy of the English language. So imperial rule in India wasn't a complete catastrophe - even from the point of view of someone like Gandhi, who acknowledged the good while criticising the bad.","how-different-would","10:01 AM","government-debates","8"

English would not be prevalent. I suspect that today's native Americans would have retained their tribal identities and languages, some would be peaceful, some would be warriors. Likely, the same would have occurred in the African/Asian countries. We'd still have warring factions and saber rattling as we do today. I believe the greatest benefit would have been the retaining of cultural identities without Britification or Frenchifying (or Dutchification). We'd have a more varied world of cultures. However, I don't believe human nature would be much different from what it is now. We'd still have the same variations from good to bad, kind to mean, meek to powercrazy, lazy to hardworking, etc. We just wouldn't be speaking English.","how-different-would","10:52 AM","government-debates","9"

I mentioned English as being a ""legacy"" left to India when the British departed : since this is now the lingua franca that ""oils"" the global economy, it confers many cultural and economic advantages on those who can speak it - just like Latin did in the days of the Roman Empire.","how-different-would","11:11 AM","government-debates","10"

But I also tried to balance the selfish imperialism with some undoubted benefits that the British left to India - even if these benefits were not really cases of altruism, but originally intended to assist the British Raj in its management of India. (The English language and a legal system based on the British model are examples). Your speculation about the earlier development of an infrastructure etc., seems to imply that the (retained) wealth of India would have been an adequate resource on which to build a modern technologically advanced state. I'm not sure that access to Western science through the presence of British colonial rulers wasn't a necessary condition for even the present level of Indian infrastructure. It is a matter of fact that India produces many first rate scientists and it would disingenuous to pretend that has nothing to do with the education system established in colonial times, and the language the British left behind.","how-different-would","12:43 PM","government-debates","12"
"05-06-2005","5073",1,"None","None","None","seppuku","117965","I wouldn't say that France had as much of colonial spirit in America as say Spain. Didn't France mostly explore and trade with the people that they encountered? However, Spain controlled Florida, the South-Western United States and Everything south of our modern border. Regardless, I think the problem of the colonial/imperialist era of our history wasn't limited to the nations involved, but rather the conquest of markets and religion. Colonialism/Imperialism has its modern decendent in market control still today, in the form of multinational corporations.

There is a pretty long history of science in India. I'm not an expert on pre-colonial India but I'm pretty certain it was not the primitive land you seem to think it was. Western science could have been obtained by other sources than colonisation. Japan is an alternative example of how trade with the west might have occured.","how-different-would","04:10 PM","government-debates","14"

If you were in the sciences up until the late 60s early 70s, you were smart to take a course in technical German.
