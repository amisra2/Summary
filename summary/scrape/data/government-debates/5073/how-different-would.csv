However, I think the outcomes in the world of today had the Empire not existed, might be more mixed than you are suggesting. Some former colonies would probably have prospered and developed democratic institutions etc. had they never had the ""benefits"" of imperial rule. For others, it could be argued that Britain gave them independence ""too soon"" - i.e. before they were economically viable and politically stable. Perhaps left undisturbed they would be in a worse situation than is the case right now (some African countries could be cited). Take what I suppose might be called the ""classic case"" of imperialism - India. Although the East India Company monopoly followed by the British government, to put it crudely, made lots of money from the subjugation of the indigenous peoples, some investments were made which have paid dividends for India since its independence. For example, the Indian railway system, some efforts at improving sanitation, medicine, the legal system, and education, etc. And not least, the legacy of the English language. So imperial rule in India wasn't a complete catastrophe - even from the point of view of someone like Gandhi, who acknowledged the good while criticising the bad.","how-different-would","10:01 AM","government-debates","8"

English would not be prevalent. I suspect that today's native Americans would have retained their tribal identities and languages, some would be peaceful, some would be warriors. Likely, the same would have occurred in the African/Asian countries. We'd still have warring factions and saber rattling as we do today. I believe the greatest benefit would have been the retaining of cultural identities without Britification or Frenchifying (or Dutchification). We'd have a more varied world of cultures. However, I don't believe human nature would be much different from what it is now. We'd still have the same variations from good to bad, kind to mean, meek to powercrazy, lazy to hardworking, etc. We just wouldn't be speaking English.","how-different-would","10:52 AM","government-debates","9"

But I also tried to balance the selfish imperialism with some undoubted benefits that the British left to India - even if these benefits were not really cases of altruism, but originally intended to assist the British Raj in its management of India. (The English language and a legal system based on the British model are examples). Your speculation about the earlier development of an infrastructure etc., seems to imply that the (retained) wealth of India would have been an adequate resource on which to build a modern technologically advanced state. I'm not sure that access to Western science through the presence of British colonial rulers wasn't a necessary condition for even the present level of Indian infrastructure. It is a matter of fact that India produces many first rate scientists and it would disingenuous to pretend that has nothing to do with the education system established in colonial times, and the language the British left behind.","how-different-would","12:43 PM","government-debates","12"

Didn't France mostly explore and trade with the people that they encountered? However, Spain controlled Florida, the South-Western United States and Everything south of our modern border. Regardless, I think the problem of the colonial/imperialist era of our history wasn't limited to the nations involved, but rather the conquest of markets and religion. Colonialism/Imperialism has its modern decendent in market control still today, in the form of multinational corporations.

Try not to let your tendency towards political correctness seek hidden meanings in what are attempts a giving a balanced account of historical events. British imperialism happened: it was not a completely baleful phenomenon. It had some beneficial outcomes even if they were not intended. English happens to be the lingua franca of science, economics, etc. I don't know whether it's uniquely suited to it. Do you ? It's obvious that other languages have an input: I'm not making a judgement about them.","how-different-would","07:55 AM","government-debates","18"

It has nothing to do with any innate suitability, just historical accident. The flexibility of english is actually a barrier to scientific understanding, look at the semantic arguments in the creation vs evolution forum for a demonstration of that. If India was not primitive, then surely it had the potential to benefit from western knowledge at a faster rate if it remained independent than it did from being occupied, once again I point to Japan as a clear example.","how-different-would","08:02 AM","government-debates","19"

That is an opinion that fits neatly into your assumptions about ""imperialism"", I would guess. ""Surely it had the potential to benefit"" etc. - a rhetorical question that presumes an answer of which you will approve. Why you point to Japan is rather mysterious: have you compared the actuality of the Japanese Empire (1941-45) to the relatively moderate rule of the British imperialists ? You do not seem to read the posts you respond to with adequate care. If you did, you might have noticed my sentence: "" British rule in India was exploitative: no question"".
