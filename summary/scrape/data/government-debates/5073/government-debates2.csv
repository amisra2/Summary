If you were in the sciences up until the late 60s early 70s, you were smart to take a course in technical German. Then for centuries it was Latin, wasn't it?","jim's trucking","118017","Scientific German is still in use. It's handy because the words are sometimes formed by continuing to add adjectives together. I've seen some German words that take up a whole line of print on a wide page.","how-different-would","05:42 PM","government-debates","16"

Some boards are pretty nazi about that. But, yeah, some laguages love to string words together into a single super word. I think Finnish has the record on the longest compound word. I dunno.

"05-07-2005","5073",2,"Jo Bennett","None","Do you think that English is in some way uniquely suited to the pursuit of science? There is a pretty long history of science in India. I'm not an expert on pre-colonial India but I'm pretty certain it was not the primitive land you seem to think it was. Western science could have been obtained by other sources than colonisation. Japan is an alternative example of how trade with the west might have occured.","Alan Ryan","118225","You choose to distort my post by your suggestion about a ""primitive land"": I neither said nor intended to imply as much. Try not to let your tendency towards political correctness seek hidden meanings in what are attempts a giving a balanced account of historical events. British imperialism happened: it was not a completely baleful phenomenon. It had some beneficial outcomes even if they were not intended. English happens to be the lingua franca of science, economics, etc. I don't know whether it's uniquely suited to it. Do you ? It's obvious that other languages have an input: I'm not making a judgement about them.","how-different-would","07:55 AM","government-debates","18"
"05-07-2005","5073",2,"None","None","None","Jo Bennett","118228","English is the ubiquitous language in a lot of fields. This is mainly due to British imperialism, and the global dominance of the US. It has nothing to do with any innate suitability, just historical accident. The flexibility of english is actually a barrier to scientific understanding, look at the semantic arguments in the creation vs evolution forum for a demonstration of that. If India was not primitive, then surely it had the potential to benefit from western knowledge at a faster rate if it remained independent than it did from being occupied, once again I point to Japan as a clear example.","how-different-would","08:02 AM","government-debates","19"

How do you know that historical accident rather than innate suitability accounts for the global dominance of the language ? That is an opinion that fits neatly into your assumptions about ""imperialism"", I would guess. ""Surely it had the potential to benefit"" etc. - a rhetorical question that presumes an answer of which you will approve. Why you point to Japan is rather mysterious: have you compared the actuality of the Japanese Empire (1941-45) to the relatively moderate rule of the British imperialists ? You do not seem to read the posts you respond to with adequate care. If you did, you might have noticed my sentence: "" British rule in India was exploitative: no question"". All I've said about India so far has been qualified to indicate my admiration and affection for the place.","how-different-would","08:23 AM","government-debates","20"

Well, sure you could construct a really long word in Swedish due to our tradition of writing words together (it actually makes much more sense than the english language where words are seperated seemingly at random). I`m sure I could create an even longer word than the one you just wrote (just replace the last word ""arbeten"" with ""arbetsgrupp"" for example). I don`t see why someone would do this seriously though. It seems to be a longstanding joke in military circles to create long words without any real point... The longest word I`ve seen being used in real life is stramarinkommandounderhllningsbattaljonen (eastern marine commando maintinance batalion). But even this one was really a military gag (even though the actual batalion do exist).","how-different-would","09:06 AM","government-debates","21"

And it's difficult to say. There a lots more, much worse of course.","how-different-would","11:00 AM","government-debates","22"

I don`t really see why ""dailyjob"" would be more complicated than ""daily job"". But I agree that German is confusing. By putting the verbs at the end of the sentances for example makes it very difficult to know what the person is saying until the entire sentence is completed. Something that certainly slows down conversation, at least for me..","how-different-would","11:06 AM","government-debates","23"
