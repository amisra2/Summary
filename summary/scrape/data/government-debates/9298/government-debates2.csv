Are you taking intellectual thought lessons from Easyrider's school of how to think like a second grader? (If you don't have my morality you don't have any!) There are valid SECULAR arguments for laws against those things. Those things hurt people. In the gays vs. people who discrimate against gays scenario a) arguments gay rights and gay marriage have absolutely no valid secular reasoning, b) the people getting hurt aren't those oppose homosexuality on moral grounds, it is homosexuals. You are dead wrong to to use government to hurt gay families. 100% WRONG. It is a mean spririted, selfish imposition of your faith and nothing more.","Bassman","242772","I'm not the one you'll have to answer to. They're based upon the moral Law that was given on Mt. Sinai.","my-magic-wand","01:27 PM","government-debates","16"

You need to come up with a valid SECULAR reason for government action - otherwise you are impeding on everyone else's religious freedom and flirting with theocratic facism.","my-magic-wand","03:38 PM","government-debates","17"

Sinai.","GodIsDead","242819","this is where you are confused, bassman. its just not true. its so rediculous. Are you sereosly suggesting that any justifcation for law is rooted in the ten commandments? here are some good arguments for why thats not true: -if the ten comandments were the basis for all law, then there could be no law prior to their existance, however there were laws before said event on Mt. Sinai against things like murder, and theivery -the ten commandments make no mention of rape -the ten comandments make no mention of lieing -if the ten commandments are the only one true absolute moral code as the result of divine inspiration, then they should be absolute. inconsistant with this though is the fact that there is much contraversy about their meaning.","my-magic-wand","07:31 PM","government-debates","18"

I give you better than Bassman, I give you a .250 batting average, which isn't bad if you were playing baseball, but you're not. Your first idea actually sounds great, but the rest are simply imposing your agenda on everyone else. Oil is not a necessity, Iraq cannot be solved by simply withdrawing immediately, and the religious right has a Constitutional right to voice their opinion, however obnoxious they may be.","Matthew S","242823","See it says congress shall make no law. It says nothing about the states. This is my idea to get added to the Michigan state constitution. I refrased the Marriage admendment. Really I don't see how any one who believes that the people have a right to vote on anything and everything should have a problem with this admendment. Remember let the people vote. Besides this admendment is amied at churrches and groups like focus on the family. people still would be able to voice their opinions as individules and with in thier churches. I actully believe that there are certain things that are to important to let the people vote upon.","my-magic-wand","08:41 PM","government-debates","20"

Or a vote on whether lynching gay people is legal. ""Democracy is 2 wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner"". We have a Constitution in place to guarantee that it takes at least 2 wolves and one sheep and not just 3 wolves and 2 sheep","my-magic-wand","09:01 PM","government-debates","21"

I am not one of those people that thinks everything should be voted on. My point with this is to let those people know that once you open that door everything including their religious freedom can be voted away by the majority. Those that push for a vote on my civil rights do not understand that it could be their civil rights that are voted away tomorrow. LOl either way the sheep is still eaten.","my-magic-wand","04:16 AM","government-debates","22"

Let's see you can marry the person of your chioce but not me. Sounds like you have a special right. I can be fired from my job because of who I am while you can not. Sounds like you have a special right. You and your female partner can go out and jointly adopt a child in several states gay people can not. Sounds like you have a special right. Up until several years ago I could have been are arested and thrown in jail for have sex with the person of my choice while you would not have been. Sounds like you have a spscial right.

I find it pretty hard to belive that your objection to sodomy, and your understanding of the state's objection to sodomy is compleatly a medical concern. if scientists found tommorow that sodomy was in fact a very helthy practice, would you chage yoru mind about it? also, by the way, do you not have any defense for your useless and incompleat ten comandments. i think its important to note, furthermore, that its not just the ten comandments - lieing and rape are condemed nowhere in the bible - except in duderotomy were harsh punishments are suggested for the victims of rape. How dose a person who relys on christian religon for all their moral belifes deal with that?","my-magic-wand","09:58 AM","government-debates","29"

And I seriously doubt that scientists, except those with a clear Leftist political agenda would contradict itself on the dangers of this practice. WOW!!! The strawman cometh!!! Lying not condemned?
