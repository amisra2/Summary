"12-12-2006","9298",3,"Bassman","242970","So can you, but the person must be of the opposite gender. Ummm, no. Federal and state laws prohibit that. Big freakin' deal! Reason: Sodomy is an unhealthy and destructive practice.","jitobear","242998","Great! Put your money where your mouth is - when your daughter grows up be sure to have her marry a gay man. I sure she will be blissfully happy. I mean who needs love and attraction in their marriage or relationships? Actually federal laws do not and several states also do not. There are many places that can legally discriminate in employment/housing/etc. against gays. So kids are no big deal. Can I have your your's? NOT! There are heterosexuals who do engage in sodomy and there are homosexuals who do not. Do you really think a straight, married couple would ever have been arrested for sodomy? The laws were against gays - regardless of what intimate act they may (or may not) have been engaged in. And even if this were they case - where are all the laws against drinking, fast food, caffeine, using too much salt, smoking, wearing high heel shoes, fragranced douches, make-up that clogs your pores, S&M (and a miriad of other kinks), chewing your fingernails, not wearing sun-block, giving your buddy a tatoo, cheap earings that infect your ears, allowing XXXXXX to continue to blather nonsense without getting smacked upside the head???? There is a miraid of unhealthy and destructive practices that people choose to engage in. Don't feed me that sodomy laws were enacted out of concern for health and well-being - they were discriminatory - nothing less and nothing more.","my-magic-wand","11:20 AM","government-debates","31"

Also, Rabbi Saul expounds further in I Cor. 6:9-10.","GodIsDead","243022","that is an excedeingly weak argument - considering that deriving the immorality of all forms of lieing from a condemation of ""bearing false witness"" pretty much requers a preconcived undersanding that lieing is immoral. and what about rape?","my-magic-wand","02:12 PM","government-debates","32"

But I'm going to settle it right now! Marriage, by definition, is a monogamous union between one man, and one woman, period! There is no heterosexual ""privilege"" here. This is the truth, which you categorically deny because it contradicts your lifestyle! The posts you make, berating evangelicals, bemoaning traditional marriage, seeking to oppress anyone and everyone (re. the majority) who disagrees with you is childish, to put it mildly. You're more interested in the here and now rather than the long trerm consequensces of your decisions and actions.","my-magic-wand","04:27 PM","government-debates","34"

Unfortunately, many on your side of the aisle wish to dilute the meaning and make it more confusing. And speaking of confusing, Matthew, aren't you the same person who believes extra-marital affairs (BKA adultery) are OK?","my-magic-wand","05:17 PM","government-debates","36"

Yes there is; you want marriage restricted to opposite sex couples. You want to exclude gay people from marriage. Thus maintianing your heterosexual privledge the deffintion from this site http://www.thefreedictionary.com/privilege Yet you have yet to prove how gay marriage harms any one in any way.

I believe if a married couple has an aragement for an open marriage that is their choice. Then again that is the difference between you and me. I would let people make thier own choices about their bodies, lives, sexual idenity, and sexual practices and you would force them to live by your standard and not their own.

Even though polygamy, incest, homosexuaility, and other perversions were noted in Scripture, this doesn't mean that God endorses them! God's plan for human sexuality was outlined for us this way. Gen. 2:24 spells out this:"" For this shall a man leave his parents for his wife, and the two shall be one flesh"". In the Creation account, Gen. 1:27 says that man was created in God's image.

Again, you only focus on the immediate and self-gratification rather than the long-term consequences. http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...light=Adultery <buzz> Wrong answer, as expected.

Do you really mean to suggest that God did not endorse Seths incest with his sisters? How about Jacob and his 2 cousins Leah, Rachel and servants?

When David committed adultery with Bathsheba and murdered her rightfully married husband, the baby they conceived out of that adulterous relationship died and their second son, Solomon, even though he was righteous, had evil offspring. These are the long term ramifications I'm talking about! No He doesn't! On the issue of God, He is so holy that Sin will not go unpunished. And that includes sexual deviance. Why do you think there is such a term as ""inbreeding""? That is when you have a child conceived in an incestuous relationship. That child has more genetic defects than a child conceived in a non-incestual relationship. This is one of the reasons incest is considered abuse in the eyes of the law!","my-magic-wand","05:56 PM","government-debates","42"

For the record, do you think black people are dirty and sinful? Do you hate jews? Are you a Nazi, White supremecist, Homophobe, racist, sexist etc., are you any of those?

Kind of like how I hold YOU accountable, with all your foul, ugly, hate mongering, Bible waiving preaching about gays, for contributing to physical violence that has been visited on my son because he has a gay father. Do you have any idea what hurtful, hateful, mean creature you are? My 12 year old suffers because of you - and people who think like you. Do you have a reason outside of the Bible that I do not and do not have to give one rat's XXX about?
