"12-09-2006","9298",1,"Matthew S","None","Bottom line I could solve outsourcing, high gas prices, high cost of rent, the sistuation in Iraq, and several other issues in 5 min if I had the power.","Matthew S","242669","I am brining this from another thread http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...7&postcount=24 In response to Judeau http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...1&postcount=26 1 outsourcing I would add a tarriff to all products of companies that have things made in factories outside the US with sub USA wages. You simply add the price that they would pay the workers here to the price of the goods being make elsewhere. Make it not cost effective for them to move maufacturing outside the US to save labor costs. 2 High gas prices You simply make illegal to sell oil over a certain price within the bounds of the USA. We regulate the price of electicity so this is no different. 3 The situation in Iraq You pull all foriegn troops out immediately. Then you turn Bush and Chaney over to the court to be tried for war crimes. 4 Stopping the Religious right Make it illegal for any religious organization or organizations with religious missions or statements to influence, support the creation of laws or create through ballot iniatives. This is what I would add to the constitution. To secure and preserve the benefits of religious freedom in our society; All laws weather in this constitution or created by the legislature, local authority, or penal code which are based on religious beliefs or proposed and supported by any religious organization past or present shall be removed and considered void. Further no religious group, church, or any organization that has a religious statement or mission, may indorse, propose, any legislation, politician, ballot initiative, or give any financial support to anything political or receive funding from any government agency for any purpose.","my-magic-wand","05:56 AM","government-debates","1"

To stop them from hurting any more gay people. They want to hurt our families they want to out law us and our families. They want to continue to discriminate against us. They think we are evil, diseased, sick people who don't deserve equality and protection under the law. Beside they are the ones who think that people should be able to vote on anything. Besides they can keep their opinions in thier churches and individuials can still speak out.

Besides lets look at this from a gay perspective To be ""bitchslapped by Islamofascist scumbags"" or to be bitchslapped by christofascist scumbags humm I do not see a difference. Either way gay people loose. The problem is that reactionary conservatives never learn. If we had not made them angry in the first place we would not have been attacked.

Do you have any idea what it is like to be homeless? It is very hard to look for a better job or go to school if you are hungry and living in a box, tent, or car. Seems to me that if we are trully fighting terror then we would take out all terrorist organizations and all countries that support terrorists. Including some religious nut job right wing militias in this country. Once again I have a different moral code which is just as equal to yours. Yet my moral code is being forced to be suservant to yours though laws that do not allow me to express my moral code. In other words; people who think that other peoples lives and sexual behavior somehow violates some out dated, and irrelevant moral code to please some God head are forcing that moral value on others who do not. Keep that out dated, and irrelevant moral code out of the laws.","Bassman","242757","Which is why you have shelters and agencies to help thos in dire need.

Sinai against things like murder, and theivery -the ten commandments make no mention of rape -the ten comandments make no mention of lieing -if the ten commandments are the only one true absolute moral code as the result of divine inspiration, then they should be absolute. inconsistant with this though is the fact that there is much contraversy about their meaning.","my-magic-wand","07:31 PM","government-debates","18"

I wish I had known about it sooner so I could have tossed in my 2 cents before it turned into a gay rights conversation. I wanted to know about the world issues that Matthew S was going to solve with his magic wand. In response to those, a tariff that would make foreign labor equal to that in the US?!? Do you want to kill expansion altogether? Through capitalism, the way to overcome is to grow. Our economy would probably be cut in half if you were to impose that tariff. I can see it now, I would be out of a job for sure. My job is in investments and mutual funds. If the DJIA were to fall 6,000 points in a day, people would liquidate their investments, and businesses would go out of business all over the place. Prices would sky rocket while money supply initially would not. The FED would try and pump up the money supply to combat the incredible losses which would cause inflation to roar forward as well. People's situation would become misreable. I guess that tariff that causes equaling of wages would go away. Here in the US we'd be lucky to make pennies an hour. Unless inflation took over and we would be making 100s of dollars an hour with the real value of a few pennies an hour. Closely following would be the collapse of our currency and the probable infighting from fear. All retirement plans are washed out. Remember Hoovervilles? We could call the new ones, Matthewvilles except they would probably be far worse off. And you think the condition would only be limited to the US? No sir. The effects of such a dramatic crash would be felt worldwide throwing every nation with an economy into a financial dark ages that would take decades to recover from. My advice to everyone if Matthew S stumbles upon a magic wand, buy gold. Not gold stock, I mean physical gold. It'll be the only thing that hold value after the catastrophe that would have been released upon the earth. I do not really remember the rest of the stuff that Matthew S mentioned because I forgot it after I read the other 40 or so posts. I do not want to get into a gay rights conversation though. My thoughts on it generally tend toward what Bassman says but I do not want to talk about it because it doesn't really interest/concern me and it is not why I wanted to enter this thread. One last thing though. What the hell is all this predjudice bullcrap shooter? Where did any of this come from? I read the entire thread and NOTHING they have been talking about pertains to the hate of Jews and blacks. Do not throw this ad hominem mental excrement into their conversation. They are disagreeing on an issue and presenting what they think/feel and there is no room for that garbage.","Matthew S","243204","I am talking about companies going to mexico, china, or india where they can pay people a fraction of what they can pay people here.

There is a major part of the economy you are forgetting. The stock holders. They want to see profits. People won't invest with you if you cannot show increasing profits. By moving to another country, the companies can cut down on their ATC (Average Total Cost) so more money will be invested with them which allows for more expansion and an upward spiral trend is established. Cost cutting it important. Your method does not help the people in the other countries either. The business will not go there for their labor so they have little to no economic activity. The investor back in the USA does not get any benefit either. Neither does the company. All that happens is the economy (global and US) shrinks. It is an all around bad idea. Getting government out of the picture is better for the economies. But a little regulation every once in a while might be necessary. 2.) No no. We let the invisible hand set prices. That will also eventually propel us into using something different from gasoline one day. If you set a ceiling on the gas prices and the price of oil and the cost refining it plus any taxes exceeds the price allowed to be charged then gasoline stations are going to fold up all over the place. It is different from region to region as well. In CA, the gas price is much higher than here in AL. So, is this a federal regulation or a state one? And if the prices need changing do you change the ceiling? If you do, then what is the point of the ceiling in the first place? And if you are just trying to target profits, why? Should no company be allowed to make money. Ya know if that happens, we are all boned. 3.) Ok wait a second here. Do you think that as soon as we leave, all the Shiites and Sunnis are going to all form a big circle holding hands and sing Kumbaya? No way. Iran will walk in there and smash the fledgling democracy.

What if there was a gay country out there that decided to invade kansas to take out fred phelps or Virginia beach to take out Pat robertson. The country is is stronger then the US and decides to root out all anti gay activity with in the country. So it decides to keep its troops in the US and starts to build permenant bases so it can keep an eye on anti gay flare ups.

But it is how capitalism operates and it is why you and I are living as well as we are. If it is something illegal, like cooking books, then most definitely it must be stopped. But if a company wants to go in a certain direction, then by all means let them go that way. Use economic forces against them if you don't like it and don't support them. If enough people think like that then there is no way they will succeed. Another way to keep companies in the United States is to change all of US manufacturing into a completly automated system. I'm talking an entirely cyber nation. After the initial installation, that will be by far the cheapest labor. I'm sorry for the person who is out of a job, but it is not the government's responsibility to set them up with another one. If they are disabled, and are unable to find a job, then the government can help out but if they are able bodied people then it is up to them to get a job. By the way, the reason that gas prices have gone up so much is not solely because of American problems. The enormous increases in demand from nations like China and India have put immense strain on oil prices. No one was feeling sorry for the oil companies when oil was $20 a barrel. Why should they be punished now once their commodity has finally become very expensive and in ultra high demand? At the Iraqi's first election, terrorist threatened to kill them if they went out and voted. Their method of voting was dipping their finger in a dellible ink that was not easy to wash off so it was quite evident for a couple of days whether or not one voted. Under threat of DEATH, 72% of Iraqi's went to the polls and voted. If that does not show that the Iraqi's want a democracy, I don't know what does. If we are to pack up and leave tomorrow, Iran will roll in and not allow that democracy that they want and were willing to participate in under threat of death. And no, my ego does not need to be fulfilled. Then finish it the right way where people will take you seriously. Come up with a strategy, not just blanket ideas like eradicate the opposition.

The consequence for this is higher prices for all goods and services, especially for basic imported goods such as clothes, harming primarily low income earners. The economic case against tariffs is so firm you may as well toss out all of economic theory as try and ignore it. Overall employment should show no change or decline depending on minimum wage levels, as increased jobs in some formerly import markets (eg clothing manufacture) are counterbalanced by reduced jobs in export markets. Consequence: Shortages proportional to the difference between the market value of oil and the government decreed price of oil. Why would Iran ship the US oil it could sell for a higher price in Europe? Did you think about this at all? If you're going to make claims about economic policy you could do with at least a basic understanding of economics. I recommend Henry Hazlitt's ""Economics in one lesson"", which isn't exactly teaching you economics as a whole, but explains basic fallacies in economic reasoning held by the layperson in simple english.

The guilty scumbag that kidnapped, raped and murdered an 11-year-old girl should be executed for the crime.","Shooterandproud","243738","Trivializing pregnancy once more, when you yourself are a MAN. That disgusts me. The thing is, there is no helpless child dying. That a myth made by the pro-life movement. Thats a complete contradiction. Thats nitpicking who gets to live and who gets to die. But why? Because you are angry at him? You call death justice?","my-magic-wand","02:12 PM","government-debates","83"

Notice that the pro-lifers care very much about a small group of cells, but many support hunting, which does kill LIVING, BREATHING, SENTINENT, CONSCIOUS, beings which ARE murdered for personal recreation, when many times a whole woman's future can depend on an abortion. Notice that many pro-life supporters also support the death penalty which does murder fully formed humans. Your logic can be used and twisted in so many ways that you could use it against anyone, and i consider it a moot point. Don't be talking, as i don't think you're right-wing utopia will be any better.","Steeeeve","243842","Way to change the subject and not address the claim (even if it were in a sarcasist manner). Nevertheless, your post is one big strawman and yet you seem ok with this but in the very next post on the forum you call someone out on a strawman (eventhough it wasn't)....atleast the part you quoted to respond to wasn't. Let's review! You made an arbitrary claim that IQ, intelligence, and ""human traits"" were not present in an embryo and thus not deserving of human right status. I responded in a sarcasist manner that scientists once thought the same things about blacks. You responded by saying pro-lifers (me) support hunting and the death penalty and not abortion and then say you ""twisted by logic"" on me. So which one of these seems out of whack? That's right! Your post. First off, if someone supports the death penalty and/or hunting then this doesn't make abortion any more or less wrong and it doesn't make their view on abortion and more or less right. At best you are just trying to attack the person and not the issue of right and wrong. Second point: what logic did you twist to get to those points? This is where the strawman comes into play. The only way you could have made that post saying you used my logic is to change my logic to something it was not and thus we have a strawman. You can't go from ""scientists don't get to make claims on moral things"" (the very basic logic I had there) to ""you have inconsistent thinking therefore you are wrong"". I'm sure you won't understand though as you make the same claims over and over which are consistently logically flawed. huh? Did I even say anything about my ideas....either way, any idea I had would be better than Matthew S's....in fact, drawing ideas out of a hat would probably end up better.","my-magic-wand","01:47 PM","government-debates","84"

However, whenever you cannot refute another's argument, you call strawman. As we've seen, you're doing it again here. Aha! Look, a strawman! Please state where I said anything about ""IQ"". Where? It made so much more sense than your posts. What I said is that you value the life of a non-sentient being, but still support mindless killing through the Death penalty, and even though I agree with hunting, it is still the killing of a sentient being, a status that the embryo has not reached yet. Correct, however I never said anything about ""wrong"" or ""right"". I said it would be hypocritical to condone the killing of a sentient being but try to protect non sentient beings, even though it hurts women massively. This only tells me that you do not care about life at all, contrary to popular belief. I still see no strawman. All I see is you struggling to fabricate one so you can think of an excuse to ignore my arguments. Yet you parade around shouting this without refuting my claims. No, however, you said them about mine. You imply that your right wing utopia is better than a left wing utopia. You just mentioned your ideas. You claimed they were ""better than Matthew S's"", and yet you state above that your ideas had no part in this?
