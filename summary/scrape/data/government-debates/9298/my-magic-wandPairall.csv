Or more to the point: Killing because it's more convinient! Sad indeed.","jitobear","243464","I am still wondering why in the hell you or anyone thinks they get to define what is and is not mere convenience in mine or anybody's life but your/their own. And leave it to a man to trivailize pregnancy. It ain't no big deal/It's just nine months. I don't ever hear that from women - not even the lifers. Arrogant . Anyway - you only like little Christian evangelical children. You seem to have no problem contributing to hostile environment for my son (or the children of any gay people).

Nonsense Iraq had nothing to do with terrorism. If you trully believe that we are waging a war on terror then why haven't we envaded palestine? Why haven't we taken out Hamas or any of these organizations? There is no war on terror there is only Bush's vendetta war on behalf of his Saudi friends.

America's economy is dynamic, not static. The problem arises when unions, with their outdated mentalities, make US companies either close up or move. It's called profit & loss, Matthew.

We have not had an attack on US soil in five years since 9/11 and numerous terror plots have been thwarted. I bet you won't sing the same tune when we get bitchslapped by Islamofascist scumbags who are hell-bent on the destruction of the entire West.

If you add a tarriff to the price of a good to make up for lower wages payed in the other country. Make it not worth moving jobs out. It is a simple soultion. I take you have never lost your job to outsourcing or downsizing? Yes but where is the market physically located? Can you prove that? Besides lets look at this from a gay perspective To be ""bitchslapped by Islamofascist scumbags"" or to be bitchslapped by christofascist scumbags humm I do not see a difference. Either way gay people loose. The problem is that reactionary conservatives never learn. If we had not made them angry in the first place we would not have been attacked. If you mess with a hornets nest expect to stung. Right now we are making things worse by staying in a place where we are not wanted. Oh I see so you want to dictate your standard to the rest of us? The only moral value anyone should ever follow is Do no harm to others and live and let live. In short every thing you want to do is permissable as long as it doesn't violate those two rules.
