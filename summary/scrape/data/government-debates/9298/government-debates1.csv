"12-09-2006","9298",1,"Matthew S","None","Bottom line I could solve outsourcing, high gas prices, high cost of rent, the sistuation in Iraq, and several other issues in 5 min if I had the power.","Matthew S","242669","I am brining this from another thread http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...7&postcount=24 In response to Judeau http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...1&postcount=26 1 outsourcing I would add a tarriff to all products of companies that have things made in factories outside the US with sub USA wages. You simply add the price that they would pay the workers here to the price of the goods being make elsewhere. Make it not cost effective for them to move maufacturing outside the US to save labor costs. 2 High gas prices You simply make illegal to sell oil over a certain price within the bounds of the USA. We regulate the price of electicity so this is no different. 3 The situation in Iraq You pull all foriegn troops out immediately. Then you turn Bush and Chaney over to the court to be tried for war crimes. 4 Stopping the Religious right Make it illegal for any religious organization or organizations with religious missions or statements to influence, support the creation of laws or create through ballot iniatives. This is what I would add to the constitution. To secure and preserve the benefits of religious freedom in our society; All laws weather in this constitution or created by the legislature, local authority, or penal code which are based on religious beliefs or proposed and supported by any religious organization past or present shall be removed and considered void. Further no religious group, church, or any organization that has a religious statement or mission, may indorse, propose, any legislation, politician, ballot initiative, or give any financial support to anything political or receive funding from any government agency for any purpose.","my-magic-wand","05:56 AM","government-debates","1"

To stop them from hurting any more gay people. They want to hurt our families they want to out law us and our families. They want to continue to discriminate against us. They think we are evil, diseased, sick people who don't deserve equality and protection under the law. Beside they are the ones who think that people should be able to vote on anything. Besides they can keep their opinions in thier churches and individuials can still speak out. This is aimed at churches and religious minded organizations that want to fight gay rights.","my-magic-wand","12:56 PM","government-debates","3"

How would it by telling companies that if you take jobs overseas you will not profit? How would it by telling the oil companies you can not make obscene profits by gouging people?

It doesn't take a genius to know that business expansion adds jobs. Look at Toyota, for example. They've invested literally millions in plants here in the US and as a result, have added good paying jobs. First, it's the simple law of suppy and demand. With India and your commie buddies in China needing more and more of that black gold, then the market needs to adjust accordingly. And thus making the US completely unable to prosecute the War on Terror. Do you advocate another attack on the US, Matthew?? This is an offensive generalization.

They move production to India or China so they can pay people less. Nonsense again the oil rich countries have to sell their oil in a market and where is that market physically located? Nonsense Iraq had nothing to do with terrorism. If you trully believe that we are waging a war on terror then why haven't we envaded palestine? Why haven't we taken out Hamas or any of these organizations? There is no war on terror there is only Bush's vendetta war on behalf of his Saudi friends. As if the religious right in itself isn't offensive. They are offensive, they make generalizations, and they and the contingent organizations are evil, anti gay, and hatefilled. Why?

America's economy is dynamic, not static. The problem arises when unions, with their outdated mentalities, make US companies either close up or move. It's called profit & loss, Matthew. But I guess since you've been spoon-fed Socialism, you have no understanding of basic economics. Bunk! Oil is also sold on the commodities markets. Wrong again! We have not had an attack on US soil in five years since 9/11 and numerous terror plots have been thwarted. I bet you won't sing the same tune when we get bitchslapped by Islamofascist scumbags who are hell-bent on the destruction of the entire West. Wrong yet again, looks like your batting averege is .000 Matty. The problem is that America got away from The Standard of right and wrong. No, I'm a long term (and supporting) member there as well and I'm saying you wouldn't last five minutes there.","my-magic-wand","06:32 PM","government-debates","10"

If you add a tarriff to the price of a good to make up for lower wages payed in the other country. Make it not worth moving jobs out. It is a simple soultion. I take you have never lost your job to outsourcing or downsizing? Yes but where is the market physically located? Can you prove that? Besides lets look at this from a gay perspective To be ""bitchslapped by Islamofascist scumbags"" or to be bitchslapped by christofascist scumbags humm I do not see a difference. Either way gay people loose. The problem is that reactionary conservatives never learn. If we had not made them angry in the first place we would not have been attacked. If you mess with a hornets nest expect to stung. Right now we are making things worse by staying in a place where we are not wanted. Oh I see so you want to dictate your standard to the rest of us? The only moral value anyone should ever follow is Do no harm to others and live and let live. In short every thing you want to do is permissable as long as it doesn't violate those two rules. Then why do you not use your own advice since I have seen you admonished dseveral times by others for you generalizations, and redirection.","my-magic-wand","07:39 PM","government-debates","11"

It is not the Government's responsibility to provid you with a job, it is exclusively your own responsibility to get up off your kiester and either go back to school or go out and look for a job. And if the job doesn't pay well?? See above Actually no, Violating the moral Law of G-d is sin, and sexual conduct clearly falls under that purview.","my-magic-wand","07:52 PM","government-debates","12"
"12-10-2006","9298",1,"Matthew S","242749","It is not so easy as you seem to think. You have no idea what it is like not to be able to afford to go to school. Do you have any idea what it is like to be homeless? It is very hard to look for a better job or go to school if you are hungry and living in a box, tent, or car. Seems to me that if we are trully fighting terror then we would take out all terrorist organizations and all countries that support terrorists. Including some religious nut job right wing militias in this country. Once again I have a different moral code which is just as equal to yours. Yet my moral code is being forced to be suservant to yours though laws that do not allow me to express my moral code. In other words; people who think that other peoples lives and sexual behavior somehow violates some out dated, and irrelevant moral code to please some God head are forcing that moral value on others who do not. Keep that out dated, and irrelevant moral code out of the laws.","Bassman","242757","Which is why you have shelters and agencies to help thos in dire need. Now, I have no problem with government assistance here. My problem is where you have able-bodied people, who are able to get up off their lazy keisters, unwilling to seek employment. [quote]Give up on the wra on terror or did my point hit home? Care to answer the post from post 8 http://www.4forums.com/political/sho...07&postcount=8 Absolutely not! I wonder that myself, but I do not reject that Iraq is a theater in the overall WoT No argument there. Then we should remove the incest, rape, pedophilia, adultery, murder, thievery, assault, and other moral laws because they don't fit in with your ""code"" of moral relativism.","my-magic-wand","09:09 AM","government-debates","14"

Knock it off. Are you taking intellectual thought lessons from Easyrider's school of how to think like a second grader? (If you don't have my morality you don't have any!) There are valid SECULAR arguments for laws against those things. Those things hurt people. In the gays vs. people who discrimate against gays scenario a) arguments gay rights and gay marriage have absolutely no valid secular reasoning, b) the people getting hurt aren't those oppose homosexuality on moral grounds, it is homosexuals. You are dead wrong to to use government to hurt gay families. 100% WRONG. It is a mean spririted, selfish imposition of your faith and nothing more.","my-magic-wand","09:57 AM","government-debates","15"
