"12-15-2006","9298",6,"Steeeeve","243523","And you only began to cover the problems with Matthew S's ""plan for the world"". I guess the silver lining here is that if you thought it couldn't get any worse than it is now, it can....with Matthew S in charge.","Shooterandproud","243672","Don't be talking, as i don't think you're right-wing utopia will be any better.","my-magic-wand","11:32 PM","government-debates","76"
"12-15-2006","9298",6,"Bassman","243620","Yeah?? And being a father is what to you?? Oh that's right. You have nothing but disdain for the proper family unit!! Oh put a sock in it Jito, you have a problem with anything that doesn't fit into you ultra-leftist socialist philosophy. As a matter of fact, I work in a youth ministry with children from broken homes, so once again do not assume You just make an XXX out of U and ME!!","Shooterandproud","243673","Proper family unit my rear end, all I see in that statement is prejudice and hate. Yes i mean gays, as i doubt you consider gay domestic parters adopting a child of their own a ""proper family unit"". Wow, point dodge #3, blind swing #2 and strawman #3. Nice, i think the only person you made an XXX out of is yourself.","my-magic-wand","11:35 PM","government-debates","77"
"12-15-2006","9298",6,"Bassman","243652","Fact of the mater is homosexual ""families"" breed confusion in impressionable minds, especially in children.. How is a booy supposed to know how to be a good (and Godly) husband/father if he's raised by homosexual males?? or how is a little girl supposed to be the ""help-mate"" to her husband if she is being raised by lesbians?? No, Jito. With all due respect, it is nothing but a counterfeit. I know you feel strongly to the contrary, but this is the truth. Spiritually and practically.","Shooterandproud","243674","You're right. How is a child raised in a black family ever going to learn how to marry a white? God forbid!","my-magic-wand","11:37 PM","government-debates","78"

They aren't confused, hurt or threatened by their parents. Any damage is done by ""morally elite"" like you. You insult their families and turn your back when they get hurt by your hate because having your precious homophobia justified means more to you than these kids. First of all - keep your faith out of my life. This is America remember? Or are you proposing forced Christian upbringing to all children born in the USA? Don't really like freedom? That said - lets move past the religious implications of this sentence and into its fallacy. Who you take to bed, doesn't make you good or bad. My son's father is loving, generous, kind, hard-working, helps with homework, teaches my son about cars, carpentry, and fishing. He takes him along when he volunteers, or goes to help his mother or partner's mother. They do go to movies, bowling, do yardwork, chop wood, are taking gun safety together, throw the ball around, go to porefessional sporting events (although I'm the bigger basketball fan - dad can do the baseball and football, my sister does the hockey thing). Am I blowing apart any stupid stereotypes you have? I sure as hell hope so. Is this your big dream for your little girl? Whatever will you do if she wants - I dunno - to be a doctor or dancer or singer or scientist or SINGLE? My family is not counterfeit. And at least we are not evangelical - where the men are so cowardly that they need door mats for wives and they raise their children to think its OK to beat up, threaten, and force garbage down the throat of those children in gay families since (as you have clearly demonstrated here) not ALL children matter. I thank GOD everyday that my family doesn't love like that. I don't find it to the contrary - I know your dead wrong.","my-magic-wand","12:14 AM","government-debates","79"

I am angry that you killed that person, so now i will make you suffer and die. Barbarism.","Bassman","243690","Because abortion is a multi-billion dollar government funded industry who'll stop at nothing for the almighty dollar on the altar of ""choice"". So they'll deceive and coerce scared, impressionable women with the lie that if they get ""rid"" of their problem, everything will be roses and sunshine. And they are dead wrong: Abortions leave lasting psychological, mental, and spiritual trauma that may never heal. Also, the physical ramifications of abortion are too important to ignore. Hemmoraging, sterility, increased risk of cancer, hormonal imbalance, the list can go on. abortionfacts.com No, justice. The difference between this and abortion is that the helpless child did nothing wrong to deserve death. Society has a moral and legal obligation to protect life and to punish wrongdoing up to and including death. The guilty scumbag that kidnapped, raped and murdered an 11-year-old girl should be executed for the crime.","my-magic-wand","01:28 AM","government-debates","81"

You forget that not everyone is a right wing brainwashed evangelical christian. Some people don't view marriage and families in those terms. Besides what we are talking about is a piece of paper issued by the state. Gays and Lesbians are already creating the families of our choice and there is nothing that can be done about that. It is only your opinion that her family is counterfiet as seen though the eyes of your religious beliefs which Jito doesn't share.","my-magic-wand","05:53 AM","government-debates","82"

That disgusts me. The thing is, there is no helpless child dying. That a myth made by the pro-life movement. Thats a complete contradiction. Thats nitpicking who gets to live and who gets to die.

"12-17-2006","9298",6,"Shooterandproud","243657","Good thing scientists thought plants were not life forms deserving of rights.[/sarcasm] Notice that no nut jobs are equating plants to humans, although you're coming awfully close to it. Notice that the pro-lifers care very much about a small group of cells, but many support hunting, which does kill LIVING, BREATHING, SENTINENT, CONSCIOUS, beings which ARE murdered for personal recreation, when many times a whole woman's future can depend on an abortion. Notice that many pro-life supporters also support the death penalty which does murder fully formed humans. Your logic can be used and twisted in so many ways that you could use it against anyone, and i consider it a moot point. Don't be talking, as i don't think you're right-wing utopia will be any better.","Steeeeve","243842","Way to change the subject and not address the claim (even if it were in a sarcasist manner). Nevertheless, your post is one big strawman and yet you seem ok with this but in the very next post on the forum you call someone out on a strawman (eventhough it wasn't)....atleast the part you quoted to respond to wasn't. Let's review! You made an arbitrary claim that IQ, intelligence, and ""human traits"" were not present in an embryo and thus not deserving of human right status. I responded in a sarcasist manner that scientists once thought the same things about blacks. You responded by saying pro-lifers (me) support hunting and the death penalty and not abortion and then say you ""twisted by logic"" on me. So which one of these seems out of whack? That's right! Your post. First off, if someone supports the death penalty and/or hunting then this doesn't make abortion any more or less wrong and it doesn't make their view on abortion and more or less right. At best you are just trying to attack the person and not the issue of right and wrong. Second point: what logic did you twist to get to those points? This is where the strawman comes into play. The only way you could have made that post saying you used my logic is to change my logic to something it was not and thus we have a strawman. You can't go from ""scientists don't get to make claims on moral things"" (the very basic logic I had there) to ""you have inconsistent thinking therefore you are wrong"". I'm sure you won't understand though as you make the same claims over and over which are consistently logically flawed. huh? Did I even say anything about my ideas....either way, any idea I had would be better than Matthew S's....in fact, drawing ideas out of a hat would probably end up better.","my-magic-wand","01:47 PM","government-debates","84"

However, whenever you cannot refute another's argument, you call strawman. As we've seen, you're doing it again here. Aha! Look, a strawman! Please state where I said anything about ""IQ"". Where? It made so much more sense than your posts. What I said is that you value the life of a non-sentient being, but still support mindless killing through the Death penalty, and even though I agree with hunting, it is still the killing of a sentient being, a status that the embryo has not reached yet. Correct, however I never said anything about ""wrong"" or ""right"". I said it would be hypocritical to condone the killing of a sentient being but try to protect non sentient beings, even though it hurts women massively. This only tells me that you do not care about life at all, contrary to popular belief. I still see no strawman. All I see is you struggling to fabricate one so you can think of an excuse to ignore my arguments. Yet you parade around shouting this without refuting my claims. No, however, you said them about mine. You imply that your right wing utopia is better than a left wing utopia. You just mentioned your ideas. You claimed they were ""better than Matthew S's"", and yet you state above that your ideas had no part in this? A little red alarm is going off in my head.","my-magic-wand","05:55 PM","government-debates","85"
