"12-12-2006","9298",4,"Bassman","243067","Look! Even though polygamy, incest, homosexuaility, and other perversions were noted in Scripture, this doesn't mean that God endorses them! God's plan for human sexuality was outlined for us this way. Gen. 2:24 spells out this:"" For this shall a man leave his parents for his wife, and the two shall be one flesh"".","Shooterandproud","243102","Lol, are you going to start ranting about how being black is a perversion too? You're going to have to understand this someday, but the bible was written by people. Not god, not jesus, not whoever you wanted it to be. The fact of the matter is, there is no proof to support it was written by a supernatural being, or if a supernatural being influenced anyone to write it. Man has corrupted god's word.","my-magic-wand","07:22 PM","government-debates","46"
"12-12-2006","9298",4,"Bassman","243078","No He doesn't! On the issue of God, He is so holy that Sin will not go unpunished. And that includes sexual deviance. Why do you think there is such a term as ""inbreeding""? That is when you have a child conceived in an incestuous relationship. That child has more genetic defects than a child conceived in a non-incestual relationship. This is one of the reasons incest is considered abuse in the eyes of the law!","Shooterandproud","243103","Where the hell did you get the idea that ""sexual deviance"" is a sin? In that book written by MAN? Or did a supernatural being just tell you?","my-magic-wand","07:24 PM","government-debates","47"
"12-12-2006","9298",4,"Bassman","243078","You'll also note that there were consequnsces for their actions. When David committed adultery with Bathsheba and murdered her rightfully married husband, the baby they conceived out of that adulterous relationship died and their second son, Solomon, even though he was righteous, had evil offspring. These are the long term ramifications I'm talking about! No He doesn't! On the issue of God, He is so holy that Sin will not go unpunished. And that includes sexual deviance. Why do you think there is such a term as ""inbreeding""? That is when you have a child conceived in an incestuous relationship.

He had to have sex with his sisters if you believe the genesis account to be true. Not to mention Cain and his wife no one has ever explained where his wife came from.","my-magic-wand","08:12 PM","government-debates","48"
"12-13-2006","9298",4,"Judeau","243202","Wow, this thread materialized quickly. I wish I had known about it sooner so I could have tossed in my 2 cents before it turned into a gay rights conversation. I wanted to know about the world issues that Matthew S was going to solve with his magic wand. In response to those, a tariff that would make foreign labor equal to that in the US?!? Do you want to kill expansion altogether? Through capitalism, the way to overcome is to grow. Our economy would probably be cut in half if you were to impose that tariff. I can see it now, I would be out of a job for sure. My job is in investments and mutual funds. If the DJIA were to fall 6,000 points in a day, people would liquidate their investments, and businesses would go out of business all over the place. Prices would sky rocket while money supply initially would not. The FED would try and pump up the money supply to combat the incredible losses which would cause inflation to roar forward as well. People's situation would become misreable. I guess that tariff that causes equaling of wages would go away. Here in the US we'd be lucky to make pennies an hour. Unless inflation took over and we would be making 100s of dollars an hour with the real value of a few pennies an hour. Closely following would be the collapse of our currency and the probable infighting from fear. All retirement plans are washed out. Remember Hoovervilles? We could call the new ones, Matthewvilles except they would probably be far worse off. And you think the condition would only be limited to the US? No sir. The effects of such a dramatic crash would be felt worldwide throwing every nation with an economy into a financial dark ages that would take decades to recover from. My advice to everyone if Matthew S stumbles upon a magic wand, buy gold. Not gold stock, I mean physical gold. It'll be the only thing that hold value after the catastrophe that would have been released upon the earth. I do not really remember the rest of the stuff that Matthew S mentioned because I forgot it after I read the other 40 or so posts. I do not want to get into a gay rights conversation though. My thoughts on it generally tend toward what Bassman says but I do not want to talk about it because it doesn't really interest/concern me and it is not why I wanted to enter this thread. One last thing though. What the hell is all this predjudice bullcrap shooter? Where did any of this come from? I read the entire thread and NOTHING they have been talking about pertains to the hate of Jews and blacks. Do not throw this ad hominem mental excrement into their conversation. They are disagreeing on an issue and presenting what they think/feel and there is no room for that garbage.","Matthew S","243204","I am talking about companies going to mexico, china, or india where they can pay people a fraction of what they can pay people here. The solution is force them to bring those jobs back into the country. You take away their advantage of moving maufacturing to the other country by adding, or a better idea would be a tax, the price of what they would have payed people here to make the same product. So here is how it works a company here pays a worker 10$ an hour then it moves that job to another country and pays a person 10$ day. Based upon an 8 hour day the savings to the company is 70$ per day. Now you add up how many workers were displaced by the company moving then just either tax, tarrif, or fine the company 70$ a day times the number of workers. Now the company is free to still move but there won't be labor savings advantage. Here is the rest of the first post 2 High gas prices You simply make illegal to sell oil over a certain price within the bounds of the USA. We regulate the price of electicity so this is no different. 3 The situation in Iraq You pull all foriegn troops out immediately. Then you turn Bush and Chaney over to the court to be tried for war crimes. 4 Stopping the Religious right Make it illegal for any religious organization or organizations with religious missions or statements to influence, support the creation of laws or create through ballot iniatives. This is what I would add to the constitution. To secure and preserve the benefits of religious freedom in our society; All laws weather in this constitution or created by the legislature, local authority, or penal code which are based on religious beliefs or proposed and supported by any religious organization past or present shall be removed and considered void. Further no religious group, church, or any organization that has a religious statement or mission, may indorse, propose, any legislation, politician, ballot initiative, or give any financial support to anything political or receive funding from any government agency for any purpose.","my-magic-wand","12:41 PM","government-debates","50"

Congratulations on making the employment rate 10 times higher than France's. You want a real solution? WORK FOR LESS MONEY. Perhaps you really don't need all the things you claim you need.

There is a major part of the economy you are forgetting. The stock holders. They want to see profits. People won't invest with you if you cannot show increasing profits. By moving to another country, the companies can cut down on their ATC (Average Total Cost) so more money will be invested with them which allows for more expansion and an upward spiral trend is established. Cost cutting it important. Your method does not help the people in the other countries either. The business will not go there for their labor so they have little to no economic activity. The investor back in the USA does not get any benefit either. Neither does the company. All that happens is the economy (global and US) shrinks. It is an all around bad idea. Getting government out of the picture is better for the economies. But a little regulation every once in a while might be necessary. 2.) No no. We let the invisible hand set prices. That will also eventually propel us into using something different from gasoline one day. If you set a ceiling on the gas prices and the price of oil and the cost refining it plus any taxes exceeds the price allowed to be charged then gasoline stations are going to fold up all over the place. It is different from region to region as well. In CA, the gas price is much higher than here in AL. So, is this a federal regulation or a state one? And if the prices need changing do you change the ceiling? If you do, then what is the point of the ceiling in the first place? And if you are just trying to target profits, why? Should no company be allowed to make money. Ya know if that happens, we are all boned. 3.) Ok wait a second here. Do you think that as soon as we leave, all the Shiites and Sunnis are going to all form a big circle holding hands and sing Kumbaya? No way. Iran will walk in there and smash the fledgling democracy. Then oil will sky rocket completely shooting down the #2 idea. I will say that the way the war was carried out was done poorly. The plan once we were there was shaky at best. It was executed poorly because America is too worried about what the ninnies from the rest of the world are thinking. But we are there now. Leaving would be a mistake and would show incredible weakness for one, and would leave the Iraqis to be subject to Iran rule, which would not be a very tolerant one much like the ""Butcher"" used to rule. I do not think they are war criminals. Perhaps poor tacticians but not war criminals. 4.) It's called money and popularity. There is a lot of money with the Christian base and there are a lot of voters there too. Should we tell the Episcopalian groups that lobby for gay rights to be silenced as well? No we shouldn't and we shouldn't do the same to the religious right. I garauntee if the religious right supported gay rights, you'd sing a different tune. You can't silence those who oppose you, you can only hope to overcome them.","my-magic-wand","01:32 PM","government-debates","52"

But it is how capitalism operates and it is why you and I are living as well as we are. If it is something illegal, like cooking books, then most definitely it must be stopped. But if a company wants to go in a certain direction, then by all means let them go that way. Use economic forces against them if you don't like it and don't support them. If enough people think like that then there is no way they will succeed. Another way to keep companies in the United States is to change all of US manufacturing into a completly automated system. I'm talking an entirely cyber nation. After the initial installation, that will be by far the cheapest labor. I'm sorry for the person who is out of a job, but it is not the government's responsibility to set them up with another one. If they are disabled, and are unable to find a job, then the government can help out but if they are able bodied people then it is up to them to get a job. By the way, the reason that gas prices have gone up so much is not solely because of American problems. The enormous increases in demand from nations like China and India have put immense strain on oil prices. No one was feeling sorry for the oil companies when oil was $20 a barrel. Why should they be punished now once their commodity has finally become very expensive and in ultra high demand? At the Iraqi's first election, terrorist threatened to kill them if they went out and voted. Their method of voting was dipping their finger in a dellible ink that was not easy to wash off so it was quite evident for a couple of days whether or not one voted. Under threat of DEATH, 72% of Iraqi's went to the polls and voted. If that does not show that the Iraqi's want a democracy, I don't know what does. If we are to pack up and leave tomorrow, Iran will roll in and not allow that democracy that they want and were willing to participate in under threat of death. And no, my ego does not need to be fulfilled. Then finish it the right way where people will take you seriously. Come up with a strategy, not just blanket ideas like eradicate the opposition. Otherwise, it just sounds like a rant which will fall on deaf ears.","my-magic-wand","02:49 PM","government-debates","54"
