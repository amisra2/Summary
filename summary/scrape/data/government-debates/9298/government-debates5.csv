And if an embryo or group of cells has no human traits or intelligence, then they do not share our rights. It can't really be unlimited, but it has to be in the boundries of common sense.","Bassman","243443","This is scary. This is exactly the same mentality which fostered Eugenics and subsequent Nazi Holocaust of the 1920s-1940s. Life worthy of life. Or more to the point: Killing because it's more convinient! Sad indeed.","my-magic-wand","08:23 PM","government-debates","61"

You cannot equate plants to humans, just as you cannot equate embryo's to humans. In fact, it is highly hypocritical of you to say such things, seeing that you are prejudice against gays. Jews have feelings and consciousness, and they were alive. They had a brain, and they had awareness, however an embryo could care less what happened to it. Just like a plant. You Crazy conservative christians can push your socialist anti freedom views all you want, and try to impose them upon poor women, and girls for that matter, who cannot care for children. What would someone like a 13 year old girl caring for 3 children, who is dirt poor, and is preganant with a fourth? What would you tell her? ""Sorry, those men over there say abortion is wrong, that means you cant have one, even though they are not respecting your opinions in any way."" With your logic, i can equate my kidney to a human being. Its stupid logic that can only hurt society.","my-magic-wand","10:21 PM","government-debates","62"

And leave it to a man to trivailize pregnancy. It ain't no big deal/It's just nine months. I don't ever hear that from women - not even the lifers. Arrogant . Anyway - you only like little Christian evangelical children. You seem to have no problem contributing to hostile environment for my son (or the children of any gay people). Your loving nature is just so damned convincing.","my-magic-wand","10:59 PM","government-debates","64"

"12-15-2006","9298",5,"Symbiote","243465","I will address only the two economic policies you chose. The consequence for this is higher prices for all goods and services, especially for basic imported goods such as clothes, harming primarily low income earners. The economic case against tariffs is so firm you may as well toss out all of economic theory as try and ignore it. Overall employment should show no change or decline depending on minimum wage levels, as increased jobs in some formerly import markets (eg clothing manufacture) are counterbalanced by reduced jobs in export markets. Consequence: Shortages proportional to the difference between the market value of oil and the government decreed price of oil. Why would Iran ship the US oil it could sell for a higher price in Europe? Did you think about this at all? If you're going to make claims about economic policy you could do with at least a basic understanding of economics. I recommend Henry Hazlitt's ""Economics in one lesson"", which isn't exactly teaching you economics as a whole, but explains basic fallacies in economic reasoning held by the layperson in simple english. Feel free to start here for tariffs: http://www.jim.com/econ/chap11p1.html and here for price fixing: http://www.jim.com/econ/chap17p1.html","Steeeeve","243523","And you only began to cover the problems with Matthew S's ""plan for the world"". I guess the silver lining here is that if you thought it couldn't get any worse than it is now, it can....with Matthew S in charge.","my-magic-wand","11:36 AM","government-debates","67"

And its quite arrogant mister , to tell me ANYTHING AT ALL about the realities of pregnancy. Between you and I - only one of us actually has been pregnant. Do not cowardly put words in my mouth when you don't have the nuts to address the point I actually raised.

How is a booy supposed to know how to be a good (and Godly) husband/father if he's raised by homosexual males?? or how is a little girl supposed to be the ""help-mate"" to her husband if she is being raised by lesbians?? No, Jito. With all due respect, it is nothing but a counterfeit. I know you feel strongly to the contrary, but this is the truth.

First off, using the term ""pro-abortion"", which is used by the pro-life crowd because they were crying that they were losing, so they made up some stupid name and tried to frame the other side. Many pro-choicers despise abortion, and are in no way ""pro-abortion"". It would be accurate to say ""pro-abortion rights"" or ""pro-legalization"", but ""pro-abortion"" is just a blind swing at the other side and only proves your ignorance. Many of us to hate abortion, but we despise men who have not expericned pregnancy and child birth trying to force women going through these tough times to carry out an unplanned pregnancy, possibly ruining their lives. Second off, calling any even slightly liberal statement ""socialist"". Another blind swing because the conservatives are crying that they lost. We don't call you anarchists do we? But, when a conservative is cornered and has run out of logical arguments (which is not uncommon), don't be surprised when he starts sputtering out things like ""pro-abortion"" or ""socialist"".","my-magic-wand","11:31 PM","government-debates","75"
