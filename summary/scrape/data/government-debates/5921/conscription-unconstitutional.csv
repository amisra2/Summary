The courts, however, have ruled that this power thumps the 13th Amendment. Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U.S. 366 (1918). The Court's analysis, in full, of the Thirteenth Amendment issue raised by a compulsory military draft was the following: ''As we are unable to conceive upon what theory the exaction by government from the citizen of the performance of his supreme and noble duty of contributing to the defense of the rights and honor of the nation, as the result of a war declared by the great representative body of the people, can be said to be the imposition of involuntary servitude in violation of the prohibitions of the Thirteenth Amendment, we are constrained to the conclusion that the contention to that effect is refuted by its mere statement.'' Id. at 390. While the Supreme Court has never squarely held that conscription need not be premised on a declaration of war, indications are that the power is not constrained by the need for a formal declaration of war by ''the great representative body of the people.'' During the Vietnam War (an undeclared war) the Court, upholding a conviction for burning a draft card, declared that the power to classify and conscript manpower for military service was ''beyond question.'' United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377 (1968). See also United States v. Holmes, 387 F.2d 781, 784 (7th Cir. 1968) (''the power of Congress to raise armies and to take effective measures to preserve their efficiency, is not limited by either the Thirteenth Amendment or the absence of a military emergency''), cert. denied 391 U.S. 956 Dono","conscription-unconstitutional","10:34 PM","government-debates","5"

Involuntary means not voluntary, and servitude means you are servinig. This has nothing to do with pay or anything else.","conscription-unconstitutional","10:38 PM","government-debates","6"

Is the intent taken into account, or are the words themselves considered to be sovereign?","doG","175832","Actually that's a pretty big debate/argument among some of us here. Generally constitutionalists believe the intent should always be the controlling factor of interpretation. Some believe it is more of a living document and that the intent should change with time. Constitutionalists believe that kind of negates the purpose or intent of the amendment process. I personally believe when someone sits to pen some rules or laws that it is not their intent that the interpretation of what they meant will change with time.","conscription-unconstitutional","07:55 AM","government-debates","11"

"12-07-2005","5921",1,"None","None","None","Obvious Child","183778","In any case, it depends what you mean by 'their intention'. At a very limited sense of 'what those words were used to mean', pretty much everyone would accept it. But there are two meanings (at least) to words in this sense. We have the same thing with common law in the UK For example: we still have the same corporal punishment law we've had for decades. It allows 'reasonable chastisement'. Now, that means 'the amount of chastisement considered reasonable', but in a more specific sense it might mean at the time of writing 'without breaking limbs or causing severe internal injury' and now mean 'without causing significant pain, or bruises of any kind'. One meaning remains, another changes.","conscription-unconstitutional","07:23 AM","government-debates","14"

"12-31-2005","5921",2,"None","None","None","Obvious Child","189081","I just realised that the way the Constitution is read has a remarakable parallel elsewhere. It is interpreted literally, then by the spirit, then by analogy. Finally, some trace back quotes to the writers of the Constitution or the founding fathers, to find the original meaning explained or lived out in them as paragons of constitutionalism. How very like the ways of interpreting the Qu'ran, and the use of accompanying Hadith literature.... I wonder if Muslims or American patriots would be more offended by this comparison. I can only hope the former.","conscription-unconstitutional","07:56 AM","government-debates","17"
