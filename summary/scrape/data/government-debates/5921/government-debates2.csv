Is the intent taken into account, or are the words themselves considered to be sovereign?","maco","187759","Depends on who's in the Supreme Court. Some go by intent and some go by letter. That's why we worry about who's appointed there.","conscription-unconstitutional","01:31 AM","government-debates","16"
"12-31-2005","5921",2,"None","None","None","Obvious Child","189081","I just realised that the way the Constitution is read has a remarakable parallel elsewhere. It is interpreted literally, then by the spirit, then by analogy. Finally, some trace back quotes to the writers of the Constitution or the founding fathers, to find the original meaning explained or lived out in them as paragons of constitutionalism. How very like the ways of interpreting the Qu'ran, and the use of accompanying Hadith literature.... I wonder if Muslims or American patriots would be more offended by this comparison. I can only hope the former.","conscription-unconstitutional","07:56 AM","government-debates","17"
