I don't see any major power in the world other than the US taking an aggressive military stance. We could reduce our military strength by 50% and still retain the capability of supreme defense based solely on nuclear warfare. Economics are the contemporary war, one that we're badly losing partially due to our out-of-proportion to tax base military commitment. I realize reducing US military capability would crash our economy, which brings up the question of now or later. Which is also the reason we continue our aggression as it feeds the GDP, that political gauge used to sooth the public and retain their confidence. Again; losing the economic war is a question of now or later. What surprises me is the lack of understanding by America's youth of their economic future being constructed as a house of cards consisting of public debt and trade deficits. If I were facing that, I'd be organizing political offense in no uncertain terms. Lack of personal responsibility seems to be the primary cause of that apathy. As to other whatever in the galaxy trouncing us, I agree with the other poster in that if they can get here and are aggressive, their technology makes any military resistance on our part pretty much a bad movie.","us-militariast","06:53 PM","government-debates","9"

With interest costs from prior military deficits, homeland security and DoE nuclear allocations, veteran benefits, Afghanistan and Iraq, military costs are closer to 45% of budget. Unless, of course, you prefer using current, direct military costs only excluding debt, allocations, Afghanistan and Iraq for public consumption as do politicians of both parties. 2. SS is not and has never been included in any federal budget. SS administration is a budget line item, but is a minor cost, has nothing to do with SS tax revenue or benefits and is included in human resources.

Besides which how would be able to attack a species that can move at such speeds in outer space where we only have one form of vessels capable of navigating about.

Secondly, a culture that is so technologically superior to ours that they can manage to traverse the distance between star systems, while we haven't even been able to send manned vessels past the moon. Also add to that the hazards inherent in traveling in outer space like micro-asteriods, something we've yet to devise a method of dealing with. Any culture with the technology to do those two things alone will be so much more advance than us that we wouldn't be able to defeat them. Some kind of shielding that is able to resist our conventional weaponry, the ability to choose the range of engagment, or whether or not to allow us to engage them at all, and even if we could, there is still the shielding. There are instances of cultures that were so technologically advanced over the culture they're fighting that the technologically inferior culture stood no chance in our own history. The Hittites and the Egyptians for instance, the Hittities who simply had the advantage of metal weaponry were easily able to defeat the Egyptians.","us-militariast","01:23 PM","government-debates","16"

"04-17-2005","4815",2,"Zardoz","None","[b]Nope, no acceleration for FTL flight. They use fairy dust gathered from their planet or worm holes that require little actual acceleration. Once they're on our planet, they're fair game. Think outside the box. For every imaginative scenario you can concoct to say 'we lose no matter what', I can make one up that says 'we have a fighting chance'. You're still useing human thinking to dictate how an 'alien invader' would invade. Hollywood and many sci-fi books often are humanocentristic. Heck, half the games I play and books I read are. So, it's no real wonder why many would think 'we lose simply cause they are advanced.' And, while left-right (have I used the term right yet?) is extremely subjective and lible to change (you could be a jack booted thug on another subject), it's an easy sterotype that many seem to perpetuate. If I throw a bunch of stones that have liberal (left) attitudes on them, and most hit you accuratly, then you'd be more liberal than conservative. The point, that many seem to over look is their posting styles. This thread is full of flame bait (of which I perpetuate) and garners no real debate. It's merely an 'I am right and you're wrong' ******* contest. All things considered, it's a very American mud-slingging contest. Seems to happen with most debate forums. Someone makes a claim as fact. That fact doesn't jive with others. Any proofs brought in by either side is ignored with a wand of causual dismissal (tm) as incorrect and biased propaganda. Why should I think anything different of this site? Already, there have been several debates (arguements) on this and other topics where one side simply dismisses the other. And, seeing that these types of web sites are primarily for entertainment, I chose to entertain myself...and anyone else who get's pleasure from my crass behavior. Occasionally, I'll nod my head and agree with something that another states, like on the subject of gay rights, where I'm a lefty. Or anti-abortion issues where I'm a righty and current allies become enemies and visa versa but, stand back and actually look at your debate styles. Some say any figures presented are false and juggled to support a position. When dealing with what-if sistuations like mythical alien invaders, the aliens have to think like humans...makes it easier I guess to concoct scenarios. *sigh* off to work to surmize the news...bunch of garbage that it is I'm sure.","StrategosFF","108294","Regardless of different they may be from us, there is no reason a race that can traverse from solar system would choose to engage an enemy on their grounds under circumstances that would not favor their victory. Yes its possible, and likely that an alien culture will develop differently than humanity, but FTL can not be the sole driving aim of any species that became dominate enough on a planet to have the resources at hand to create FTl vessels. So I am saying that if we are attacked by an alien species, we will not win, we may not lose, but we have no chance of victory, as we will be unable to strike at them, and they can choose to engage us at their leisure. I don't care how different your aliens may be, but no dominate species will choose to lose, otherwise they wouldn't have survived to become dominate, they may not think like us but that doesn't make them stupid. Back to my original post, we have yet to create a system that can reliably stop an object traveling at whatever speeds it is IBCMs travel at, so we need to advance our military, not enlarge it. A bigger military means more money being spent on trying to stay ""up-to-date"" which means that it will take longer for upgrades to reach the troops.

Bow and arrows vs British early machine guns? Not exactly fair. I wouldn't say ""no holds bar fight."" What is missing is the motivation to fight. Not to mention training. You may have the best weapons, but if your training is like the Iraqi National Guard, well, you're going to suck even with good equipment. Motivation is specifically a reaosn why we shouldn't be using mercenaries. Mercenaries are paid to fight.

Work on a new generation of combat vehicle and get some bitching about how the new device is not needed because a) what aready exist is good enough and STILL better than what we're facing b) a waste since it'll never be used in this day and age of relative peace c) is money better spent on social programs. Work on an offensive system and it either a) pollutes the environment and is an unclean weapon b) isn't needed for a number of reasons or c) is money better spent on social programs. Bottom line is you can't please everyone ever. So, if you want to get something done, ask for compromises. I'm willing to start with a 1% cut in the Military budget increasing to 5% over the next 5 years. We can use that money to beef the police and boarder patrols (<G>) Or devote it to child care programs. Help the wee lil children be healthy and educated. And anyone who says children don't need anything can get their gnads cut off. By [i]Jack Booted Thugs[/b] of course. OR, we can have a flat 5%*of the total budge devoted to military and military R&D BUT all nations of the earth have to surrender to the US and accept our leadership. You get to keep a) your language b) your religion c) you entertainment. And you get everything else we have to offer. Including the ability to run for president, vote, ramble on about anything you like and carry a gun (so you can defend yourself from the guy you offended when you were running your mouth). What?

And, granted they could be a higher chance of them possessing a high, across the board, technology base and compatable thinking (say 95%* chance of them kicking our arse due to technology *number pulled out of arse.) and is anyone advocating that we do nothing? Along the lines of 'Well, if they can get here, they win, so we might as well do nothing.'??? And there are probably billions of probably ways for aliens to get here. And there is absolutly NO evidence that they'll get here with high technology. Simply because we can't even guess the number of ways somethign ALIEN would work. You're still stuck with a humanocentristic notion when you keep harping on technology since that's the way humans do things. Now, if humas left the earth (say the Atlantans) and returned to reestablish themselves as dominant, then sure, I'd go with technology. But, for every tool using critter in the multiverse, there could be 1, 10, 1 billion or even 0 non-tool using critter. It's simply information we don't posses. So, being sensible, we know nothing. As such, stating in a factual manner that aliens will defeat us through technology is akin to saying my god is better than yours. Sure, it may be true but, we won't know until we get some further information...or, in the case of alien invaders, until it happens. Assuming that alien visitors many say visit are a hoax. Which ties into knowing details. Predictive thinking is based on knowledge. All we'd posses is that of what humans are capable of doing. If I can observe you for a short period of time, I can predict you behavior with some degree of accuracy. Just a knack for predictive psychology. Study your hand writting and determine what personality traits you have and thus what likely choices you'll make in given circumstances. One of the ironic things is the Viet Nam tangents and allusions that we recieve. That, for many a lower tech indiginious group can defeat a higher tech one. Somehow, that can ALWAYS apply to some western power (aka the US) but, it can't apply to them aliens. Where's my Custer? Where's my Zulu battles? Where's my Viet Nam? I've tried steering this tangent back on to the initial thread topic several times since it contributes little other than to say that the closed minded XXXXX such as myself live out of the box more than a liberal, open minded person would. But, I'm about 100% positive that when fracas said we needed our military to defend us from alien invaders, he was being flippant. Sarcasm doesn't always translate well on the net but come on, that was pretty off the wall comment to a supposedly serious thread about US militarism. Unless my thoughts are correct and this really isn't a serious thread...seeing as it opens with flame bait and has people closing down to discourse.

I've not seen the figures for its percentage of government spending, or at least can't remember them, but in comparison to other countries I know its very high. I think Iraq has shown us that a lot of this money seems to be being wasted as the US army is neither particularly big and despite all this money still encounters a mass of problems with its training. Given that we are not including aliens in our list of threats now, probably the largest section of military budget (research of new weapons and equipment) should probably be scaled back and the money better spent on recruiting superior soldiers and training them better for the situations they are going to most likely encounter. Personally I think a lot of the military budget would be better spent socially but thats just me, however I also think that a combined military R&D budget for the US and its allies would be better though you are going to run into issues here. One thing though - how much does military R&D make from new patents? Apparently NASA makes quite a lot from discoveries made in the space race adapted to everyday use, is the mililtary the same? As for aliens - there arn't millions of ways to get here, there are very few which is what seems to be the problem. If some tool using species elsewhere has managed to find another waym then its a good bet that they have more technology due to a better understanding of the universe. Seeing as we know vaguely what the universe is typically like I don't think we have really missed much on the way up. There isn't enough wierd gaps or unexplained phenonom in everyday life. Still either the aliens got here through advanced tech, or they have access to powers and things we haven't even conceived of yet. And they are in space and are a militaristic race (lets ignore the pacifists who don't attack or completely screw it up as its their first go) so are in a good position with superior assets.

I've seen a Dark Elf battle vs Marines back in 3rd ed fantasy/RTT (1st ed 40k) where the primitive elves kicked the space marines butts. That was when the rules were more compatable too...magic pwned. And I really think there could be as many ways to get across transgalactic / trans dimensional distances as there are alien races. They could litterlally be walking her right now. Yes, walking. Might be hard to imagine walking across several hundred light years of distance on foot but, all it takes is putting one foot in front of the other...and they started walking several zillion years ago, so they should be here soon. There's no good reason to expect that aliens would kick our butts when they arrive. Unless you think of them as human-like or similar. Geeze you lefty guys are so narrow minded and closed in your thought processes. Maybe that why you lose all the time. You can only convince the young of the rightness of your ways. Oh, and my interrogation of that alien grey is complet. I don't think the worm survived in my head that long. So, I decided to eat anything that remotly looked like a psychi organ. Pretty disgusting and no results. BUT, I think I can survive competing on Fear Factor, so, I'll chalk it up to funding. I'm also thinking on encaseing some of the aliens remains in glass and selling them on eBay as paperweights...extra fund raising. I was advised to sell them to the government but, seriously, they are broke and couldn't afford what I'm asking. Besides, I've seen al; the humanocentristic movies where the government screws over the little man. I may work for The MAN but, I'm not stupid (contrary to what many may think). Cause I'm board, You really don't know how many ways there are of getting here. Just because humans are planet bound with limited exceptions doesn't imply all ofthers are. And there are untold stars in the universe plus the potential for alternate dimensions and other make believe stuff. Assumptions that are reasonable but, still centers on tool usage. Still no guarantee that, IF there are aliens that they rely upon tool usage. And our understanding is limited by what we know, Human knowledge has greatly increased in the past 100yrs. While some things like psychic potential is pretty much dismissed in humans for example, it's still an idea that for all we know (next to nothing) is somethign that could be embodied in extrraterrestials. A very reasonable conclusion yet still doesn't mean humans are powerless to their 'powers' that we don't understand. Primitive cultures didn't understand gun powder weapons by technologically advanced cultures that we invading yet, they were still able to defend themselves somewhat. In he human example, technological might often won out in the inevitable end. but, we don't know how an alien invada would respond to resistance from 'primitives'. Another assumption on them having superior assets. A common thought could be the human notion of logistics. Combining ideas, it could easily be that they just don't have the resources as they thought to prosecute the war as they initially thought. So, they come here with superior abilities that are limited in quantity. Turtledove and other sci-fi novelist have pondered this in depth. For example, those aliens walking here across the galaxy only have the numbers and items they transport themselves. And, while they don't need to eat or breath or even age (they're sleepwalking ) they don't have enough to totally conqueor earth. Maybe if they got here 1,000 years sooner... Still assumptions. Sure, bad descisions would be nice but, they're ALIENS. For all we know, in the realm of human understanding, their rational discisions are, to humans, bad ones. Thus, as I've said several times, while they very well might be able to kick our butts, they might get their butts kicked by us. We know no variables. It's all make believe. Yet, if true, what are you going to do? I'd rather have a pokey stick than nothing even if a pokey stick still results in my defeat. Why? Because it brings me comfort. And that's what humans do quite often. Something that brings them comfort. And with that thought, I propose a 50% increase in military spending. This message brought to you by the good folks at the Military Industrial Complex Inc. Employing your daddy since the dawn of the nation. And from Nukes(tm). Because having them has solved every problem known to Man. Who needs the truth when you have a good logo? * Side note, I'm playing a SFB type game of glactic exploration and war and reading fan fiction by other players...why is it that when an alien race is contacted (and that alien race is locked in their own solar system due to a lack of knowledge of how to travel the intergalactic distances) that alien race often has fixed orbital defenses? Talk about a waste of money. Developing defenses for your planet from 'nothing that you've ever encountered or have any reasonable expectation of encountering'. I think it's chalked up to player knowledge over character knowledge. The player knows he'll encounter a hostile alien race even if the race (his character) doesn't. At least it makes for interesting battles. Beats, aliens show up, see no defenses and annihilates planet with anti-matter bombardment. War won. *yawn* Pie indeed. And what is cheese cake? Is it a pie of a cake or something else? Cheese cake, because stacking the odds in your favor, being a munchkin and general rules lawyer earns you a cry of cheese.
