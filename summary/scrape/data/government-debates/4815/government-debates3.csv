"04-18-2005","4815",3,"StrategosFF","None","Sorry I took that the wrong way, but regardless, the kind of thinking that leads to wars and seeing who has the largest most powerful military is precisely what I'd like to get away from in order to advance the military. Yes we learn from war, but its wasteful, I'm proposing a not so wasteful military.","fracas","108851","not really. i see wars as necessary at certain points in human history. i see no more intrinsic evils in war than the intrinsic evil of peace by oppression. a time and place for everything. it is a tool with consequences to achieve a goal (that may be adversedly affected by the same consequences). when to wage war needs to be considered rather than banning wars, or encouraging wars. kinda like the ultimate gun control debate i guess. btw, don't be so quick to dismiss what Zardoz has to say. sometimes madmen speaks the truth loudest. and there are nuggets of wisdom within. besides, he is in with the MAN, and it is wise to stay on the up and up with the MAN.","us-militariast","05:00 PM","government-debates","31"
"04-18-2005","4815",3,"StrategosFF","None","More than likely if they can figure out how to accelerate a large object FTL, then doing so to smaller objects should present no real difficulty, and the amount of kinetic energy that a simple piece of metal accelerated to near light speed can generate is quite devastating.","gnojek","108859","It would be so devastating that it could demolish things in the past!!!","us-militariast","05:11 PM","government-debates","32"
"04-19-2005","4815",3,"None","None","None","Tastyfish","109011","Yes, but if we are being sensible of the millions of probable ways the aliens get here, chances are it will be through technology and that it will be better than ours (because we can't do it). You have to use examples of what you have in these things - saying 'yeah but they might be really alien' is the same as dismissing everything because it could just be a mind reading jellyfish that likes cows and needs you to imagine a world where they could exist. In the everyday world we live in, those possibilities are meaningless - if aliens get here, they would in almost all certainty be in a better position to fight a war and be more advanced technologically. It may suprise you Zardoz, that recent breakthroughs have enabled people to predict events that might happen in the future even though they have not actually happened yet! A vast amount of these predictions, based off the current situation and things that have gone before are even right!","us-militariast","01:02 AM","government-debates","34"

And, granted they could be a higher chance of them possessing a high, across the board, technology base and compatable thinking (say 95%* chance of them kicking our arse due to technology *number pulled out of arse.) and is anyone advocating that we do nothing? Along the lines of 'Well, if they can get here, they win, so we might as well do nothing.'??? And there are probably billions of probably ways for aliens to get here. And there is absolutly NO evidence that they'll get here with high technology. Simply because we can't even guess the number of ways somethign ALIEN would work. You're still stuck with a humanocentristic notion when you keep harping on technology since that's the way humans do things. Now, if humas left the earth (say the Atlantans) and returned to reestablish themselves as dominant, then sure, I'd go with technology. But, for every tool using critter in the multiverse, there could be 1, 10, 1 billion or even 0 non-tool using critter. It's simply information we don't posses. So, being sensible, we know nothing. As such, stating in a factual manner that aliens will defeat us through technology is akin to saying my god is better than yours. Sure, it may be true but, we won't know until we get some further information...or, in the case of alien invaders, until it happens. Assuming that alien visitors many say visit are a hoax. Which ties into knowing details. Predictive thinking is based on knowledge. All we'd posses is that of what humans are capable of doing. If I can observe you for a short period of time, I can predict you behavior with some degree of accuracy. Just a knack for predictive psychology. Study your hand writting and determine what personality traits you have and thus what likely choices you'll make in given circumstances. One of the ironic things is the Viet Nam tangents and allusions that we recieve. That, for many a lower tech indiginious group can defeat a higher tech one. Somehow, that can ALWAYS apply to some western power (aka the US) but, it can't apply to them aliens. Where's my Custer? Where's my Zulu battles? Where's my Viet Nam? I've tried steering this tangent back on to the initial thread topic several times since it contributes little other than to say that the closed minded XXXXX such as myself live out of the box more than a liberal, open minded person would. But, I'm about 100% positive that when fracas said we needed our military to defend us from alien invaders, he was being flippant. Sarcasm doesn't always translate well on the net but come on, that was pretty off the wall comment to a supposedly serious thread about US militarism. Unless my thoughts are correct and this really isn't a serious thread...seeing as it opens with flame bait and has people closing down to discourse. So Tastyfish, what do you think about the US military budget?","us-militariast","08:39 AM","government-debates","35"

"04-19-2005","4815",3,"None","None","None","Tastyfish","109117","Not a lot, I certainly don't think that as a precautionary measure against possibly amish alien invaders its really up to it - though it would make area 51 interesting. I've not seen the figures for its percentage of government spending, or at least can't remember them, but in comparison to other countries I know its very high. I think Iraq has shown us that a lot of this money seems to be being wasted as the US army is neither particularly big and despite all this money still encounters a mass of problems with its training. Given that we are not including aliens in our list of threats now, probably the largest section of military budget (research of new weapons and equipment) should probably be scaled back and the money better spent on recruiting superior soldiers and training them better for the situations they are going to most likely encounter. Personally I think a lot of the military budget would be better spent socially but thats just me, however I also think that a combined military R&D budget for the US and its allies would be better though you are going to run into issues here. One thing though - how much does military R&D make from new patents? Apparently NASA makes quite a lot from discoveries made in the space race adapted to everyday use, is the mililtary the same? As for aliens - there arn't millions of ways to get here, there are very few which is what seems to be the problem. If some tool using species elsewhere has managed to find another waym then its a good bet that they have more technology due to a better understanding of the universe. Seeing as we know vaguely what the universe is typically like I don't think we have really missed much on the way up. There isn't enough wierd gaps or unexplained phenonom in everyday life. Still either the aliens got here through advanced tech, or they have access to powers and things we haven't even conceived of yet. And they are in space and are a militaristic race (lets ignore the pacifists who don't attack or completely screw it up as its their first go) so are in a good position with superior assets. We would have to rely on them making some bad discions if we wanted to win or focus more on more pure research than military to start to get the weapons needed. With current military technology it would not be enough.","us-militariast","09:35 AM","government-debates","37"
