"04-20-2005","4815",4,"Tastyfish","None","Course if I turn up with High Elves against his Black Templars... As for aliens - there arn't millions of ways to get here, there are very few which is what seems to be the problem. If some tool using species elsewhere has managed to find another waym then its a good bet that they have more technology due to a better understanding of the universe. Seeing as we know vaguely what the universe is typically like I don't think we have really missed much on the way up. There isn't enough wierd gaps or unexplained phenonom in everyday life. Still either the aliens got here through advanced tech, or they have access to powers and things we haven't even conceived of yet. And they are in space and are a militaristic race (lets ignore the pacifists who don't attack or completely screw it up as its their first go) so are in a good position with superior assets. We would have to rely on them making some bad discions if we wanted to win or focus more on more pure research than military to start to get the weapons needed. With current military technology it would not be enough.","Zardoz","109656","What edition are we playing? I've seen a Dark Elf battle vs Marines back in 3rd ed fantasy/RTT (1st ed 40k) where the primitive elves kicked the space marines butts. That was when the rules were more compatable too...magic pwned. And I really think there could be as many ways to get across transgalactic / trans dimensional distances as there are alien races. They could litterlally be walking her right now. Yes, walking. Might be hard to imagine walking across several hundred light years of distance on foot but, all it takes is putting one foot in front of the other...and they started walking several zillion years ago, so they should be here soon. There's no good reason to expect that aliens would kick our butts when they arrive. Unless you think of them as human-like or similar. Geeze you lefty guys are so narrow minded and closed in your thought processes. Maybe that why you lose all the time. You can only convince the young of the rightness of your ways. Oh, and my interrogation of that alien grey is complet. I don't think the worm survived in my head that long. So, I decided to eat anything that remotly looked like a psychi organ. Pretty disgusting and no results. BUT, I think I can survive competing on Fear Factor, so, I'll chalk it up to funding. I'm also thinking on encaseing some of the aliens remains in glass and selling them on eBay as paperweights...extra fund raising. I was advised to sell them to the government but, seriously, they are broke and couldn't afford what I'm asking. Besides, I've seen al; the humanocentristic movies where the government screws over the little man. I may work for The MAN but, I'm not stupid (contrary to what many may think). Cause I'm board, You really don't know how many ways there are of getting here. Just because humans are planet bound with limited exceptions doesn't imply all ofthers are. And there are untold stars in the universe plus the potential for alternate dimensions and other make believe stuff. Assumptions that are reasonable but, still centers on tool usage. Still no guarantee that, IF there are aliens that they rely upon tool usage. And our understanding is limited by what we know, Human knowledge has greatly increased in the past 100yrs. While some things like psychic potential is pretty much dismissed in humans for example, it's still an idea that for all we know (next to nothing) is somethign that could be embodied in extrraterrestials. A very reasonable conclusion yet still doesn't mean humans are powerless to their 'powers' that we don't understand. Primitive cultures didn't understand gun powder weapons by technologically advanced cultures that we invading yet, they were still able to defend themselves somewhat. In he human example, technological might often won out in the inevitable end. but, we don't know how an alien invada would respond to resistance from 'primitives'. Another assumption on them having superior assets. A common thought could be the human notion of logistics. Combining ideas, it could easily be that they just don't have the resources as they thought to prosecute the war as they initially thought. So, they come here with superior abilities that are limited in quantity. Turtledove and other sci-fi novelist have pondered this in depth. For example, those aliens walking here across the galaxy only have the numbers and items they transport themselves. And, while they don't need to eat or breath or even age (they're sleepwalking ) they don't have enough to totally conqueor earth. Maybe if they got here 1,000 years sooner... Still assumptions. Sure, bad descisions would be nice but, they're ALIENS. For all we know, in the realm of human understanding, their rational discisions are, to humans, bad ones. Thus, as I've said several times, while they very well might be able to kick our butts, they might get their butts kicked by us. We know no variables. It's all make believe. Yet, if true, what are you going to do? I'd rather have a pokey stick than nothing even if a pokey stick still results in my defeat. Why? Because it brings me comfort. And that's what humans do quite often. Something that brings them comfort. And with that thought, I propose a 50% increase in military spending. This message brought to you by the good folks at the Military Industrial Complex Inc. Employing your daddy since the dawn of the nation. And from Nukes(tm). Because having them has solved every problem known to Man. Who needs the truth when you have a good logo? * Side note, I'm playing a SFB type game of glactic exploration and war and reading fan fiction by other players...why is it that when an alien race is contacted (and that alien race is locked in their own solar system due to a lack of knowledge of how to travel the intergalactic distances) that alien race often has fixed orbital defenses? Talk about a waste of money. Developing defenses for your planet from 'nothing that you've ever encountered or have any reasonable expectation of encountering'. I think it's chalked up to player knowledge over character knowledge. The player knows he'll encounter a hostile alien race even if the race (his character) doesn't. At least it makes for interesting battles. Beats, aliens show up, see no defenses and annihilates planet with anti-matter bombardment. War won. *yawn* Pie indeed. And what is cheese cake? Is it a pie of a cake or something else? Cheese cake, because stacking the odds in your favor, being a munchkin and general rules lawyer earns you a cry of cheese. Cheese cake, it's what's on the (game) table.","us-militariast","01:07 AM","government-debates","46"
