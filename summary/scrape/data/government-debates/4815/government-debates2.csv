"04-17-2005","4815",2,"fracas","None","i find it funny the mentality that technological superiority leads to military victory. what is missing is the will to engage in a drag down no holds bar fight. the vietnamese understood that. there was a quote from the war that i'll paraphrase ""you got to be cautious against an enemy shooting arrows at your helicopter gunships"" i say we continue on our militarialization as is. @SFF where did i say that you said we should just give up and kill ourselves?","StrategosFF","108212","Back at ya, I was merely making the point that I said nothing of giving up. Secondly, a culture that is so technologically superior to ours that they can manage to traverse the distance between star systems, while we haven't even been able to send manned vessels past the moon. Also add to that the hazards inherent in traveling in outer space like micro-asteriods, something we've yet to devise a method of dealing with. Any culture with the technology to do those two things alone will be so much more advance than us that we wouldn't be able to defeat them. Some kind of shielding that is able to resist our conventional weaponry, the ability to choose the range of engagment, or whether or not to allow us to engage them at all, and even if we could, there is still the shielding. There are instances of cultures that were so technologically advanced over the culture they're fighting that the technologically inferior culture stood no chance in our own history. The Hittites and the Egyptians for instance, the Hittities who simply had the advantage of metal weaponry were easily able to defeat the Egyptians.","us-militariast","01:23 PM","government-debates","16"

"04-17-2005","4815",2,"Zardoz","None","[b]Nope, no acceleration for FTL flight. They use fairy dust gathered from their planet or worm holes that require little actual acceleration. Once they're on our planet, they're fair game. Think outside the box. For every imaginative scenario you can concoct to say 'we lose no matter what', I can make one up that says 'we have a fighting chance'. You're still useing human thinking to dictate how an 'alien invader' would invade. Hollywood and many sci-fi books often are humanocentristic. Heck, half the games I play and books I read are. So, it's no real wonder why many would think 'we lose simply cause they are advanced.' And, while left-right (have I used the term right yet?) is extremely subjective and lible to change (you could be a jack booted thug on another subject), it's an easy sterotype that many seem to perpetuate. If I throw a bunch of stones that have liberal (left) attitudes on them, and most hit you accuratly, then you'd be more liberal than conservative. The point, that many seem to over look is their posting styles. This thread is full of flame bait (of which I perpetuate) and garners no real debate. It's merely an 'I am right and you're wrong' ******* contest. All things considered, it's a very American mud-slingging contest. Seems to happen with most debate forums. Someone makes a claim as fact. That fact doesn't jive with others. Any proofs brought in by either side is ignored with a wand of causual dismissal (tm) as incorrect and biased propaganda. Why should I think anything different of this site? Already, there have been several debates (arguements) on this and other topics where one side simply dismisses the other. And, seeing that these types of web sites are primarily for entertainment, I chose to entertain myself...and anyone else who get's pleasure from my crass behavior. Occasionally, I'll nod my head and agree with something that another states, like on the subject of gay rights, where I'm a lefty. Or anti-abortion issues where I'm a righty and current allies become enemies and visa versa but, stand back and actually look at your debate styles. Some say any figures presented are false and juggled to support a position. When dealing with what-if sistuations like mythical alien invaders, the aliens have to think like humans...makes it easier I guess to concoct scenarios. *sigh* off to work to surmize the news...bunch of garbage that it is I'm sure.","StrategosFF","108294","Regardless of different they may be from us, there is no reason a race that can traverse from solar system would choose to engage an enemy on their grounds under circumstances that would not favor their victory. Yes its possible, and likely that an alien culture will develop differently than humanity, but FTL can not be the sole driving aim of any species that became dominate enough on a planet to have the resources at hand to create FTl vessels. So I am saying that if we are attacked by an alien species, we will not win, we may not lose, but we have no chance of victory, as we will be unable to strike at them, and they can choose to engage us at their leisure. I don't care how different your aliens may be, but no dominate species will choose to lose, otherwise they wouldn't have survived to become dominate, they may not think like us but that doesn't make them stupid. Back to my original post, we have yet to create a system that can reliably stop an object traveling at whatever speeds it is IBCMs travel at, so we need to advance our military, not enlarge it. A bigger military means more money being spent on trying to stay ""up-to-date"" which means that it will take longer for upgrades to reach the troops. If we are truly concerned about an alien invasion, than we should be reducing the size of the military not seeking to enlarge it and use it to achieve our expansionist goals.","us-militariast","05:31 PM","government-debates","19"

Bow and arrows vs British early machine guns? Not exactly fair. I wouldn't say ""no holds bar fight."" What is missing is the motivation to fight. Not to mention training. You may have the best weapons, but if your training is like the Iraqi National Guard, well, you're going to suck even with good equipment. Motivation is specifically a reaosn why we shouldn't be using mercenaries. Mercenaries are paid to fight. Once that level of danger outrises the marginally utility of their payments, they are useless. I disagree. I say we become more efficent. It takes tens if not hundreds of people to allow one soldier to fight. Let's cut that number way down.","us-militariast","08:22 PM","government-debates","20"

Waging war is not the only way to increase the efficiency of a military, in fact given the set up of the government and the military, it would only become more inefficient.

"04-18-2005","4815",2,"Zardoz","None","Actually, it's 19% and we spend more on entitlement programs...welfare. Nearly 50% of our budget is on SS and the like. And IIRC, 25% is spent of SS. But, knowing you, you probably use figures from some anti-military site. But, in general NO, you're pandering to a myth that the M1l1+ary is the LARGEST segment we spend our money on. Thanks though, just need another lefty pushing a lie. TROLL[/i]","Comrade Brian","108481","I got this information from a national news magazine, and SS was only 20% Oh yes, a few weeks ago Bush cut social program funding, and raised military funding, as part of his program cuts for more money so we could probably take out Iran.","us-militariast","02:42 AM","government-debates","24"

In my scenario they are. Not only that, they opened their worm hole and stepped out in Amish country or 'the sticks' Africa. Saw some apparently 'primitive' people and decided to open the worm hole larger to move in. Turns out, their initial apprasals were wrong and the cunnin humans (lead by America of course) not only pull a Viet Nam victory (irony here) and defeat the aliens and then counter invade useing stolen worm hole technology. And, it doesn't take a lot of high technology to open a worm hole, just alternate technology...something we'd have discovered had we not decided to abort some super genius...but, we had to since his twin was that Histler dude that Nostrodamus talked about. This is a dumb (for humans) tangent. You could create a scenario about aliens impervius to radiation and blast...but very succeptable to potatoes. So, we'd best invest in potatoe guns. Just to be sure. FTL travel could simply be something humans haven't thought of yet other alien races have had since they could smelt copper. Seriously, most aliens don't even wear clothing if you've noticed (thinking the Greys who steal hillbillies), they can't be that advanced. The only thing an enlarged military seems to do is allow america to play world police and employ a bunch of people. Some good and some bad out of that. I personally could see trimming the military budget down. Even a 5% cut which is (according to what I find) 1% overall budget. Spend that money on reducing the deficit or education and infrastructure. I have no problems playing world police. Some do though. It could be our choice of targets are suspect. Would anyone complain if we went to the Sudan? As to enhancing our capabilities through R&D, we still get lambasted for that. Design better, more effecient nukes...get yelled at for thinking on actually useing these weapons that many think will destroy the world...even a .5 kt bunker buster that detonates below ground (kind of like how nuke tests currently are conducted). Work on Star Wars, and get complaints how that money is wasted since a) the USSR is defunct b) it only provokes China (just like it was supposed to provoke the USSR when it was initially proposed) c) is money better spent on social programs. d) is circumnavigated by terrorist with back pack nukes or smuggled weapons. Work on a new generation of combat vehicle and get some bitching about how the new device is not needed because a) what aready exist is good enough and STILL better than what we're facing b) a waste since it'll never be used in this day and age of relative peace c) is money better spent on social programs. Work on an offensive system and it either a) pollutes the environment and is an unclean weapon b) isn't needed for a number of reasons or c) is money better spent on social programs. Bottom line is you can't please everyone ever. So, if you want to get something done, ask for compromises. I'm willing to start with a 1% cut in the Military budget increasing to 5% over the next 5 years.
