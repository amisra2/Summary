I don't see any major power in the world other than the US taking an aggressive military stance. We could reduce our military strength by 50% and still retain the capability of supreme defense based solely on nuclear warfare. Economics are the contemporary war, one that we're badly losing partially due to our out-of-proportion to tax base military commitment. I realize reducing US military capability would crash our economy, which brings up the question of now or later. Which is also the reason we continue our aggression as it feeds the GDP, that political gauge used to sooth the public and retain their confidence. Again; losing the economic war is a question of now or later. What surprises me is the lack of understanding by America's youth of their economic future being constructed as a house of cards consisting of public debt and trade deficits. If I were facing that, I'd be organizing political offense in no uncertain terms. Lack of personal responsibility seems to be the primary cause of that apathy. As to other whatever in the galaxy trouncing us, I agree with the other poster in that if they can get here and are aggressive, their technology makes any military resistance on our part pretty much a bad movie.","us-militariast","06:53 PM","government-debates","9"

Did I say we should just give up and kill ourselves now? I said nothing of giving up. I'm saying at present we would be destroyed by any culture advanced enough to cross the distance from the next closes star system to ours. Yes we should continue to ADVANCE our military technology, but spending money to equip a military the current size of the US is actually slowing that process down, because its become too expensive to equip our military to the BEST of our ability.","us-militariast","07:00 PM","government-debates","10"

Nearly 50% of our budget is on SS and the like. And IIRC, 25% is spent of SS. But, knowing you, you probably use figures from some anti-military site. But, in general NO, you're pandering to a myth that the M1l1+ary is the LARGEST segment we spend our money on. Thanks though, just need another lefty pushing a lie. TROLL And what makes you think they wouldn't be pacifistic cattle with some gimp technology advantage that gave them the ability to stumble upon us and allow humanity to dominate the universe with the technology we rape from them??? Haven't you heard the lefty idea that any high tech civilization is also pacifistic? Besides, it's entirely plausible that a low tech society could know the secret to FTL capabilities. Yep, poor little alien invaders, useing blackpowder weaponry (the best in the universe) and Metal buckets that can warp to another planet in the blink of the eye. Seriously, all alien invaders would be anti-military commies. They have to be otherwise they'd turn their weapons upon themselves long before reaching the stars. They're wanting to stay on our planet cause their sun is going nova. They're pretty pushy and rude too. (all aliens are...especially them commie ones). So, as far as I'm concerned, they're invaders. If we don't have the best weaponry we can develope, we'll get plowed over. And, assuming they do have advanced tech, I'd rather burn our own planet than let them take it from us. And, with that mentality, I don't think we have enough nukes yet...or what ever super weapon comes after that. Oh, and my dick is bigger than yours and I'm smarter too. Seriously, what's the point of threads like these? Not really anything more than flame bait built upon distortions or out right lies. This message brought to you by Jack Booted Thugs.

[/i]","georged","108133","You seem to have some serious challenges with mathematics and understanding federal budget composition. 1. With interest costs from prior military deficits, homeland security and DoE nuclear allocations, veteran benefits, Afghanistan and Iraq, military costs are closer to 45% of budget. Unless, of course, you prefer using current, direct military costs only excluding debt, allocations, Afghanistan and Iraq for public consumption as do politicians of both parties. 2. SS is not and has never been included in any federal budget. SS administration is a budget line item, but is a minor cost, has nothing to do with SS tax revenue or benefits and is included in human resources. You seem to gather your figures and opinions from some mythical site, and your labeling.","us-militariast","09:04 AM","government-debates","13"

Besides which how would be able to attack a species that can move at such speeds in outer space where we only have one form of vessels capable of navigating about. Maybe you should stop labeling things as being left or right and simply look at the point someone is trying to make, but that is apparently beyond you.","us-militariast","01:10 PM","government-debates","15"
