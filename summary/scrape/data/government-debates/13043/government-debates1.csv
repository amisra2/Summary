I'm not exactly sure where I'm going with this, but I'd mainly like to get people's take on what WE should be required to do/not do/contribute to society and what we should expect to get back....","responsibility-entitlement-free-society","10:50 AM","government-debates","1"

We also have certain liabilities: To maintain a certain level of order. To maintain a certain level of awareness of the rights and needs of others in the group. To maintain and sustain the welfare of the group by lending, when necessary, aid to other members who need it, just as all individuals have, in their turn, been rendered aid by the collective action of the group, (laws, regulations, common conveniences such as roads, schools, hospitals at one time, other things shared in common and paid for by the group). To contribute a certain amount of time, wealth and other assets to the maintenance of the group. And a whole bunch of other stuff.","responsibility-entitlement-free-society","01:37 PM","government-debates","2"

I think the rest of us should pull our weight. I think we all deserve equal access to education, safety and health care for without those three things all the hard work in the world won't get you far. The wealthy are not all evil - but there are those who use their money and power to advance their own greed and do so regardless of those they may hurt - and these people should be stopped. There are those who abuse the welfare and other support systems and they should be stopped. But we also need to stop demonizing the poor. They are hordes of working poor. If an adult is giving 40+ hours to a job he/she should be able to live off it. Maybe not mansions, cars and 50"" TVs. But a place to sleep, food to eat, heat in the winter. People should not have to work full time or more and still be hungry. We should all be responsible for protecting each other's rights. Even if we may not agree with them. And we should all be responsible for not hurting each other.","responsibility-entitlement-free-society","01:07 PM","government-debates","5"

"10-17-2009","13043",1,"None","None","None","mata","374566","I live in the USA. My observations of the status quo: Socialism for the wealthy & crony capitalism for the poor. Corporations & blocs of industry pull the strings of a puppet regime where they privatize profits & socialize losses, yknow like as in corporate welfare? This, in turn, leads to a kind of oligarchy or quasi religious hegemony, voila status quo America. Factor in some quasi religious fanaticism with individuals hiding behind (conscienceless) corporate organization & structure & you get hate & envy acted out under the guise of moral indignation & virtue. Not quite sure this is what we had in mind when we fought our War of Independence.","responsibility-entitlement-free-society","05:10 PM","government-debates","9"
"10-19-2009","13043",1,"None","None","None","mata","374738","When I wrote ""you get hate & envy acted out under the guise of moral indignation & virtue"" I wasn't thinking about the thread entitled ""The rich are NOT superior!"". I was thinking more about the thread entitled, ""Extremism, hate speech & moral equivalency."" Be that as it may. I agree it's wonderful that there are wealthy people that do good things for those less fortunate through charitable organizations & the like. However, when you wrote, ""We strut around like Joan of Arc. We're all heros in our own minds, out to slay the dragon of the ""evil rich"" all the while holding our hands out to catch the droppings of gold,"" I immediately thought of the belief system/economic theory known as voodoo, trickledown, supply-side, etc. That is the underlying belief of the voodoo system, that is, give more to the rich so they can trickle down the droppings of gold to everyone else. I don't hate or envy the rich. But I also do not believe they are supporting everyone else. If that were the case ... Rather I think more along the lines that they are people just like anyone else, some inclined to be this way or that, they haven't escaped human nature. However, I do think it's problematic when you have a system that relies upon the charity of those who control most of the resources. It seems similar to a plantation based economy or something like the feudal system.","responsibility-entitlement-free-society","07:20 AM","government-debates","11"

"10-21-2009","13043",1,"None","None","None","mata","375121","I think the USA is best described as a mixed economy. There are facets of both capitalism & socialism (& more) in the present inter-related systems. The entanglement of politics, economics & religion continues to vex. There are some who seem to believe the theory of the free market is something akin to a civic religion. I don't believe there is any one system or sub-system that will act as ""savior."" It's sort of disturbing to me when I hear the mantras or to hear ""believers"" in various economic theories sometimes referred to as ""faithful disciples."" bbbrrr I think these sort of faith-based belief systems, which look to one system as ""savior,"" sometimes lead to a way of thinking similar to a plantation or serfdom mentality. When these types of systems were the status quo, very few people could imagine a better way of doing things, & of course, things could always be worse. When THAT is the mind-set, it may become a self-fulfilling prophecy & things remain that way, i.e., the status quo. ""The status quo bias is a cognitive bias for the status quo; in other words, people tend not to change an established behavior unless the incentive to change is compelling."" (unsure of source? wikipedia?) I think it takes courage to imagine a potentially better, albeit different way of doing things. I also think it's necessary to use a different level of thinking to solve or resolve problems rather than usung the one that got us into the problem in the first place.","responsibility-entitlement-free-society","07:25 AM","government-debates","14"

We are entitled to nothing other than fair treatment and should be subject to none other than ourselves. Don't tread on me. I don't tread on you. I provide for myself and do not need to provide for you or yours unless I wish to do so. Meaning taxes are unfairly and disproportionately collected through property taxes assessed for (a) public schools, (b) hospitals, (c) universities/colleges. Unfairly assessed through basic needed utilities bills. Through vehicle registrations and inspections and then via tolls for same. Through over sized fines and levies upon violations defined within individual cities, towns and counties/parishes and states. Those fines astronomical now due to gov't being too large and unaccountable to their overspending and indiscriminate spending habits.","responsibility-entitlement-free-society","03:25 AM","government-debates","15"
