But the United States is still more productive than any of those nations... combined. Canada doesn't fit right, I know. I was hoping you wouldn't use Canada... I wouldn't say that's true at all. Individuals account for the majority of political money... companies only give away a few hundred thousand a year. Of course a lot of government officials have ties to companies... executive experience in a company is a great thing to have when attempting to gain an elected office. According to what list? And I wouldn't say Mexico being ahead would be a surprise... Mexico is primarily an agricultural economy. Canada is too lightly populated in comparison to land area to ever score high on one of those lists.","long-list-u-n-failures","10:00 PM","government-debates","46"
"02-01-2004","396",4,"None","None","None","Draconis","33357","You have proven my two points. For what ever reason, other places have better schools, and are less violent. The list is one I can't remember so I'll give you that and we'll say your right. For the murder rate by the way, what is the percent? In any case... the point we have been straying from is that while america is marginally better at some areas, and other countries marginally better then america, their is nothing so radically diffrent to create such idol worship of the american flag, goverment and country. We have established (as two of my points you have proven wrong, and two proven right) america is about even with other areas of the world, as well other areas of the world have virtually the exact same legal conditions, similiar if not better people, and per captia about the same industrilization. So why are you willing to fight wars and murder people you don't know to defend a country that is simply defined by lines on a map? Besides, as I have been trying to say before we got distracted, people who preach patriotism will kill mankind. The people looking out for the best interests of their countries instead of the best interests of the human race will lead to our downfall. Patriotism is a major cause of war. Come on, you think people in Iraq don't think just like you, thinking their country is being invaded, and doing as you would, whatever it takes. My main issue is that we are taught from birth to honor our country, live their and worship its flag, for no other reason then the fact our parents let us be born in said country. To honor ones country is pointless, to love ones country is stupid, this is going to catch flack, but seriously, when we really think about it, the goverment needs us to be patriotic, they need red-blooded americans fighting in Iraqi hell-holes all day to keep the oil flowing, for no better reason then ""defend they country"". Funny how many people you can get into the patriotic catogry when you say their way of life is being threaten, when all they have to do to aviod that threat is move east or north (hell, over half of all immigration to canada comes from the states). If we weren't patriotic the whole system would fall apart, our countries would fail. I am surprised no one has ever thought about it before (and if they have, I wish I would have heard about it), but patriotism is not good, in fact it is degenerate to the evolution of mankind. Hell, nuclear winter? Bio-chemical threats? How many supporters do you think these rouge factions would have if people weren't patriotic, didn't think saudi arabi is truly going to be destroyed? P.S. Productive in what? Intellegence? Beaten by britian, Exports? Beaten by China? (All actual countries, peoples, places and events are dramitizations to prove my point, and their factuality is now stated as false, though they may coloborate to actual events, they are other debates not important to this one and therefore we shall say are examples and not true)","long-list-u-n-failures","01:43 AM","government-debates","47"
"02-01-2004","396",4,"None","None","None","Broker","33382","Worker productivity and per capita GDP is highest in the US. It is the most economically powerful, most productive, most powerful country to ever exist on the planet. Norway is $3,000 different, Canada $7,000 different. Germany and France are $10,000 away... We aren't beaten in exports by anyone, either. The US is the biggest exporter in the world by $80 billion. The next highest would be Germany, followed by Japan. We have a lot to be proud of here. The United States invented the modern world...","long-list-u-n-failures","08:52 AM","government-debates","48"
"02-01-2004","396",4,"None","None","None","Draconis","33394","Basically your arguement is not that patriotism is good, but simply that the U.S. is the best economic place in the world? Fine, you can have that. Now please, go back and read my post, the fact the U.S. is so powerful economically has a little bit to do with my arguement. Sure the U.S. is all powerful, but wait, as we have estabalished, its not. Only the economy is better, which, as I have been trying to say, is a small peice of the pie. And if you are not willing to accept the fact that the U.S. isn't that increadiably diffrent from every other area of the world, try living in another western country for a few years, you'll be amazed how simliar they are. I have, and trust me, going from new york to toronto feels like you just went next door and are still in new york. besides, you don't defend patriotism, you don't even defend democracy, you defend your version of democracy. Cheaper, more rich version, yes, but not best version. So I ask you the question agian, why do you love your country?","long-list-u-n-failures","12:02 PM","government-debates","49"
"02-01-2004","396",4,"None","None","None","Broker","33458","The US has a lot more going for it than economic power that seperates it from other Western nations. Because it is the America. The world's greatest and most powerful nation-state... indeed, the greatest nation to ever grace the earth. A capitalist society where anyone can go from rags to riches. A place where you can start a business and succeed without your government jumping in your way.","long-list-u-n-failures","05:51 PM","government-debates","50"

A few hundred years ago that may have been true, but in britian, canada, france and germany the goverment's only morotorum is that critical servies can't be redicliously over-charged I.E. doctors cannot charge a thousands bucks for 1 hour","long-list-u-n-failures","06:07 PM","government-debates","51"
"02-01-2004","396",4,"None","None","None","Broker","33466","It's much more difficult to start a business in any of the countries you named. A study put out on this ranked the US in the top 5 easiest places to start a business. Tax burden, regulation, etc can make it difficult. Notice that the very successful businesses in those countries are almost always government owned.","long-list-u-n-failures","06:15 PM","government-debates","52"
"02-01-2004","396",4,"None","None","None","Draconis","33468","Top 5 you say? Doesn't sound like the U.S. is the ""best"" anymore. Besides without goverment regulation U.S. companies charge redcolous prices, one of the reasons you have been losing jobs in the east. ITS NOT THAT GREAT. Name one thing that I can't shoot down about the ""U.S."" being the best country in the world?","long-list-u-n-failures","06:18 PM","government-debates","53"
"02-01-2004","396",4,"None","None","None","Broker","33471","Territories took the top spots... they pretty much don't have taxes on businesses and make it easy to form them there. You know, like Bermuda. That's not true. We've been losing jobs so companies can charge lower prices by moving their production to China and India. People complain about the job losses but they sure love stores like Wal-Mart. Why are you saying US companies charge so much? That's just not true... The US has a much higher disposable income. It's easier to start a busines in the US. The US produces the most innovation. Edit: By the way, a report by a US government agency found that the US will have 10 million more jobs than people in 2010. We're probably not in any danger job wise.","long-list-u-n-failures","06:23 PM","government-debates","54"

You are so wrong it scares me, just what you think patriotism is. You think the love of your country because of its lands is patriotism, the love of its money, its people? But I thank you, for through you, I have reached a higher mental plateau, so thank you, your debating has not be pointless.

Of course, we all know that the entire population of the world is just awaiting their chance to emmigrate to the US, or to institute an american lifestyle. Seriously, for some reason, folks here in the good old US of S have a hard time understanding that not everybody in the world wants to be an American or live like an American. This is a result of pathetic brainwashing that is started in American schools early on. I can actually remember a teacher in grade school telling the class that America is the only place int he world where there is freedom of speech. There are actually HUGE numbers of folks in the US who honestly believe that we are freeer (if that is even a word) than the entire rest of the world. Of course, I am not free to drive down the road and talk on my cell phone I am not free to ride a motorcyle without a helmet I am not free to mow my lawn while drunk God knows I can't smoke pot (which I probably wouldn't do anyway, but it would be nice ot have the option). I am free to smoke if I so desire, but only if I am willing to pay massive federal taxes on each pack. One thing that you will find when it comes to Americans is that, as a rule, they don't do much international traveling, so they have little or no idea about what it is actually like in other countries. The US tourists I have encountered internationally were usually rude, arrogant, obnoxious, and basically acted like complete XXXXXX. They always seem to think that they will be adored, wherever they go, because they are AMERICANS. Broker, if you have a link to the data regarding disposable income, cost of living, and taxation, I would appreciate it if you would post it. My personal experiance has been that things generally cost less outside of the US, and jobs usually pay more. Income tax, (where applicable) are generally more aborad than in the US, but overall tax load is lower, due to the lack of sneak taxes that are imposed here. You can bake the numbers both ways and still call it a cookie. As far as the UN goes, we need the UN if we are going to meddle in the affairs of other countries. It lends legitimacy to our efforts. If we wish to stop meddling in the affairs of other countries, we do not need the UN. There has been what I concieve as an overwhelming opinion in the US for the last several years that we are so big, and so powerful, that nobody could touch us, nobody would dare even try. IF the recent terrorism has (or should have) tuaght us anything at all, it is that we CAN be touched, and some folks WILL dare. The UN gives us a place where we can address grievances with other countries, and they with us, in a controlled environment and within the view of the world community. The UN is also based on the thoery that before making decisions that will affect the entire world (such as invading other countries and causing big headaches for cartographers all over the world), the rest of the international community should be consulted. In general, I do not think that the UN tries to meddle in domestic affairs of memebr nations, nor should they. The UN was designed to aid in the implementation of international policymaking. Without the UN, we loose certain tools, such as trade sanctions, that have in the past proven valuable in resolution of conflicts without having to resort to military action. If we are going to judge the efeectiveness of an organisation based on their performance in kilitary conflicts, let's take a good, hard look at the last several wars the US has fought (and please don't give me a bunch of XXXX about the difference between ""wars"" and ""police actions""). Vietnam.....Lost Korea......Lost Afghanistan......Lost Iraq........????? don't know yet, it's not over. Now, in Afghanistan, we did manage to displace the Taliban, break up the Al-Queda units, and install a puppet government. Of course, the puppet government has turned out to be impotent, Warlords still rule the majority of the country, and there still seems to be plenty of resistance fighters running around. In the words of one Afghan guy ""I thought that when they declared that the war was over the fighting would stop"" (as quoted by Pravda). Not excactly a decisive victory. Even if we class Afghanistan as ""not over"", The war record of the US doesn't look that hot lately.","long-list-u-n-failures","06:14 AM","government-debates","58"
"02-28-2004","396",4,"None","None","None","Nallyo","36742","First of all, we did not lose Korea. We merely backed out of a situation that would have quickly led to World War 3. If China (another worthless UN country) had not decided to send all of its fricking army into North Korea, the war would have been over a lot sooner. The only problem was that they had more men than we had bullets. Vietnam, if you remember, was started by the French asking for our help. Then, when we were in the country, they decided to pull out and yell at us for our continued insistence at finishing the job. The only reason that we lost Vietnam was because the presidents bound the hands of the military because of protests back home. How can you expect to win a war when you cannot bomb training camps or the homeland of the enemy? By the way, has anyone cleared up that whole UN supported mess in Bosnia yet? My opinion: The UN is becoming the League of Nations of the 1920s-30s. Expect some serious confrontation to arise if we pull out and they are left governing the world.
