U.N. fails to condemn slavery in Sudan. The U.N. is even a joke in Sierra Leone. Where was the U.N. during the massacre in Rwanda in 1994? Where were they when Mugabe expunged all white farmers from Zimbabwe, and caused a famine that threatens to kill 8 million? Now they are talking with Mugabe about how to avert the disaster. What a joke! They impede or war in Iraq, claiming diplomacy and inspections are the only answer. At the same time, they refuse to discuss the North Korea's brazen moves. U.N. ignores more human rights abuses. This time in Iran. U.N. takes over in East Timor, and then drops the ball leading to further violence and anarchy. Remember those Buddist statues in Afghanistan that the Taliban destroyed? Well, you guessed it. The U.N. failed to save them. The U.N. fails to protect those displaced by a civil war in Angola. That's right. The U.N. failed in Kashmir, too. The U.N. failed in Somalia. The U.N. failed in Bosnia. The U.N. failed in Israel. The U.N. failed in Columbia. The U. N. failed in Iraq. Bottom line, the U.N. is a failure, and it is time to dissolve that money sucking waste of time and energy. Anyone who would defend such a utter failure is just as inept as that political body. It takes a certain kind. Somebody must either have a perverse view of human kindness, or a sick sense of humor, if they still place any credibility in the U.N..","long-list-u-n-failures","01:24 AM","government-debates","1"

The UN has no business being in Iraq unless we ask them to help us there. UN forces are going to start coming to Iraq to help out now but they are not going to have a whole lot of say about what happens there. I don't think the US is treating Iraq as a prize anyways. We are trying to install a democracy there at a great expense to us. There is nothing selfish about what has been happening since the war was declared over. I have no doubt that our troops want to leave there as soon as possible and that our leaders want to see Iraq become a successful country running independent of US control.","long-list-u-n-failures","11:12 AM","government-debates","8"

You are acting like it's a prize won because you basically said that since the UN didnt help us win, we cant share it. Its our prize not theres. If the US truly wanted Iraq to become an independent country ASAP, then they would gladly accept help from other nations to speed the process.","long-list-u-n-failures","01:23 AM","government-debates","10"

The US is XXXXXX at the UN for what they did. The UN is XXXXXX at the US for what it did. So although they can both agree on the future of Iraq and it would be helpful for both to work together, it will take time to iron out their previous differences. It's just a political game in my view so even if it doesn't make any sense logically, this is the way politics work. But I better add that the UN and US do have slightly different ideas on Iraq such as who should get the contracts for the country and what will be done for the past contracts with the country. Some UN nations were getting pretty rich off deals with Iraq and want their contracts to stand. I don't know what to expect with the UN now coming in and helping out in Iraq. The US still expects to keep most of the control there and will also have the most units there. I would guess that the instability will slowly tapper off but the UN alone isn't going to be the deciding factor. It has to be the people of Iraq that decide that they are ready to move forward. Maybe the UN can help them figure this out in a way that the conquering US couldn't.","long-list-u-n-failures","08:11 AM","government-debates","11"
