I wholeheartedly condemn prior US actions in South America and Southeast Asia (among others) that have been antithetical to US democratic and liberal ideals. It is interesting that you simultanously take a realist position in terms of US Foreign Policy, yet condemn its most prominent actions. US anti-democratic actions in Chile and Vietnam were realist measures taken to hedge against Soviet power. My philosophy isn't realist, its liberal. It just happens to argue that the realist concerns are addressable within the liberal framework, and that excessive realism that doesn't take into account democratization is doomed to failure (as well as morally bankrupt). In such a framework, US oppressive actions in nations such as Chile, Iran, Vietnam, etc would be condemned, not ratified. Our fiscal situation is a problem. It also is a problem that should be solved by repealing certain irresponsible tax cuts, not by abdicating our moral responsibilities around the world. It's a question of priorities, and tax cuts for the relatively affluent and privileged, at the expense of the most oppressed and marginalized peoples of the world, strikes me as a rather illiberal (and indeed ethically shocking) position to take. And as for my theory violating ""charity begins at home,"" well aside from the fact that there is no corralary to the axiom that says ""charity ENDS there too,"" I don't think that one can discount a whole theory on the basis that it conflicts with a proverb.","georged","75662","I'm not arguing with your theory based on any past history, defending or championing same. The past is just that, a history of our foreign policy objectives, right or wrong. I have an understanding of US policy, past and present, but as an observer who monitors them for financial purposes, not as critic or supporter. The tax cuts were simple vote-buying fiscal irresponsibility, seemingly what the public, next to patriotic slogans based on defending the US at any cost, finds desirable in political leaders, even if the benefits in both are very skewed and highly questionable. I'm still trying to fathom the invasion and occupation of Iraq. The only difference I'm able to determine between that and Vietnam is that there was no China to discourage complete occupation of Iraq. Regardless of moral responsibilities, there were and are other countries far more despotic and dangerous than Iraq under Saddam. I still see it as a refocus of the US public at unreasonable financial and moral costs, but as I'm not the persons defining reason, I'll continue to watch the dollar disintegrate as our supposedly 'moral' responsibilities are pursued. Our politically motivated irresponsible fiscal policies go far beyond ill-timed tax cuts.","interventionism-suicide-american-republic","01:30 PM","government-debates","16"
"11-07-2004","3346",2,"dsadevil","None","Finally, I'm aware that our fiscal problems extend beyond foolish tax cuts. The original analysis still stands, however. Insofar as we have to set priorities in terms of where we reduce spending, it seems unfair and deeply immoral to sacrifice the most oppressed and least powerful in order to provide for the relatively wealthy and better off in the global sphere. When weighing oppurtunity costs of spending cuts, we should view it through a prism that makes sure we don't further isolate the marginalized. It seems clear to me that we can restructure our domestic spending actions such that we could still fulfill our moral obligations without facing an economic collapse, especially since the ideal end-result of these FP choices would be to further liberalize the world, which gives the US more markets to trade in and would, longterm, boost economic growth than what we have in the status quo.","georged","76013","I'm still having problems reconciling our instant shift in policy with years of assisting Saddam in maintaining his hold over Iraq as a buffer against Iran and his containment of Iraqi based Kurds assisting our alliance with Turkey. While I'm aware that our political ego continues to suffer from the Shah, as repressive a leader who has ever walked the face of this earth, being deposed by the Iranian people, the Shah, like the Sauds, was openly 'our man' while Saddam was also 'our man' in a more subtle manner. For those reasons alone, I see the invasion and occupation of Iraq as a desperate public refocus by an administration mired in domestic economic difficulties (I'm not blaming this administration for that, a circumstance building for the past 25-years) and their inability to place their hands on Bin Laden, who had successfully attacked the US in the 9/11 event. The invasion of Iraq was rationalized and initiated solely on Iraq possessing WMDs that poised a physical danger to the US, without reference to any humanitarian purposes. The humanitarian issue was raised after no justification for the WMD rational evolved and subsequently used as the primary rational for being in Iraq (instilling democracy). With regard to the financial aspects of the invasion and occupation, it served two purposes, both deceptive, equally well. Not only was Iraq shifted to a humanitarian level in the eyes of the public, making public funding of the event less of a task (even though under Geneva Agreements as the aggressor we're required to rebuild their infrastructure and provide a working government, something not publicized), a war-time footing is a wonderful method to polish GDP numbers using public debt for purposes of placating the US public for pending elections, a population now dependent on a service level economy driven by internal transactions 85% composed of public debt and siege mentality consumer spending, not industrial exports. The increase in world oil prices alone, primarily due to our ME aggression, contributed more to our internal transactions than full, service-level employment could have accomplished. In summary, humanitarian issues regarding Iraq did not surface until US claims of Iraqi possession of WMDs that endangered the US were proven unfounded. On the financial side, US military spending, at the cost of domestic spending, has greatly increased due to Iraq and ongoing domestic fears instigated by our foreign policy of approving Israel's expansionist policies. All of that increased spending is based on US public debt, primarily absorbed by China and Japan. As side notes, I found it interesting that Asian nations, led by China and Japan, declined participation in US September treasury issue auctions. Public announcements were that the US debt ceiling, currently maxed out, was being held until after the election. Waiting for the fed to raise interest rates, also after the election, would be the practical explanation. A point would just about make up the difference in the dollar's current slide against world currencies, very important to those portfolio managers. And now we've decided to furnish the entire nation of Iraq with comprehensive health care, on our nickel using public debt, also announced after the election. Are we striving to be another 1930s England?","interventionism-suicide-american-republic","10:59 AM","government-debates","18"
