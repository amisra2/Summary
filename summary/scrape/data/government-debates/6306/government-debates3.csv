They claim to be conservatives, but have no idea of what a conservative is. They are simply fanatics who parade around as Christian or Conservative, or whatever sheeps clothing they need to act out their problems. If they were real conservatives, they would never consider attacking a country that has not attacked the US. They would rebel against the government having the right to dictate what you do in the privacy of you own home. They would apoplectic at the Executive and Legislative branches of government passing special laws prohibiting the citizens right to have their grievances redressed in a court of law. So, keep speaking up. Dont let their barrage of poop stop that. It is the best hope for the future.","literal-interpratation","03:58 PM","government-debates","31"

They have attempted very sucessfully to hijack conservatism and the republican party. But like a fart in a whirlwind, their time will pass.","literal-interpratation","04:41 PM","government-debates","32"

I will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you were referring to someone not on these forums. Afterall, you know the rules right?","literal-interpratation","08:37 PM","government-debates","33"

The fact that Bassman and I are the only ones that have really posted on this thread (with similiar views) seems to make me wonder.","literal-interpratation","11:16 PM","government-debates","37"
"09-07-2005","6306",3,"None","None","None","Howard Beale","160297","Sorry you feel that way. I was talking about some of the threads I have been on and what my experience was on them. You were not even on my mind -- in fact no individual was on my mind. That is why I asked you what made you think that?","literal-interpratation","12:12 AM","government-debates","38"
"09-07-2005","6306",3,"Steeeeve","None","Both of these were taken away because a federal law outweighs the state law(I believe it was the commerce clause for the marijuana one)....don't try to twist those around, both cases were decided correctly based on the law. You can access the marijuana one from last years Supreme Court via their webpage if you wanna read it. This is funny though considering that it was 6-3 with all the ""liberal"" judges voted in the 6. Gonzalas vs Kaich","Matthew S","160333","My point was that conservates and christonazis want the people to decide in the case of marriage but they turn to the courts to overturn the will of the people in such cases as medical marajuana, and assisted suicide. The conservates rail agianst these ""activist judges"" only on issues that they don't agree with. In the end the conservatives will end up stripping the courts of all power.","literal-interpratation","09:14 AM","government-debates","39"
"09-07-2005","6306",3,"Steeeeve","None","They turned to the courts because the ""will of the people"" conflicted with the federal governments laws (I will add that the federal government is elected by the will of the people). The courts only have one power to start out with. The power of the judicial. They are supposed to be the weakest branch (as shown in the federalist papers) for a reason you know. The courts aren't supposed to make law like you suggest they do. They simply look at the facts and decide on the case with regards to the law. Marriage is not in the constitution at all. So why would the Supreme Court rule on it? In fact, it is purely a state issue just like abortion should be. Stop having the courts make laws for your causes...try doing it the ""old fasion way"".","Matthew S","160426","I think then I will work to get the ERA passed. If that passes you have no arguement.","literal-interpratation","01:43 PM","government-debates","41"
"09-07-2005","6306",3,"Bassman","None","Matt, Matt, Matt. When are you ever going to get it? the homosexual lifestyle is unacceptable to the majority of Americans.","wsm2506","160436","Then they don't have to live it! But what right do they have to tell me how to live mine when it in no way affects them?","literal-interpratation","02:44 PM","government-debates","42"
"09-07-2005","6306",3,"Matthew S","None","I think then I will work to get the ERA passed. If that passes you have no arguement.","Steeeeve","160442","If that passes then hell yeah no arguements...the constitution would then reflect your views and you will have done it the correct way like women did back in the early 1900s. I'm all for doing whta you feel is right and trying to get your views done...but I prefer it be done the correct way and not having the courts make laws. Kind of related but can anyone tell me who said this: ""In America the majority should provail but the rights of the minority should be protected""","literal-interpratation","02:49 PM","government-debates","43"
"09-07-2005","6306",3,"Bassman","None","The idea is that liberals want to give SPECIAL rights to homosexuals. The existing laws already on the books should be enough, but no. The way this is going, if so-called ""hate speech-anti discriminatory"" laws are enacted, Pastors won't be able to preach without repercussions, nor will churches and related ministries be able determine who to hire. or bring on as volunteers.","wsm2506","160444","Please identify exactly what / which SPECIAL rights you are talking about. I have never understood this argument of supposedly ""SPECIAL"" rights. So, I guess you think it is correct for Pastors to preach hate and discrimination? Is that what Jesus taught them?","literal-interpratation","02:50 PM","government-debates","44"
