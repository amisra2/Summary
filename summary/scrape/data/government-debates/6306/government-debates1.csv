Try reading some of his cases and then read some history of the courts and the reasoning for the courts and how the courts are supposed to be the weakest branch AND THEN you might be able to talk. Calling Scalia a ""strict constructionist"" is wrong and shows little knowledge on his correct view of what a judges job is.","literal-interpratation","03:06 PM","government-debates","2"

"09-01-2005","6306",1,"Matthew S","None","Really? Am I to believe this artical with quotes from Scalia then? http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/08/083105scalia.htm Justice Scalia, who dissented on the sodomy ruling, said the Constitution must be strictly followed and chastised Congress for not appointing judges who are strict constitutionalists. Although he did not specifically mention the nomination of John Roberts to the Supreme Court, Scalia's message was clear. Throughout our nations history, the Supreme Court is the very place Americans rely upon as the final authority on cases of unfair and unjust treatment","Steeeeve","158497","actually, that is a speech he gives very often and can be heard on c-span. Maybe you should try listening to it. Those quotes are correct though. However this is not a quote from Scalia: and it shows that the people that wrote this article didn't listen to his speech at all. Then we have this: from that human rights guy. He must be thinking in the short term because I guess he missed the Dred Scott case. Understand how out government works before you go harping on Scalia and Roberts. The Judicial system is not there to make laws, they are there to follow them.","literal-interpratation","08:47 AM","government-debates","4"

Try reading the constitution. The supreme courts purpose is to protect peoples rights from the abuses of the legislature. The majority is not always right, or fair.","literal-interpratation","08:53 AM","government-debates","5"
"09-01-2005","6306",1,"Steeeeve","None","Actually the supreme court is supposed to be the weakest of the three branches. ANd you are correct ,the majority is not always right or fair...but we don't have 9 unelected people to decide what it right or fair, that is not their job. Would you like to show me in the constitution where it says the supreme court is there to ""protect peoples rights from abuses of legislature"". If you want to know what Judicial Power means then read the federalist papers. In fact, read some of them anyway because they do a good job argueing for what the constitution will provide. And in the anti-federalist papers you will see them talking about how the courts will assume too much power and start making laws...wow dead on.","Matthew S","158751","So you are saying that the minority should be at the mercy of the majority and that the minority should just learn to live with what they are given and have no recourse. I get what you are saying. If the majority thought the government aught to round up red headed people and kill them and congress went along with it though the law making prosess. The red headed people should have no right to sue or be able to stop the government from murdring them. You believe that congress should have no check. That all the laws they make should stand unchallenged.","literal-interpratation","08:29 PM","government-debates","7"

The arguement is over whose responsibility is it to protect the rights of the minority. I say it is the Supreme courts job to step in and protect the rights of the minority. Steeeeve, and many conservatives, say the court has no right to over rule the will of the majority and that minorites have no protected rights. Either that or the rights of the minority are a gift from the majority and that those rights are only in effect as long as it is the will of the majority.","literal-interpratation","09:29 PM","government-debates","9"

The fact that a President can veto and that the courts can strict down a law the violates the constitution as the constitution is considered the supreme law. However, not everything is in the constitution, such as gay rights, women rights, black rights, and abortion. This is why women and blacks got their way by going the correct way...via congress and they got the constitution changed (13,14,15, and 19th amendments). The people also have a check on congress because they are all elected (unlike a judge). In fact you can get rid of a representive every 2 years. It is not the way I am saying it, it just is what it is. Well this is nice...but thats not what our constitution says. If you want it to be this way then do it via congress. You seem to want the rules to bend to what you want and fail to realize that you need to confirm to how the rules are made otherwise why even have a set of rules to begin with?","literal-interpratation","01:21 AM","government-debates","11"

Since there is nothing in the constituition the mentions that red headed people have the right not to be killed. If congress and the people of the us decide that they should be killed. Equlity is equility and if it means that congress and the states need to be told that by the courts then so be it. You just don't want people to be equal citizens and want majority mob rule.","literal-interpratation","06:25 AM","government-debates","12"
"09-04-2005","6306",1,"Steeeeve","None","Sure there is. Try looking at the 14 amendment. However, can you apply the 14th amendment to say marriage or abortion? No. It doesn't have anything to do with that. You are still stuck in a black and white mindset. Scalia, and myself, are not 'strict' constructionists...reasonable interpretation using tradition, the text, and meaning of the constitution. Thats the easiest way to put it. Yeah, equality is equality. You gotta do it like the rest of us...VIA CONGRESS. Once again though...you aren't using the constitution but rather your own feelings, it isn't the courts job to tell congress what to do. If you wish to change the judges job then I suggest you convince congress of that or overthrow the government.","Matthew S","159253","NOt intirely true it the 14th also says ""without due process of law"" So if congress enacts the red headed people killing act and the majority of people support the act. The congress has removed the red headed peoples rights through due process of law. Since you believe that the courts should have no power over congress if they are using what is written in the constitution then the red headed people will have no recourse. This is exactly what is happening in califormia we are going through the legislature but it is still being opposed by selfrightous busy body christonazis. Ever heard of the fraise ""catch 22"" If we go through the courts, they say, we are trying to ""get activist judges to make law"". If we go through the legislature, they say, we are trying to ""go against the will of the people"". What a double standard that you preach. The problem is that conservatives want to control peoples personal lives. If this were not true they would not have a problem with gay marriage.","literal-interpratation","06:09 AM","government-debates","14"
