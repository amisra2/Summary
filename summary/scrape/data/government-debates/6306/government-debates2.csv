"09-04-2005","6306",2,"Matthew S","None","You are correct. The arguement is over whose responsibility is it to protect the rights of the minority. I say it is the Supreme courts job to step in and protect the rights of the minority. Steeeeve, and many conservatives, say the court has no right to over rule the will of the majority and that minorites have no protected rights. Either that or the rights of the minority are a gift from the majority and that those rights are only in effect as long as it is the will of the majority.","Bassman","159284","The idea is that liberals want to give SPECIAL rights to homosexuals. The existing laws already on the books should be enough, but no. The way this is going, if so-called ""hate speech-anti discriminatory"" laws are enacted, Pastors won't be able to preach without repercussions, nor will churches and related ministries be able determine who to hire. or bring on as volunteers.","literal-interpratation","08:41 AM","government-debates","16"

When are you ever going to get it? the homosexual lifestyle is unacceptable to the majority of Americans.","Matthew S","159300","So do I get a say on the heterosexual lifestyle that I find unacceptable. Mybe I will sue a heterosexual couple at random to have their marriage annulled because I don't believe in heterosexual marriage.

If a christian oganization wants to not hire or fire a gay person because they are gay then I want the same right to not hire or fire a person because they are christian. After all being christian is more of a choice then being gay. Why should christians get ""special rights""? I want equality one way of the other. Either we are all free to discriminate or no one is free to discriminate. For a religious organization that hides behind protected status and then discriminates when they can't be discriminated is not quite fair or equal.","literal-interpratation","09:14 AM","government-debates","18"

Matt, your hostility towards the truth has made it plain to me that there must have been someone who hurt you at some point in your life.

Included are the standards for sexual conduct. I'm not saying that Christians hate sex, nor am I saying that all sex is sinful. What the Word of God is saying is that God designed sex for pleasure and procreation. The two go hand-in-hand. And He also sanctioned it to be exclusive to the monogamous, heterosexual marriage relationship. Otherwise, it goes outside the standards that God laid out and it becomes sin.","literal-interpratation","09:32 AM","government-debates","21"

"09-06-2005","6306",2,"Matthew S","None","NOt intirely true it the 14th also says ""without due process of law"" So if congress enacts the red headed people killing act and the majority of people support the act. The congress has removed the red headed peoples rights through due process of law. Since you believe that the courts should have no power over congress if they are using what is written in the constitution then the red headed people will have no recourse. This is exactly what is happening in califormia we are going through the legislature but it is still being opposed by selfrightous busy body christonazis. Ever heard of the fraise ""catch 22"" If we go through the courts, they say, we are trying to ""get activist judges to make law"". If we go through the legislature, they say, we are trying to ""go against the will of the people"". What a double standard that you preach. The problem is that conservatives want to control peoples personal lives. If this were not true they would not have a problem with gay marriage.","Steeeeve","159943","Given that I am no Scalia, the 14th amendment says ""no state shall..."" so I assumed when you said congress you just referred to a state congress. And if you look at the 14th amendment it says ""nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."" which is the phrase I was referring to eariler. No, you just don't want to play by the rules. And controlling lives is the job of the government. You can't steal, murder, etc however you need to use the legislative branches to do this...not the judicial. As for gay marriage, I don't think there should be marriage in government anyway and to say marriage is not a religious term is crazy because it clearly is. I guess to say this country was not founded on Christian principles is crazy too but people claim that .","literal-interpratation","12:29 AM","government-debates","25"

"09-06-2005","6306",2,"Matthew S","None","If christians can discriminate against gay people I want their legal protections stripped from them so I can discriminate against christians.","Steeeeve","159948","so fight for it in congress like the rest of us..if you want to be equal then do it like the women did it back in the 1900's. I suggest you stop calling people christianazis (or whatever) unless you prefer being called names as well. Oh, and you can discrimate against christians in certain situations that are reasonable. For example you can refuse to hire a man at a female strip club. You can refuse to hire a gay priest because it is against the religion. You can refuse to hire a straight priest as the head of a gay organization because he/she doesn't support the views the organization is about.","literal-interpratation","12:37 AM","government-debates","27"

You are right however it says the states says nothing about congress. So the red headed people in my example would be suject to ""the red headed people killing act"", that I used as a example, and the majority of people and congress support the act. According to Bassman the red headed people should not have any recourse to turn to the courts. Since he, and other conservatives, believe that the courts, including the supreme court have no rights, under the constitution , to strike down any act of congress or the will of the people. Amendment XIV Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws Conservates and religious groups do not want to ""play by the rules"" on issues that concern them also. Such as the 2000 election, abortion, the right to die ect.... The people or Oregon voted for assisted suicide put it their constitution. Conservates sued to have the law overturned. The people of California voted to make marijauna legal for medical purposes. Guess what the conservates used the courts in both cases to over turn the will of the people. So don't give me this ativist judge, or ""play by the rules"" XXXX. Conservates can not have it both ways. Ahhh but that is the problem marriage is in government as as long as it is it sould be equal marriage regardless of sex or marriage for no one.","literal-interpratation","05:19 AM","government-debates","28"

The ERA: A Brief Introduction Section 1. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex. Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. Section 3. This amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification.","Matthew S","159964","Too bad the ERA didn't pass. Section 1 is intresting.

Abortion, how was this ever fair? Making up stuff in the constitution that isn't there. I just want the case to be overturned for being illegal and then have the states decide like it should have been to start out with. The right to die is not something I deal with too often so I gotta take a pass on that one. Both of these were taken away because a federal law outweighs the state law(I believe it was the commerce clause for the marijuana one)....don't try to twist those around, both cases were decided correctly based on the law. You can access the marijuana one from last years Supreme Court via their webpage if you wanna read it. This is funny though considering that it was 6-3 with all the ""liberal"" judges voted in the 6. Gonzalas vs Kaich It is equal...there is nothing that says it needs to be whatever you want though. This really is something for the other forums...stick to the constitution here which says nothing about marraige.","literal-interpratation","07:44 AM","government-debates","30"
