Am I to believe this artical with quotes from Scalia then? http://www.365gay.com/newscon05/08/083105scalia.htm Justice Scalia, who dissented on the sodomy ruling, said the Constitution must be strictly followed and chastised Congress for not appointing judges who are strict constitutionalists. Although he did not specifically mention the nomination of John Roberts to the Supreme Court, Scalia's message was clear. Throughout our nations history, the Supreme Court is the very place Americans rely upon as the final authority on cases of unfair and unjust treatment","Steeeeve","158497","actually, that is a speech he gives very often and can be heard on c-span.

Would you like to show me in the constitution where it says the supreme court is there to ""protect peoples rights from abuses of legislature"". If you want to know what Judicial Power means then read the federalist papers. In fact, read some of them anyway because they do a good job argueing for what the constitution will provide.

This is why women and blacks got their way by going the correct way...via congress and they got the constitution changed (13,14,15, and 19th amendments). The people also have a check on congress because they are all elected (unlike a judge). In fact you can get rid of a representive every 2 years.

No. It doesn't have anything to do with that. You are still stuck in a black and white mindset.

Yeah, equality is equality. You gotta do it like the rest of us...VIA CONGRESS.

"09-07-2005","6306",3,"Steeeeve","None","They turned to the courts because the ""will of the people"" conflicted with the federal governments laws (I will add that the federal government is elected by the will of the people). The courts only have one power to start out with. The power of the judicial. They are supposed to be the weakest branch (as shown in the federalist papers) for a reason you know. The courts aren't supposed to make law like you suggest they do. They simply look at the facts and decide on the case with regards to the law. Marriage is not in the constitution at all. So why would the Supreme Court rule on it? In fact, it is purely a state issue just like abortion should be.
