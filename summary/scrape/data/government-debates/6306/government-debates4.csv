The person is not the point though, the point being is the majority should prevail but they need to protect the rights of the minority. I just thought this was an interesting point.","literal-interpratation","02:58 PM","government-debates","46"

Whose job or what part of the governments job is it to protect the rights of the minoity against the majority?

"09-07-2005","6306",4,"None","None","None","Steeeeve","160454","I answered this already. It is the job of the majority to protect the rights of minority. The majority would obviosly be the elected officials...as opposed to say the judicial. The judicial can't do it because who is to say they aren't part of the majority?","literal-interpratation","03:12 PM","government-debates","48"

"09-07-2005","6306",4,"None","None","None","Steeeeve","160490","I am referring to things in US history. women were a ""minority"" in that they had no way to be a majority voice. Slaves is pretty obvious Mentally Retarded patients varies from state to state but here in VA they aren't really treated as they should be considering they are just as deserving of rights such as you or me however many of them don't have the ability to understand this concept. You could also look back in History to eugenics as well. They are just examples..I don't see your point","literal-interpratation","06:02 PM","government-debates","51"

If not to tell the majority they are trampling on the rights of the minority.

Read federalist 78 for a longer explanation of the judiciary. With that being said I should say that it is the job of the judicary to protect the constitution...so if the majority is violating the constitution in a way that tramples on minorities then it is the job of the judicial branch to say you can't do that. Also, if you don't like our system then I suggest you try to change it...but for now it just is what it is.","literal-interpratation","09:08 AM","government-debates","53"

Ultimatly it is the courts job to decide if congress has over steped its bounds by making laws that violate the constitution or laws that take away peoples rights to ""Petition the government for the redress of greviences"" http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.R.1100.IH: Do you believe that this is constitutional? How does this violate 1st admendment? If I were to get married in california I can not sue in federal court to have the state of michigan recognise the marriage. Under the 14th michigan would be required to either recognise all marriages from califonia or none. So do you think that it is the federal courts job to decide desputes between the states. If congress removes DOMA from federal court juisdiction how am I as a minority able to ensure my 1st anmendment rights are upheld.","literal-interpratation","01:33 PM","government-debates","54"
"09-08-2005","6306",4,"Steeeeve","None","No, you asked who protected the rights of the minorities. The constitution only protects rights granted in the constitution for all including minorities so if the majority is abusing them then the judges say that the majority is abusing them. A right to 'marry' for example is no where in the constitution so how can the judiciary protect this so called 'right'? However, freedom to speak is in the constitution with certain restrictions granted by traditions of when the amendment was first ratified. As to the link. Yes that is constitutional and has nothing to do with the first amendment. Congress can decide the jurisdiction of the courts.","Matthew S","160706","Ahh but http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:H.R.1100.IH: Takes away my 1st admendment right to to"" petition the government for a redress of grievances"" How can I as a gay man make a challenge to DOMA if I do not have the acceses to the federal courts? True marriage is not in the constitution, however, If one state grants marriage licenses to all couples regardless of sex , and another state will only accept one version. How is the 14th admendment then not voilated by such action? If the 14th admendment is violated, a grevience, how then do I make sure my first admendment rights ""to petition the government for a redress of grievances"" are then upheld?","literal-interpratation","03:07 PM","government-debates","56"
