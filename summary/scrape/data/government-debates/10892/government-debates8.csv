We need some enforced laws.","CUNxTime","301317","Although I do think that making it more difficult to get here is certainly one way to deter people from coming in the first place. My contention isn't even whether we need one or not. My contention is that if 55 to 60%+ say that they require a fence or some sort of deterrent as a pre-requisite of any immigration plan then in order to get anything done you'd need to give the people (thru their congressmen and senators) what they demand. Even disregarding the logic of an obstacle being, by definition, a way to stop or slow the infiltration at the border. The fact that an immigration plan would not be accepted or allowed by the public (and their legislators) without one makes it almost impossible to not include that in ANY working solution. Jim, I don't understand your passion regarding this issue. Perhaps I am missing something, that there is some aspect of a fence or technological wall or whatever that makes it so odious to you. What is it about the fence (or whatever it would be) that makes you so mad?","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","11:49 PM","government-debates","106"

The people have said NO to amnesty, they've said YES to a border fence and securing the entrance into this country so no more can come and go as they please.","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","01:36 PM","government-debates","110"

""We are not isolationists and we accept immigrants, assimilate (sp) them into our society and make attempts at protecting them from unlawful things. Our mistake has been permitting the southern border to be a passageway for hordes of people who have no intention of obeying our laws or paying taxes to enjoy the services of our government. Building a wall will not solve that problem. Building a wall is a negative thing to do and would create more animosity between the fine people of two countries."" As I said before, do not ever expect help on the southern border from the Mexican Govt. Their economy depends on the money sent back from here. As to the fence(or whatever obsticals), if you want to cheaply stop people from walking in there are only so many options. To stop someone from coming in along a 2 dimensional border is infinitely simpler and cheaper than chasing them all over the county in 4 dimensions. Will it stop all illegals, heck no. But when has a pound of cure Ever been better than an ounce of prevention? I've never found that to be the case.","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","02:49 PM","government-debates","112"
"02-13-2008","10892",8,"None","None","None","Ghost Rider","301533","I'd like to see how you guys propose we keep those mexicans from coming over to this country WITHOUT a fence. The border is too wide to patrol with simple guards, we need a way to bottleneck them so we can focus on key specific areas that'll make it easier for our guys to catch them and prosecute them. If we can't catch them then we sure as hell can't do anything to them. Meanwhile they're free to continue killing our border guards and trucking in more illegal immigrants, and we're left without options because people say a fence won't do anything, when a fence is the one and only thing we haven't tried yet!","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","01:42 PM","government-debates","113"

You realize there's fencing along many portions of the border now. Breached all the time. There's lots of other things we haven't tried.
