But these people can't buy FOOD, where are they going to get money for guns? So when the illegals get frustrated - they throw rocks (I am not condemning this), but guess what the border patrol agents get to respond with?"" That was in response to Ghost Rides post on illegals harming our border patrol. I have some first hand knowledge of these kind of incidents. It's not the 'poor huddled masses' that shoot at the agents. That is true. But it is the coyotes that bring them across, the drug cartels, AND corrupt elements of the Mexican Army! There have been many stand offs and even some fire fights. They also set wildfires to draw attention away from certain areas. You also talked about human rights abuses, 117 from 88-90. Let me PROMISE you, that is about the DAILY amount of abuses perpetrated by the coyotes and others against there own people. And that's not even scratching the surface of what the Mex. Army, Police, and other officials do, both at the border and on the routes bringing people through Mexico. As far as I'm concerned, we are Awesome in that regard. I don't blame them for wanting a better life. Not one bit. And there are many who come and contribute beautifully to our country. However, there are S. Loads that come, believing everyone here has three BMW's in the garage, and swimming pools in there back yards. They have NO qualms about ripping off the tax payers and citizens anyway possible. Though my wife, I see it a lot. She gets SOOOO Mad at the people who come here and give the rest a bad name. I wish they were all like my wife, but the sad fact is that many aren't. As long as there are large groups of people who don't care one wit about our country except for what they can 'get out of it', without giving anything back, there will be citizens who are upset about it. Nobody is going to believe this but I picked up a hitch hiker on the way over here (to the coffee shop I'm at. He said that he can't get work like he used to because a lot of 'undocumented worker' have flooded the job market. His name is Carl and he does house framing (or just framing, I'm not knowledgeable about the construction industry. He called himself a framer). Anyway, I gave him my card and told him if he and his wife need to pick up some hours this summer I'd see what I can do by giving him some condos to clean. His wife and kids are still I'm MD living with his brother, because he can't make enough to bring them down here and get their own place because the job market is flooded and wages when he does get work are suppressed....","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","02:24 PM","government-debates","79"

Also - if you are 100% native, I questions about the following. There are/were many tribes in the US - just which tribe's traditons, lifestyle and identity should we all be taking on?"" I have to say that it is a scientific fact that ALL humans started in Africa and spread from there. The 'native Americans' were descendants of people who came across the Alaskan land bridge so Technically, they too weren't truly 'native'. This Idea of going this far back in time to redress grievances is sort of futile and unproductive, because if you go back further the picture changes. Then go back EVEN FURTHER the picture changes again. Furthermore, in that time and age, Might made Right was the way it was done with warfare, land, and power. It wasn't until WWI and beyond that, because of the United States , countries that WON wars gave back the conquered land AND aided the LOSERS to help fix the damage.

I would be willing to guess that most of the gunfire deaths are due, once again, to drug dealers - not your average immigrant seeking work. Considering HUNDREDS of illegals cross every day, it is also hardly indicating that there is a huge problem with the average illegal acting out violently. Plus my information shows that border patrol agents hardly have their hands tied in responding, which was Ghostrider's assertion. You are right about the coyotes. They will frequently pay a coyote to get them accross the border. That money often comes from a relative already in the states. It is considered an investment - to get them over to make more money. Its not money they can find easily or give up lightly. Paying for a coyote is not indicative that they have money to throw around on guns just so they can hang at the border and start shooting border patrol agents. My implication of racism is based 100% on personal experience. I went through the process. The people on the border are rude, the buildings are unsanitary, there aren't even doors on the bathrooms. They were unwilling to answer questions (I got those answered by the Mexican guards outside the US buildings). A year in they ""lost"" our paperwork which was miraculously found when my senator called them. We treat Mexicans like #### at the border. Period. As do I. As I said, I don'y condone it. I just don't agree with turning these people into monsters. They aren't. At least not more or less so than anyone else.","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","02:50 PM","government-debates","81"

Then the Mexicans must be racist against Mexicans, because they don't even have restrooms in most of their country, and if they do, you've got to pay for it and most don't have doors... Also, try to walk around in their country after 8pm or so. ""Gringo"" is about as good as the words get that they call you. I had a lady in the AMERICAN Airlines line at the airport in Mex. City tell my wife (in Spanish)to ""take that F'n piece of trash back to EE.UU."" I smiled and waved because I didn't know what she'd said until later when my wife called. Trust me, you want to find some racists, Look south. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right but after all the abuse I'm sure they take it probably gets hard. p.s. the doors were probably stolen like a set of hub caps","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","03:09 PM","government-debates","82"
"02-08-2008","10892",6,"jitobear","300862","You are missing my point. I simply asked WHY her ancestors came here to point out that its not so different from WHY most illegals are coming here now. I agree they should come over legally. I agree there are those that are criminal elements. There are #######s everywhere. What I don't agree with is the demonization of these people and the misrepresentation of the motivations of the majority of them. Nor do I care for the racist slant of Ghost-rider's ""them and their way's"" and ""they should embrace American traditions and culture"" statements. They smack of ethnocentricity and I would expect them to tick you off as well. I also don't swallow the poor, innocent America crud. My immigration story is just one example. Maquiladoras are another. Tiene una esposa de Mexico y viviste alla y nunca anprendo la lengua? Camine en Mexico despues 8 an la noche sin problemas. Posible eres un cabron? I have spent lots of time on both our borders. The reason its racist is because of the difference. If we were that way everywhere I would have nothing to say.","CUNxTime","300875","About the 'ancestor' part, I know that was off topic. I just couldn't help commenting on the Native Am. thing because I hear the ""Your ancestors were immigrants too"" thing a lot and, well, as I said technically the N.A. were immigrants and going back far enough Blah Blah Blah. I do speak a touch of Spanish since my wife and sister in law and all the other's that pass through my house. When I was in Mex. for 2 1/2 months I was starting to get it, but they talk so damn fast. My wife learned English in 4 months and it drives her crazy when people that have been here years don't bother to learn.... In Mexico City, it can be pretty dangerous to go walking after 8, although if I was a 'Cabron' (which means sort of SUPER Machoman) I think I'd have stayed out all night. However, liking my life, my wallet, and the money in it and NOT being a CabronMacho man, we got in fairly early...","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","04:49 PM","government-debates","84"

When PAN wins an election they fire almost 100% of the gov. workers and replace them with PAN workers. If PRI wins next time, they do the same thing. Very few people are willing to sacrifice for the country. Hell, very few are willing to NOT defraud the country. When people say they are 'Victims' of the corrupt govt., well it's hard to feel sorry, since the same 'Victims' from this year will be the perpetrators after the next election...","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","04:53 PM","government-debates","85"

However, in addition to being universally hated, I also happen to think that this plan for fixing the Illegal Immigration problem could actually work. First, to prevent the issue from having to be addressed again in the future, a border fence both physical and technological with patrols and monitors to prevent ingress from both above and below. After the fence is in place, an offer is made to those that are here in the country illegally. They can chose two options. 1. Volunteer to go back to their country of origin and they will receive a one time payment of $6000.00 per adult and $1500.00 for child. Many of them come here to save up this kind of money and it is their goal to leave after saving this anyway. 2. If they don't want to leave, they can register to stay provided they a. pay back taxes. b. pay a fine c. learn English and serve a probationary period to show they can support themselves and commit no crimes. I believe this will help address the problem of integration, prevent the US from spending scads of money in future entitlements and chain migration, bring people into the system and make them part of the economy and tax base.
