Secondly, there were never ""hundreds of millions"" of Indians in what is now the United States. That's quite a burden you've had put upon you. Button one or button two. Oh the humanity. I bet your eyes have even been accosted by the Spanish language on signboards. I can see now why fragging children would be warranted. Someone like you can only take so much. What's next? Burritos on the lunch menus in our schools. Kill them all. ""Madam, I have dined with some of the ugliest g**damn b**ches in my time.

Chain an illegal (who has use of their legs*) to them thar bikes. Force em to churn away and power our great nations energy demands. Cheap, clean, renewable energy! When they die at the wheel, grind em up to feed the others. *Those who can't power tha Machina will be either used as fooder for the others or harvested fer der organses. This includes tha babies. Ya know how hard it is to gets da baby organs? This plan can be used fer da homelesses too. And da poor. And dem dar minorities who bellyaches too much. And for dem minorities who don't bellyaches. After a whiles, we'd have to send in recruiters to the ferner countries to get new migrants. Cause I thunk that the ones who are heres would probably use their gypsy like powas to warn the others away to not come here illegally. Even though there's plenty of work fer dem to dos. Why I gots 2 of them migrant day laberers in mah celler hooked up to the machines poweren my lites and lectric fence. They get good food from the hamster bottles I got hooked up fer dem. And their dried poo is also an energy source. I figurin the carbon footprint of this energy source is in the negatives. So, We cans see carbon credits to other countries for some incomes to pay off our debts. Or to hire the recruiters needed to get migrants to come to the land of the free where just us prevails. My alternative plan B is ta shoots dem. But, the eco-greenies get upset at the lead from the bullets contaminating the environments.","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","05:34 PM","government-debates","36"

Although, the amount the country will save in future entitlement spending will be HUGE either way.","sinjin","300383","You might like to read this: http://www.aila.org/content/default.aspx?docid=24201","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","06:24 PM","government-debates","37"

The plan not only reforms immigration it also provides a 'path to citizenship' and etc... There is at least 1 mistake though (in your link) where it states that undocumented workers aren't able to receive welfare-Ever. What it should say is that they can't receive Federal entitlements etc... ""Welfare"" programs are run by the states and include food stamps and health clinics and etc... I would like to thank ZarDoz for adding his intelligent info into the debate and I would like to congratulate him on the most clear, concise, and articulate post that I have YET seen from HIM!!! Everyone should be required to read Zardoz's post, such is his intellect!","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","07:18 PM","government-debates","38"
"02-06-2008","10892",3,"flygirl","300270","I STILL say we annex the whole country of Mexico, turn it over to the washington bureaucracy,line our pockets with the proceeds on the arable land, shipping, tourism, desireable climate, oil and other natural resources, and turn the biggest number of potential illegal immigrants into educated, productive, taxpaying, CITIZENS. Line ""our"" pockets? Who is the ""we"" in that one? Corporations would love the cheap labor, and unions would crumble as hordes of new IDPs assume semi-skilled positions for minimum wage. All it would take to turn that country around is getting rid of their thoroughly corrupt, totally entrenched, government and this is the only way I see to accomplish that. Here here! Might help if we did the same thing!","Taxi Rob","300432","I'm for CUNxTime's plan except for the cash payments. A free ride home and lesson learned is all the more we should pay for. Just as I believe we need single payer health care for our citizens, I also believe a viable guest worker program like Canada's would solve our labor needs in agriculture, and could be expanded to include other industries as needed. Think of it as a Mexican temp-to-hire program. As long as qualified Americans are not passed over, I'm all for it. Maybe English language proficiency can be a requirement in skilled and semi-skilled trades, so that instead of paying coyotes to sneak them across the border they'll be paying ESL instructors to give them the skill to walk across legally. Already trained, pre-screened employees would be a welcome import in place of illicit labor anyday.","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","01:22 AM","government-debates","39"

Never.","Taxi Rob","300434","You touch upon a favorite subject of mine. What the hell is American culture exactly? I used to work with a Klansman. He was always talking about the assault on White culture. He could never exactly tell me what White culture was, of course. I think the same about Black culture. As it is it seems to be defined by its difference from White culture, which of course does not exist. A Japanese person needs only to live in America (not even full time,) and declare allegience to its government to become an American, yet an American, even if he were to get Japanese citizenship, would never be Japanese, am I correct in that? If anyone can tell me what exactly American culture is apart from capitalism and exploitation, please explain it to me.","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","01:37 AM","government-debates","40"

I like that analogy. I like salad. But, come to think about it... I don't like tomatoes. Nor Cucumbers. So, you can keep them. Actually, if you were to serve me a salad with that junk in it. I'd pick them out and flick them against the wall. I'd feed them to my dog. But, I don't think he likes them either. And, when I think about that analogy in use for America and it's diverse peoples, I think about who represents the tomatoes and the cucumbers. And I realise, I don't really like them and I don't want them in my country. 'Not in my salad' is my motto. I know it's yours too. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go enjoy a salad. Made with genetically pure lettuce. A little home grown spinach. Maybe a radish or two if they're quiet and know their place. I think a mushroom would also do. And then I'll drown it all with pure white dressing until it all tastes the same. Well, that's how I like my salad.

I know it kind of irks but it will take something like that to get a large amount of people to take advantage of the plan. Like I said there's something in it for EVERYONE to hate Which is why it just might work! BTW, the govt. is pretty bad there. My wife and I were talking about it this morning. Whichever party is in control basically treats the govt. like a big piggy bank. When power changes hands there's nearly 100% turn over in the govt. bureaucracies...","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","10:15 AM","government-debates","45"
