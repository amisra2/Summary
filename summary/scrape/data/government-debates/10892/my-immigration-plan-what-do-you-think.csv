However, in addition to being universally hated, I also happen to think that this plan for fixing the Illegal Immigration problem could actually work. First, to prevent the issue from having to be addressed again in the future, a border fence both physical and technological with patrols and monitors to prevent ingress from both above and below. After the fence is in place, an offer is made to those that are here in the country illegally. They can chose two options. 1. Volunteer to go back to their country of origin and they will receive a one time payment of $6000.00 per adult and $1500.00 for child. Many of them come here to save up this kind of money and it is their goal to leave after saving this anyway. 2. If they don't want to leave, they can register to stay provided they a. pay back taxes. b. pay a fine c. learn English and serve a probationary period to show they can support themselves and commit no crimes. I believe this will help address the problem of integration, prevent the US from spending scads of money in future entitlements and chain migration, bring people into the system and make them part of the economy and tax base.

It's not really a loophole but can be exploited if you know how to manipulate the system. For example, Mr and Mrs John Doe have 4+ kids and each make about 16K each. Not a whole lot. If they are 'married' and file together, they get a return on 32k with deductions. The EIC tops out at 2 kids. If they are seperated or not legally married or even divorced. They could file as such and claim 2 kids each...at the ~$16k figure...each claiming the 2 kid max for EIC. From the forms I'm looking at, that could net them close to 3* as much return in freebies (close to $10k total). Plus, being poor, they'd get all their FICA back or have a 0 liability. So, rather than truely rewarding the good ole fashioned nuclear family for the poor, the system rewards the seperation of such. This pretty much works only for large families...but, the sterotype of the Hispanic is often such. I'm sure you could sit down and figure out exactly what the perameters are for this. The jist of my arguement in the economics thread was to dispell the notion that illegals have to pay FICA and the only reason they do is often because of ignorance of how it works. Adding on to the premis that if the illegals were ever to file legal tax returns they'd be taking massive amounts of money out of the 'system' many supporters claim they put into. If they think pulling out medical and school 'resources' from the US system is bad, I wonder if they have thought about them giving 0 fica and taking $3k+ a year per adult from the pot too. I'm 100% in favor of increasing the numbers of legal immigrants here. An advanced worker visa program or similar would be okay. I'm NOT in favor of amnesty as most would become the above working poor and a further drain on the system.","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","11:33 PM","government-debates","72"

That was in response to Ghost Rides post on illegals harming our border patrol. I have some first hand knowledge of these kind of incidents. It's not the 'poor huddled masses' that shoot at the agents. That is true. But it is the coyotes that bring them across, the drug cartels, AND corrupt elements of the Mexican Army! There have been many stand offs and even some fire fights. They also set wildfires to draw attention away from certain areas. You also talked about human rights abuses, 117 from 88-90. Let me PROMISE you, that is about the DAILY amount of abuses perpetrated by the coyotes and others against there own people. And that's not even scratching the surface of what the Mex. Army, Police, and other officials do, both at the border and on the routes bringing people through Mexico. As far as I'm concerned, we are Awesome in that regard. I don't blame them for wanting a better life. Not one bit. And there are many who come and contribute beautifully to our country. However, there are S.

I would be willing to guess that most of the gunfire deaths are due, once again, to drug dealers - not your average immigrant seeking work. Considering HUNDREDS of illegals cross every day, it is also hardly indicating that there is a huge problem with the average illegal acting out violently. Plus my information shows that border patrol agents hardly have their hands tied in responding, which was Ghostrider's assertion. You are right about the coyotes. They will frequently pay a coyote to get them accross the border. That money often comes from a relative already in the states. It is considered an investment - to get them over to make more money. Its not money they can find easily or give up lightly. Paying for a coyote is not indicative that they have money to throw around on guns just so they can hang at the border and start shooting border patrol agents. My implication of racism is based 100% on personal experience. I went through the process. The people on the border are rude, the buildings are unsanitary, there aren't even doors on the bathrooms. They were unwilling to answer questions (I got those answered by the Mexican guards outside the US buildings).

However, in addition to being universally hated, I also happen to think that this plan for fixing the Illegal Immigration problem could actually work. First, to prevent the issue from having to be addressed again in the future, a border fence both physical and technological with patrols and monitors to prevent ingress from both above and below. After the fence is in place, an offer is made to those that are here in the country illegally. They can chose two options. 1. Volunteer to go back to their country of origin and they will receive a one time payment of $6000.00 per adult and $1500.00 for child. Many of them come here to save up this kind of money and it is their goal to leave after saving this anyway. 2. If they don't want to leave, they can register to stay provided they a. pay back taxes. b. pay a fine c. learn English and serve a probationary period to show they can support themselves and commit no crimes.

First we need to clearly understand why we have such a problem at our Mexican border...a problem that does not exist...to near the extent that it does here...anywhere else in the world. There are few fences between other countries. They do not need them either. We have a country full of poverty-stricken people (Mexico), just across the river from a country of great wealth and opportunity to escape poverty (U.S.A.). For the poor of Mexico, there is no escape within their country. There is a great divide between the masses and the ruling rich that will never go away because of the corruption and illegalities that are permitted and even backed by their government. I don't blame the poor Mexican's for wanting to come to the U.S.A. However, you build fences, you will be wasting money. They will tunnel under, they will die in the unventilated trailers they are told will take them to the promised land for a few thousand dollars each, they will still find a way to cross the fence and trek across desert areas only to die of exposure. The fence idea is not good. What they do in other countries is to arrest people and deal with them through legal processes including deportation, fines, etc. Why, they even do that in dear old Mexico. That's about as stupid a thing as I've heard all day...pay them to go home?!? They'd only return for another handout. Whatever method you choose to identify the ones who've been here once, they will figure out how to defeat...even if it means burning off their fingerprints. a. Who would admit how long they'd been here and come to any agreement on how much back taxes they owed? b. That may already be part of our law. c. It's not against the law to not speak English. It's not required of legal immigrants to learn English (that I know of)...being able to support one's family and remaining crime free are not required for existing citizen's to remain here...why should it be required of illegals? Your plan is greatly flawed. We've let this Mexican border/illegal alien problem go ignored for so long now that we have a tremendous problem in dealing with the ones that are already here. There are MILLIONS of them. Many of them are hard working honest people who truly want to make a better life for themselves. Many of them are worthless, alcholics, criminals and in general UNDESIRABLE people who do nothing more than terrify others. I think it's been mentioned here already that 25 people PER DAY die in the US at the hands of ILLEGAL ALIENS. That's about 9000 people per year...(and Hillary wants to give them all driver's licenses (SO THEY CAN VOTE FOR HER AND OTHER WORTHLESS LIBERALS). The criminals should be deported. The borders should be sealed to the extent possible and all new ""crossers"" caught should be sent right back home. Those that have been here for years and worked hard and stayed out of legal trouble should be allowed to stay and apply for citizenship just like the MILLIONS of other people who have successfully gone through that process. A short-cut to citizenship should not exist. Whatever is done should be within the law. If the laws are not to be observed, they should be removed from the books. There are some local law enforcement agencies who have developed the skills and procedures required to start deportation proceedings against illiegal alien criminals and they are doing just that....sending them back! The Mexican government is complaining about it. Praise the Lord for the Cobb County Sheriff. All you bleeding hearts who take up universally for the illegal aliens should listen to the stories of the people who live in neighborhoods that have been torn apart by the worthless bastards who choose to obey no laws. Talk to women who have been raped by them...talk to people who have lost family members to a drunk driving illegal alien.

I think you actually would. What a stupid, selfish thing to do. We are not at war with people who want to be free from oppression and poverty. I do not favor giving them money to come out of poverty, but I do favor giving them a chance to succeed in life...legally.

We need some enforced laws.","CUNxTime","301317","Although I do think that making it more difficult to get here is certainly one way to deter people from coming in the first place. My contention isn't even whether we need one or not. My contention is that if 55 to 60%+ say that they require a fence or some sort of deterrent as a pre-requisite of any immigration plan then in order to get anything done you'd need to give the people (thru their congressmen and senators) what they demand. Even disregarding the logic of an obstacle being, by definition, a way to stop or slow the infiltration at the border. The fact that an immigration plan would not be accepted or allowed by the public (and their legislators) without one makes it almost impossible to not include that in ANY working solution. Jim, I don't understand your passion regarding this issue. Perhaps I am missing something, that there is some aspect of a fence or technological wall or whatever that makes it so odious to you. What is it about the fence (or whatever it would be) that makes you so mad?","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","11:49 PM","government-debates","106"

""We are not isolationists and we accept immigrants, assimilate (sp) them into our society and make attempts at protecting them from unlawful things. Our mistake has been permitting the southern border to be a passageway for hordes of people who have no intention of obeying our laws or paying taxes to enjoy the services of our government. Building a wall will not solve that problem. Building a wall is a negative thing to do and would create more animosity between the fine people of two countries."" As I said before, do not ever expect help on the southern border from the Mexican Govt. Their economy depends on the money sent back from here. As to the fence(or whatever obsticals), if you want to cheaply stop people from walking in there are only so many options. To stop someone from coming in along a 2 dimensional border is infinitely simpler and cheaper than chasing them all over the county in 4 dimensions. Will it stop all illegals, heck no. But when has a pound of cure Ever been better than an ounce of prevention? I've never found that to be the case.","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","02:49 PM","government-debates","112"

The border is too wide to patrol with simple guards, we need a way to bottleneck them so we can focus on key specific areas that'll make it easier for our guys to catch them and prosecute them. If we can't catch them then we sure as hell can't do anything to them. Meanwhile they're free to continue killing our border guards and trucking in more illegal immigrants, and we're left without options because people say a fence won't do anything, when a fence is the one and only thing we haven't tried yet!","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","01:42 PM","government-debates","113"
