And you can't honestly say someone is a bigot because they want to demarcate the borders of THEIR country. Mexico controls the movement of people into ITS country, you should see what they do to the Guatemalans they catch coming thought their country, rape, murder, forced slavery... But that's not what we do. Protecting a border is the fundamental responsibility of a country and to say differently is both naive and dangerous. But still you have not talked about the actual proposal...","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","02:28 PM","government-debates","16"

Btw we subsidize that aggressive policy in southern Mexico.","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","02:41 PM","government-debates","19"
"02-05-2008","10892",2,"sinjin","300353","Have you been to Rome? How about Mexico City?","CUNxTime","300355","Yes, I was married in Mexico City to my Mexican wife. We traveled the country extensively for the TWO and a HALF months we stayed there. I can tell you from from first hand experience that holding on to only Spanish and refusing to learn English holds many of them back, both legal and illegal. In fact, I have to carry a second cell phone so that I can answer it for my wife bricklayer cousin who hasn't tried to learn English. It's cost him a fortune.... You can't just stamp your feet and say ""Borders are rascist"" ALL of human history calls out against you. Maybe one day, we will have ""ONE WORLD"" but the way to get there isn't to tear down to achievers to make the others happy! Anyway, does anyone have a comment on the plan?","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","02:50 PM","government-debates","20"
"02-05-2008","10892",2,"None","None","None","Ghost Rider","300356","If mexicans want to come and live in this country then they should give up all that they know. They should abolish their identity as mexicans and fully embrace the traditions, lifestyle and identity as an American. In any other country in the world you couldn't move there and keep your identity, you couldn't go to Japan and remain a member of Britain, you'd have to become Japanese. So anybody that comes to America should become American in orientation, language and customs. I'm sick and tired of bending over backwards to cater to people who want to turn America into the country they ran away from. We're the sovereign nation, we shouldn't have to cater to anybody. If anything they should cater to us and submit and become like everyone else here since they want to live here so badly.","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","02:51 PM","government-debates","21"

You are nuts! If we treated illegals in our country HALF as poorly as they do in the countries they come from there wouldn't be a 'problem' But again that's not my point. My point is I think the Proposal would go a LONG way to Fixing the situation...","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","02:55 PM","government-debates","22"

In the US we speak English - and that language is not native to this soil. Unless you are Native American - any tradition you participate in is also not native to this soil. America, consists of a lot more than the US. Mexicans are already Americans. As are Guatamalans, Canadians, Argentinians, Chileans, Bolivians, (shall I go on?). Frankly, the dominant language spoke in AMERICA is actually Spanish. A good hunk of the United States was Mexico. The Spanish heritage in this country pre-dates any English speaking heritage by HUNDREDS of years. I actually do believe you should learn the language that is prevelantly spoken in any area you are going to live. In the US, that is English. However, we are made up of all kinds of people from all over the world - there is no reason to give up your cultural identity. And your self-righteous rant was just too damned funny.","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","04:17 PM","government-debates","27"

It takes only a few generations.","flygirl","300366","Sure, a lot have, by choice. BUT, just around here (nebraska) we have thriving czech, latvian, vietnamese, japanese, german, various middle-eastern, as well as hispanic cultures who have done nothing of the kind. I was in NYC last week, walked about 2 miles, heard neighborhoods where even the small children were speaking Italian, or one of the slovakian languages, even Gaelic in one little area. Our ethnic cultures are in no danger, believe me. It's part of what makes America wonderful.","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","04:21 PM","government-debates","29"

We all judge. I judge you to be an alright fellow with some rather dumb ideas. Why $6000?","CUNxTime","300367","That's about the amount average that will be owed in back taxes by the ones who stay. I was hoping they could somewhat balance out... Although, the amount the country will save in future entitlement spending will be HUGE either way. Also, I think that amount is what many would easily accept to go back, they could build a house or start a small business with that. At least, that is what I've been told by many of them and that gibes with what I witnessed when I was there...","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","04:23 PM","government-debates","30"
