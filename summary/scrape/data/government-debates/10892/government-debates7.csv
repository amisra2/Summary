"02-09-2008","10892",7,"CUNxTime","None","First, to prevent the issue from having to be addressed again in the future, a border fence both physical and technological with patrols and monitors to prevent ingress from both above and below. After the fence is in place, an offer is made to those that are here in the country illegally. They can chose two options. 1. Volunteer to go back to their country of origin and they will receive a one time payment of $6000.00 per adult and $1500.00 for child. Many of them come here to save up this kind of money and it is their goal to leave after saving this anyway. 2. If they don't want to leave, they can register to stay provided they a. pay back taxes. b. pay a fine c. learn English and serve a probationary period to show they can support themselves and commit no crimes.","jim's trucking","301020","A fence would not solve the problem or keep it from returning. First we need to clearly understand why we have such a problem at our Mexican border...a problem that does not exist...to near the extent that it does here...anywhere else in the world. There are few fences between other countries. They do not need them either. We have a country full of poverty-stricken people (Mexico), just across the river from a country of great wealth and opportunity to escape poverty (U.S.A.). For the poor of Mexico, there is no escape within their country. There is a great divide between the masses and the ruling rich that will never go away because of the corruption and illegalities that are permitted and even backed by their government. I don't blame the poor Mexican's for wanting to come to the U.S.A. However, you build fences, you will be wasting money. They will tunnel under, they will die in the unventilated trailers they are told will take them to the promised land for a few thousand dollars each, they will still find a way to cross the fence and trek across desert areas only to die of exposure. The fence idea is not good. What they do in other countries is to arrest people and deal with them through legal processes including deportation, fines, etc. Why, they even do that in dear old Mexico. That's about as stupid a thing as I've heard all day...pay them to go home?!? They'd only return for another handout. Whatever method you choose to identify the ones who've been here once, they will figure out how to defeat...even if it means burning off their fingerprints. a. Who would admit how long they'd been here and come to any agreement on how much back taxes they owed? b. That may already be part of our law. c. It's not against the law to not speak English. It's not required of legal immigrants to learn English (that I know of)...being able to support one's family and remaining crime free are not required for existing citizen's to remain here...why should it be required of illegals? Your plan is greatly flawed. We've let this Mexican border/illegal alien problem go ignored for so long now that we have a tremendous problem in dealing with the ones that are already here. There are MILLIONS of them. Many of them are hard working honest people who truly want to make a better life for themselves. Many of them are worthless, alcholics, criminals and in general UNDESIRABLE people who do nothing more than terrify others. I think it's been mentioned here already that 25 people PER DAY die in the US at the hands of ILLEGAL ALIENS. That's about 9000 people per year...(and Hillary wants to give them all driver's licenses (SO THEY CAN VOTE FOR HER AND OTHER WORTHLESS LIBERALS). The criminals should be deported. The borders should be sealed to the extent possible and all new ""crossers"" caught should be sent right back home. Those that have been here for years and worked hard and stayed out of legal trouble should be allowed to stay and apply for citizenship just like the MILLIONS of other people who have successfully gone through that process. A short-cut to citizenship should not exist. Whatever is done should be within the law. If the laws are not to be observed, they should be removed from the books. There are some local law enforcement agencies who have developed the skills and procedures required to start deportation proceedings against illiegal alien criminals and they are doing just that....sending them back! The Mexican government is complaining about it. Praise the Lord for the Cobb County Sheriff. All you bleeding hearts who take up universally for the illegal aliens should listen to the stories of the people who live in neighborhoods that have been torn apart by the worthless bastards who choose to obey no laws. Talk to women who have been raped by them...talk to people who have lost family members to a drunk driving illegal alien. I'm sure your can understand why these people might wonder what the hell we're doing just letting these ILLEGAL aliens continue to stream across the border AND STAY HERE!!","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","08:23 PM","government-debates","92"
"02-09-2008","10892",7,"None","None","None","Ghost Rider","301023","Unlike you JT, I think the fence is a good idea. Yes the mexicans will still want to get across, but the beautiful idea about putting up a fence is that there would only be one point in which a truck can get through. You set up a single entrance/exit checkin point go coming and going, you inspect each vehicle very thouroughly. The fewer points where a truck load of mexicans can cross, the easier it is the catch them and send them right back. You can't cross the border if there's nothing but wall in your way with the only way in being 500 miles away.","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","08:36 PM","government-debates","93"

Whatever method you choose to identify the ones who've been here once, they will figure out how to defeat...even if it means burning off their fingerprints."" There would be a DNA data base as well as a reward system for those that chose to 'pay to stay'. The penalties would be made clear when they signed the agreement to receive the money in the first place, loss of property here and in Mexico, jail, deportation of the offender and family, etc... You must give them a reason to go home--I'm talking solutions not ""the stupidest thing I ever heard..."" How are you going to get them to volunteer Einstein? The reason MOST of them come here is to make enough money to go home, buy land, build a house or start a business. A one time payment from us is MUCH cheaper than welfare, earned income tax credits, E.R. visits, car accidents, overburdened schools etc... So I'm sorry for being so freakin stupid. Just TRYING to come up with a solution... As far as the fence not stopping all of them.. That is true. However, it would make things very much harder. Coyotes used to cost under $1000, now it is sometimes over $5K. The harder it is, the more prohibitively expensive... and BTW- when the Mex. army finds illegals in their country they rape and sometimes even enslave them for years on end. Its a picnic here compared to the torture that happens to Guatemalans and Salvadorians and etc... Einstein Jim then said, ""a. Who would admit how long they'd been here and come to any agreement on how much back taxes they owed? b. That may already be part of our law. c. It's not against the law to not speak English. It's not required of legal immigrants to learn English (that I know of)...being able to support one's family and remaining crime free are not required for existing citizen's to remain here...why should it be required of illegals?"" A. We could figure out a good average. One condition of their probation would be not lying on this kind of thing. If they got caught, they'd put their visa in jeopardy. B. So what, if you can't get them to follow the law.....Duh. C. They are under NO obligation to follow the rules. If they don't want to they can take the money and go HOME. We should only let people in that are beneficial to our country i.e. can support themselves and be crime free. WHO's the idiot now. You want us to let in anyone? Your MIND is FLAWED! It should be required because THEY want something from US, you smarty! They must be willing to follow the rules or they shouldn't be allowed to come. DO YOU WANT TO FIND A SOLUTION OR NOT? DO YOU THINK YOU'LL EVER GET AGREEMENT TO LET IN ANYONE TO BE CRIMINALS ON WELFARE. USE YOUR BRAIN. MY Plan allows those who don't give a S#@T about this country to take some money and go home (good riddance). Those that truly want to stay and ADD something and are willing to put their money and hard work where their mouth is can stay and we get the best ones. The other's can go rot. I should know, my wife is from Mexico and she's a great one. There are plenty who aren't and a bit of cash now will save us a LOT of expense and pain later!!!","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","09:03 PM","government-debates","94"

We don't need a physical wall. We need a legal wall that keeps illegal aliens from earning any money to send back home. We need a legal wall to keep them from driving in the US. We need a legal wall to deport criminals speedily so that their financial burden is shifted back to Mexico where it belongs. We need a legal wall top prevent anchor babies and payments to their parents being made out of our funds. We need a legal wall to pressure the Mexican government into discouraging instead of encouraging illegal border crossings. We need a legal wall to allow guest workers to cross the border, report to authorites and go back to Mexico on a regular basis without citizenship and voting privileges. We don't need a block wall like the Soviets used to squash freedoms within what used to be a perfectly beautiful city. We don't need your petty, adhominem, adolescent attacks. Why don't you go back to school and learn how to get your point across without using all caps? P.S. Your immigration plan SUCKS!!........BIG TIME!! P.P.S.

""I'm betting that had Mexico built a wall to keep their people in (as the Soviets did in Berlin), you'd be cheering every time some poor bastard got shot in the back for trying to escape the poor lifestyle offered him in Mexico"" Well, Jimbo, I highly doubt it considering I'm married to a Mexican woman. Didn't expect that did ya? Are you always this right about every subject you tackle? Why would you assume I want to see people get shot? And why the personal attacks, Jimbo? From your first post here you insulted me. Why not stick with the plan. YOU don't like the wall. Fine say so. But... The wall is part of the plan because that is a caveat made necessary by the about 55-60% of the population that demands it as part of ANY comprehensive immigration plan. Tell me, how do you expect to get anything done, Psychic Jim, if you have 55% of the against it from the get go because it doesn't include some sort of wall or fence? Well? Status Quo? How do you get anything done if over half won't support it without one certain stipulation? You see Jimbo, to get anything done requires that people support it. I plainly stated in the beginning that there are elements that both sides will Well? Status Quo? I don't think so cause Jimbo says... We need a legal wall that keeps illegal aliens from earning any money to send back home. We have that now, brother. How's it workin'? Jim then said..... We need a legal wall to keep them from driving in the US. We have that now buddy. When they get caught they get a ticket or a bit of jail time. How's that working, Jim? As long as they are HERE they will drive. What's your plan for getting them to leave? Let's find out what Jim said next, shall we... We need a legal wall to deport criminals speedily so that their financial burden is shifted back to Mexico where it belongs. Well, what could possibly be faster than them volunteering. (Normally I'd capitalize that, but I'll try to give you credit for understanding its importance) OK, Jim give me another.... ""We need a legal wall top prevent anchor babies and payments to their parents being made out of our funds."" Again, if they've left the country on there own, where will the Anchor babies come from, Jim??? This is fun, what's Jim got for me now? We need a legal wall to pressure the Mexican government into discouraging instead of encouraging illegal border crossings. Not gonna happen brother. The money that comes back from here is the only reason they haven't risen up in revolt against the corrupt govt. Next..... ""We need a legal wall to allow guest workers to cross the border, report to authorities and go back to Mexico on a regular basis without citizenship and voting privileges."" Well, we've got that Jim. There are lots of guest worker programs. But do you really think most people will be willing to discuss this before the rest of the problems are sorted out? Hit me one more time........... ""We don't need a block wall like the Soviets used to squash freedoms within what used to be a perfectly beautiful city."" I too,wish it wasn't so. But I also live in the real world and anyway I think I addressed this earlier. And finally Jim closes with.... ""We don't need your petty, adhominem, adolescent attacks."" I believe it was you who started with how stupid I am and etc... in your first post in this thread and finished with me wanting to see my wife shot in the back, so I don't know what to tell ya on that one, buddy....
