The ability to get a single cash payment would not preclude their desire to continue to do so."" That's what the second half of the plan is, come forward and pay a penalty and serve a probation period and then get your green card. That's why I said there was something for both sides to hate (and why I think it would work .)","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","02:33 PM","government-debates","61"
"02-07-2008","10892",5,"sinjin","300661","I rarely encounter an illegal immigrant who has a job I would wish for my children. I live in Los Angeles btw. I've lived with Hispanic people my whole life. I wouldn't trade most for a hundred Ghost Riders. Even with all the #### they take from small-minded bigots their hearts are still full of kindness. Ghost Rider's ilk are so filled with hate that they'll never see it. Pity.","CUNxTime","300667","Well, as I said I'm married to one but I can say that I can understand G.R.'s fear of a culture war. A lot of what you see around, esp. the in your face attitude of some orgs. such as La Raza and etc.. Of course, you could say that's in response to other attacks on Latinos etc.. (which came first the chicken or the egg...) I'm not filled with hate, If I lived in a horrible place and couldn't take care of my family, I'd do the same thing. That's why it's hard to blame them. But there is something to be said of behaving a certain way when you are a guest. I know you mostly hear about the WORST examples and etc... But my wife gets calls all the time from illegals who know she's fluent in English and they ask her to help them fill out forms to get the EARNED INCOME CREDIT money for their children who are STILL IN MEXICO! There are plenty other examples I could give but you get the picture...","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","02:42 PM","government-debates","62"

The fact that we're tolerating IMs being in this country is showing how we're lax on crime and punishment and will put up with people breaking the law. We should be rounding these people up and charging them with violation of international laws (or whatever it is they've broken by jumping the border). There's also the fact that the friends and family of these guys are harming and killing our border patrol agents as they try and get across, and our boys can't do diddly against them because it's a violation and sparks some sort of international incident. Then we come to the annually proposed amnesty plan to give every single illegal mexican the chance of becoming a full US citizen without having to do ANY work whatsoever, and actually giving them opportunities to bring their famlies over!","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","07:29 PM","government-debates","70"

Starting forest fires along the border to facilitate getting across. Hospital emergency rooms and health clinics getting huge tax reimbursements for treating them, UNINSURED DRIVERS, 25 citizens killed every day by illegals (DUI, other accidents, murders), god knows how may rapes and child molestation, overburdened schools...

I'm not sure what the loophole is but I'd like to read the discussion....","Zardoz","300761","Here . Was a side discussion in economics about 3 days ago. It's not really a loophole but can be exploited if you know how to manipulate the system. For example, Mr and Mrs John Doe have 4+ kids and each make about 16K each. Not a whole lot. If they are 'married' and file together, they get a return on 32k with deductions. The EIC tops out at 2 kids. If they are seperated or not legally married or even divorced. They could file as such and claim 2 kids each...at the ~$16k figure...each claiming the 2 kid max for EIC. From the forms I'm looking at, that could net them close to 3* as much return in freebies (close to $10k total). Plus, being poor, they'd get all their FICA back or have a 0 liability. So, rather than truely rewarding the good ole fashioned nuclear family for the poor, the system rewards the seperation of such. This pretty much works only for large families...but, the sterotype of the Hispanic is often such. I'm sure you could sit down and figure out exactly what the perameters are for this. The jist of my arguement in the economics thread was to dispell the notion that illegals have to pay FICA and the only reason they do is often because of ignorance of how it works. Adding on to the premis that if the illegals were ever to file legal tax returns they'd be taking massive amounts of money out of the 'system' many supporters claim they put into. If they think pulling out medical and school 'resources' from the US system is bad, I wonder if they have thought about them giving 0 fica and taking $3k+ a year per adult from the pot too. I'm 100% in favor of increasing the numbers of legal immigrants here. An advanced worker visa program or similar would be okay. I'm NOT in favor of amnesty as most would become the above working poor and a further drain on the system.","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","11:33 PM","government-debates","72"
