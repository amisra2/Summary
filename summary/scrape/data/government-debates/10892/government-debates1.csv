However, in addition to being universally hated, I also happen to think that this plan for fixing the Illegal Immigration problem could actually work. First, to prevent the issue from having to be addressed again in the future, a border fence both physical and technological with patrols and monitors to prevent ingress from both above and below. After the fence is in place, an offer is made to those that are here in the country illegally. They can chose two options. 1. Volunteer to go back to their country of origin and they will receive a one time payment of $6000.00 per adult and $1500.00 for child. Many of them come here to save up this kind of money and it is their goal to leave after saving this anyway. 2. If they don't want to leave, they can register to stay provided they a. pay back taxes. b. pay a fine c. learn English and serve a probationary period to show they can support themselves and commit no crimes. I believe this will help address the problem of integration, prevent the US from spending scads of money in future entitlements and chain migration, bring people into the system and make them part of the economy and tax base.

All it would take to turn that country around is getting rid of their thoroughly corrupt, totally entrenched, government and this is the only way I see to accomplish that. If you pay them to leave, what's stopping them from taking the cash home, and then coming back for another payoff, or just coming back?","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","08:09 PM","government-debates","3"

Citizens to put up their property in order to get a vista to come here. If they don't go back when they are supposed to or they commit a crime the Mex. Govt. seizes the land or what ever and auction it off and give the proceeds to the US Gov. IF Caught Again, Also, the fence should help keep them out. Also, remember that there are going to be lots of people on the 'status probation'. If caught enabling illegals or harboring them or whatever they'll risk being sent back. Also, there will be 'status' rewards for turning people in non-compliers and BIG fines etc for businesses...","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","08:36 AM","government-debates","6"

Such a huge % of the population is DEMANDING a fence, no immigration plan will be accepted that doesn't involve one.
