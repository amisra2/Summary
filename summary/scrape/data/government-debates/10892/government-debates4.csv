That way all the dregs sink to the bottom, leaving the quality pieces up top. It's a nice way to maintain the status quo. And when I'm done, I can toss the left overs into a plastic bag and then that into a landfill near where the poor people live. Gotsta seal the bag up tight tho. Don't want the poor people smelling my left overs and rummaging through my trash.","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","10:22 AM","government-debates","46"

"02-06-2008","10892",4,"Ghost Rider","300457","I say forget giving the illegal mexicans any cash to take back with them. I say we supply them with sufficient weaponry, turn them back in their full 11 million forces, and let them start a revolt against their government that's dumped them on us to avoid a civil war revolution. Let them do what we've been unable to, raise against their government and right what went wrong!","Taxi Rob","300566","...I could go on with examples, but ultimately, it would be more effective in this day and age than our previous efforts, if that many would actually fight. The downside: The Mexicans threw off Spanish rule pretty handily, but didn't follow our evolutionary example closely enough in the modern era. What would happen after this revolution? Who would invest in the new Mexico besides the U.S.? Can we stop a civil war from dragging on indefinitely? Should we try? How would we deal with retribution and refugees? Similarly, what do you think is going to happen to Cuba after Castro? Will we have to accept Communist fugees? Should we jail them all? As for the ""melting pot,"" would someone please show me where it is written in the Constitution? I think the salad is a great analogy. After sitting in the fridge for a while, all the ingredients smell the same, and give themselves over to the same decay.","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","10:28 PM","government-debates","48"

Even now when the PRI wins the ENTIRE govt. bureaucracy is fired and replaced with the PRI's people when PAN wins the same thing. The people would never sacrifice for their country, pay taxes properly, or ever use most of the tax monies collect for necessary infrastructure improvements. They use it as there personal piggy bank, everyone complains until its their turn and BAM! same thing again. I'm not sure if they'll ever turn this behavior around but if they EVER do, it probably won't be within our lifetimes...","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","10:38 PM","government-debates","49"

Mostly just below 60%. Of course it matters where they come from.

I think a huge amount of people would opted to take advantage of it. The ones that decided to stay would have shown they truly want to be part of this country and the others could really help turn around the economies when they return home...

The ability to get a single cash payment would not preclude their desire to continue to do so. As for Ghost Rider and Sinjin, if you live close to the border, in a place with a high cost of living, and where good paying unskilled and semi-skilled jobs are scarce, you'd notice that illegals are taking skilled jobs as well as the ""jobs no Americans want,"" and because of the sheer numbers enforcement can't keep up, so you're both right, and you're both wrong. Distance from the border can significantly increase liberalism.","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","01:59 PM","government-debates","59"

I've lived with Hispanic people my whole life. I wouldn't trade most for a hundred Ghost Riders. Even with all the #### they take from small-minded bigots their hearts are still full of kindness. Ghost Rider's ilk are so filled with hate that they'll never see it. Pity.","my-immigration-plan-what-do-you-think","02:13 PM","government-debates","60"
