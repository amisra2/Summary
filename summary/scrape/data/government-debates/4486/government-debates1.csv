So here's an outsider's opinion based only on ""general knowledge"". As a broad generalisation, I would say that America is at least nominally a thoroughly Christian nation. Beyond the large number of Christian activists - a majority of which is supposed to have given Mr Bush his second term - there are, I would guess, a majority who would describe themselves as Christians: but whether this means that their lives are guided by strict Christian principles or that they take much notice of instructions from the clergy, is impossible to say. I suspect not. Christianity in America does not have the implacable character that, say, Islam does in other nations. With the possible exception of Ireland (and with the above qualifications), I think America is probably the most actively Christian nation in Western civilisation. On a minor point: the United States Treasury seems to be operating upon the assumption that Americans are Christians - if the ""In God We Trust"" slogan that appears on US currency refers only to the God of Christian people (and I believe it does).","christian-nation","03:53 AM","government-debates","2"

The vatican is a soverign state with monopoly on violence within its territorial boundaries (borders). You can be a citizen of the vatican without working for the church, the Vatican have their own coins, telecommunications, postal services, government, head of state (the pope), diplomats, flag, official language, courts, laws etc, etc. The Vatican is only a half a squarekilometer and has a population of mere 900, but I don`t see why it shouldn`t count as a state?","christian-nation","09:40 AM","government-debates","6"

Nationality is more than mere residence within certain prescribed boundaries - it includes the sharing of a particular social and cultural heritage etc. To claim that the Vatican is a ""nation"" can only be argued on the basis of a very elastic definition of the concept of ""nationality"".","christian-nation","09:58 AM","government-debates","7"

And of course, your version of christianity is the TROO (tm) version of christianity. Everyone else is wrong. Because you know the TROO (tm) version of christianity and are willing to condemn anyone with whom you disagree. It must be TROO christianity since I see so many christians who are willing to do so. Isn't it funny how often a remark like ""I'm not one to judge, but..."" is followed by judgement. It must be one of the tenets of TROO christianity. Actually, the largest single religious demonination in the U.S. is Roman Catholicism. The Protestant sects are so fractured the any single one is almost insignificant. I think that the Southern Baptists are second - the TROO christian sect that was formed after the Civil War so that Catholics, Jews, and blacks could be discriminated against. Of course, the KKK had its roots among the Southern Baptists. Its funny too, since the Baptists of colonial times were persecuted by other christian sects. The Baptists actually supported the adoption of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights that was officially opposed by most christian sects. For example, Patrick Henry in Virginia led the opposition to both in the Virginia legislature, and in fact had introduced a bill to levy a tax on all citizens in order to pay ministers of the state religion - Episcopaleanism. James Madison was primarily responsible for the defeat of Henry's bill (see Memorial and Remonstrance ) and then introduced a bill (originally written by Jefferson) that abolished the state religion and established freedom of religion in Virginia (see The Virginia Act For Establishing Religious Freedom ) And christians hold Henry up as an example as an example of a ""founding father"" to be admired. Funny that Henry had no part in writing the Articles of Confederation, the Constitution, or the Bill of Rights. He did favor a rebellion against the Crown some 20 years earlier, but that actually had nothing to do with the founding of the country. It seems that when a christian claims to be in favor of liberty and freedom it means that they are in favor of having the liberty and freedom to impose their religion on everyone by force of law.","christian-nation","10:09 AM","government-debates","8"
"03-10-2005","4486",1,"None","None","None","Eddie","96755","@ Alan Ah, yes, this is true. One could make an argument that the Vatican is merely a state within the nation of Italy. Allthough I suspect that there are real cultural difference as well between the average vatican citizen and the average italian citizen. First we have the level of faith, which is undoubtedly higher in the Vatican. Secondly, the papal state (or church state) has a long history of an political independancy. Once as large as the entire central italy, it has since shrinked into the tiny territory inside the city of rome (1861 is the exact date of this ""shrinkage""). Thridly, the papal state has latin as one of their official languages (italian being the second). In addition, the Vatican also produces its own media. It is indeed a question as to what constitutes as a nation, but I`m inclined to say that the Vatican has their own nation, distict from the italian nation. Allthough not as pronounced as say Mexico and the US. But perhaps close to the distinction between Sweden and Norway.","christian-nation","10:09 AM","government-debates","9"

On the next question of whether the country should affirm any religion : I assume that you are not talking about a statutory affirmation, so what is meant by ""the country"" is a collection of individuals who have the freedom to affirm or to deny Christianity or religion in general as they see fit. I don't think there are many who would want to go further than say people have a ""right"" to follow the religion of their choice - but there is no corresponding duty of the state to give religion (any religion) an authority in civil affairs.","christian-nation","11:11 AM","government-debates","13"
"03-10-2005","4486",1,"None","None","None","pandion","96918","My first inclination was to ask for clarification. Does the question ask about whether many or most citizens of the U.S. are Christians, or is the question about whether our government is somehow based on or is it motivated by Christian principles. It seems that the question is more like the latter, only should the United States affirm Christianity or religion in general. Well, the writers of the Constitution were well aware of the religious wars among Christians in Europe. It was quite evident that when religion became a function of government, that it became more and more imporant which particular sect was considered the ""correct"" true religion. Even the writers of the Constitution held several different faiths, depending on from which state they came. They were very aware of the religious persecutions that were carried out in the American colonies. They realized the problems that would arise in trying to form a strong federal government that recognized a single state religion - which one? So they avoided the issue by forming a government that said nothing about religion and didn't mention God. The authority of the Constitution was derived from ""We the people...,"" and not from divine authority or holy scripture. In fact, the Godlessness of the Constitution was one of the reasons that the Constitution was openly opposed by most Christian churches, with the exception of the Baptists who realized that a government formed without a religious basis would be to their benefit - no federal taxes to finance religions that persecuted them. In these debates, those who claim that the U.S. was founded on Christian principles always point to the Declaration of Independence. They see their religion in the expressions used there, usually because they are willing to distort the meaning of the text. For example, in the first paragraph, Jefferson used the word ""God."" However, in context it is clear that he was not refering to the Christian God. Jefferson declares that events have made it necessary for the people to assume a separate and equal station among the powers of earth and that it is the ""Laws of Nature and of Nature's God"" that entitle them to this separation. Such references to nature were common in humanist writing and ""God"" is given second billing, being subject to the same laws that control nature. Also note that it is a respect to the opinions of mankind that motivates the declaration, not a duty to any god. In the next paragraph, Jefferson stated certain unalienable rights. Beyond the fact that the rights were considered to be self evident (not a matter of revelation by scripture), unalienable rights are not principles of Christianity anywhere. Individual rights have always been considered subject to the needs of the church. And of course, the statement of the equality of all men is intended as a direct response to the Christian idea that someone is, ""by the Grace of God, King."" And of course, governments derive their powers from the consent of the governed, not from anyone's god, and the governed retain the right to change that government. But all of the above discussion is actually moot. The Declaration is not a founding document of this country. It is what it says it is, and nothing more - a declaration. Our first government was actually founded the the Articles of Confederation. When this government was recognized to be inadequate to the future needs of the country, the Continental Congress made itself the Constitutional Convention and assigned itself the task of writing a new Constitution. But even the ""Christian nation"" advocates are aware that God is not mentioned once in the Constitution. Instead it is ""We the People"" who ""ordain and establish"" the Constitution. Including the Bill of Rights, Jesus and God are not mentioned once, and religion is mentioned twice, both times in the form of prohibitions. So no, the United States is not a Christian nation. There is also the matter of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the United States and the Bey and Subjects of Tripoli of Barbary (known as the Treaty of Tripoli). This treaty was negotiated and written by Joel Barlow during Washington's 2nd term. Barlow had previously been appointed as Chaplain of the Continental Army by Washington. The treaty was approved by the Senate without a single dissenting vote and signed by President Adams. You may see some discussion that article 11 is not included in the Arabic version of this document and that that fact is somehow telling. However, the version ratified by the Senate and signed by Adams said the following: ""As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion;"" Keep in mind that the year was 1797 - the country was just over 8 years old. One might think that the Senate would be well aware of the intent of the founding fathers, especially since some of them were the founding fathers.","christian-nation","05:18 PM","government-debates","14"
