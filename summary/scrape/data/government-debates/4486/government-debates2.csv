It was something sooo useful and yet sooo obscure I never thought anyone would know about it.","christian-nation","11:01 AM","government-debates","16"

I think that most people who have been involved in the church/state separation debate for any length of time are aware of the treaty. But of course, the ""christian nation"" people don't think that article 11 means what it says. In fact, I mentioned one argument that ""christian nation"" advocates have put forward. I have seen it claimed that the article wasn't in the original (Arabic) version signed by Barlow and representatives of the Bey, but was added during translation. But that doesn't hold water. Article 11 was in the version passed by the Senate and signed by Adams.","christian-nation","12:15 PM","government-debates","17"
