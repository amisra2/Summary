As much as I have supreme umbrage with most of what Bush's mob does, it's really a large jump from fascism no matter what people scream. Still, an interesting article, even if I don't put much store in it.","fascist-america-10-easy-steps","06:51 PM","government-debates","2"

Of course, last time I admitted that, I was giving a hug to a gay kid in a book store to cheer him up some because his female friend was lambasting Dungeons and Dragons. I guess being a fascist is bad. No more supporting homosexuals having a bad day for me.","fascist-america-10-easy-steps","11:26 PM","government-debates","4"

Benito Mussolini, the grand daddy of fascism, called fascism ""corporatism"", a merger of corporations and the state. When I look at our western societies I'd say we're pretty damn close right now.","fascist-america-10-easy-steps","09:08 AM","government-debates","5"

But the key element of fascism was the intrusion of the state in all levels of human affairs to the extent of practically removing the wall between private and public life. An Orwellian dystopia is what fascism aims to achieve. All governments try to extend their power and control over those they govern. The only protection for individuals is the separation and independence of the branches of government, a free independent media and last but not least a democratic system. The price to pay to protect individual liberties against the state is eternal vigilance","fascist-america-10-easy-steps","08:44 AM","government-debates","7"
"03-30-2008","9901",1,"None","None","None","scarletdaisies","306997","I think they are near their goal and most people are falling into the paranoid dillusion that it's because of protection. How much protection do you think the government has to do for you? Most people won't even own a gun. How can anyone protect people that won't protect themselves? I think people are so soft that they are burying their country by not preventing what is going on. Have you ever seen the old Clint Eastwood movie I think called ""Hell"". A man is beat to death and the community is too scared to break it up, so his spirit comes back and make them learn to fight for themselves again to get rid of a coupe on the community. That is going to be the U.S. if people get any softer. They want to be hard about social areas harassing each other and competing with each other, but what about real life? If you don't vote, sign petitions, get involved to protect your rights, you are going to lose them. You may not believe in owning hand guns, but do you believe people like Blackwater should own them for you? I surely don't feel any safer and it would cost much less money to take care of it myself. I wish people would wake up and do something for themselves.","fascist-america-10-easy-steps","03:07 AM","government-debates","8"

I do not like guns and will not own one but that does not mean that I do not know how to use a stick, fire poker, or shovel to hit some one with or that I am not willing to use them. People do get involved voting, and signing petitions. In fact the petition process has been used to take my civil rights away, make my family second class, and force me to live by someone elses religious beliefs.","fascist-america-10-easy-steps","08:24 AM","government-debates","9"
"03-30-2008","9901",1,"None","None","None","scarletdaisies","307059","In some cities, you cannot not only own a gun, but you are in martial law. In Washignton D.C and Boston they are doing voluntary door to door searches. The police are actally going door to door to ask if they can search homes. Some disregard it being it takes permission to go in, but that is a strong form of coercement making people scared, so they are going to give in. That is the most disgusting thing a government should allow, even with permission and opens doors to other big-brother things. If we don't say no to these things and fall for their overly strict supposed security measures, we will have no rights what so ever. It does seem they attack the middle man, but people don't get involved. They complain behind everyone's back about it, and then put up with it when they could have stopped it. They are hippocrits.","fascist-america-10-easy-steps","08:04 PM","government-debates","10"
