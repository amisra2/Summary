A representational legislature is capable of making any decision worth making, leaving things that are obviously local matters to the States. It is still subject to scrutiny. Im not advocating giving all the power just to the President, but I dont see the problem in big government. I don't really see why incoherency between States is such a desired thing. Take the death penalty for example. I don't understand how one State can have it or another not. Something like that is either considered just punishment or morally unacceptable. Such elements shouldn't change depending on what post code you're in. Apologies, I use the language I'm used to, hence not using the word 'federal' as we're not a federation. Still, I understand that the US government was created in that way, but that's not why it should be. That's just saying 'we've got to do it that way coz the constitution says so'...","nate895","290354","We do have to do it because the Constitution says so, otherwise why would we have written it. If you want to change our form of government, get a constitutional amendment, you can't impose your will upon everyone because it is your personal opinion. If you look at most states, on the vast majority of issues, the people of those states agree upon many things that the entire country is evenly divided upon. Take gay marriage, in most states there is an overwhelming majority of people who oppose it, but in a few states the supporters outnumber those who oppose by a lot. Overall a federalist system puts things that are of national importance that no state can do alone, in the hands of the Feds, while the controversial issues stay in the place of power where they'll cause the least dissension. If one side on many issues was able to get the upper hand in the majority of the Union, and imposes their will upon the minority then this might lead to conflict and if the issue is important enough, it leads to war. P.S. When representatives from a certain portion of the Union heavily outnumber those from another, they can use that portion of the Union as basically a revenue maker or whatever there experiment of the day is.","return-constitutional-government","09:36 PM","government-debates","8"

If you don't know what the ""New Deal"" and ""Great Society"" are then you are pretty ignorant of American History. Just because you think holding the Union together is the Feds responsibility doesn't make it so. The National Guard has taken the place of a well-regulated militia because the Feds are scared of what that would mean. If every male between 17 and 45 (the definition of the militia) knew how to fight then the feds (especially the courts) then wouldn't be able to make any law they want. Where does it say in the Constitution that because something is considered good by socialist wack-jobs then they can override it. If you want to override the Constitution, get enough states to call a new constitutional convention, then send out the new constitution to the states for ratification, and if not enough ratify, you've lost. If enough do, but not all then the rest are not in the Union any more. There you've got yourself a way to ""win."" Where does it say that the Federal government can make alliances, it can make treaties, but not join any body such as an alliance.

As Winston Churchill said Slavery was made legal in all the colonies, but we ended slavery with a constitutional amendment. Like I have said, if you want a legitimate change of government you can do any one the following things; (1) amend the constitution if wish the union to stay whole with all the states staying within it, (2) call a new constitutional convention and have the new constitution ratified in the same manner as our last one, (3) if your state doesn't like any of those options call a convention and adopt an ordinance of secession, I assure you that the American people will not have the stomach for a fight, and if they do, I'll fight right alongside you. I am advocating Democracy at the state level, as our nation is too large to have the central government handle the issues not enumerated in our constitution or given by the several amendments. If the central government handles the powers I think you are suggesting then it might lead to disunion, as many around the country, whether you know or not are willing to fight against such usurpations. Segregation is obviously against the constitution, therefore a state can't make a law it has agreed it can't make. P.S.

If a straight couple cannot have children due to extenuating circumstances, they can adopt or now have a fertilization. The purpose is to have children, that is what I meant by family. Whatever In certain states, there is something called no-fault divorce where the reason doesn't matter. In other circumstances something might be of important family value that should stay in the family of that spouse, so they get it and that is taken out of the equation. Other things might be legitimately of importance to one party and of no interest to the other, those are also taken out of the equation.

Power would be stronger in the states, and act more like a union of nations as we are actually described as that even by the name ""United States of America"" can be loosely translated to ""Union of Countries in the Continent of America"". We have states because people with differing values understood that they needed a place for themselves to practice what they believe apart from others rather than impose beliefs as a centralized country which is exactly what they ran away from and formed a country to combat in the first place. We are a country because we are a formidable force as such. Originally we were an political alloy of beliefs combining to become one of the strongest and most diverse systems of government that had ever been devised. Now we are seeing the advent of centralization and our federation of states is becoming a singular entity. The democratic and republican forms of government are flawed in that they give favor to what is popular and not what is right. It takes several men to do good and only a few to destroy what good has been done. When you only have a few that want to do good and several that want to destroy that good then you have disaster. It's our achilles' heel, if you will. If one country in a federation fails, the federation will continue. If we are truly just a singular country and we fail, then the whole thing is gone. As power is concentrated, decisions are made faster and more efficiently, thus the pursuit of a more centralized government for the United States is born. The only issue is that few are in charge of the well-being of many and small mistakes are turned into massive ones. The sum of the parts is not as great as the whole, but there is a very striking difference between a Union or Federation and a Country.
