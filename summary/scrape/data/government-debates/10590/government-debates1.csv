Centralized government means a concentration of power in the hands of a few people.

"11-09-2007","10590",1,"Phunting","290342","I don't think that's necessarily true. A representational legislature is capable of making any decision worth making, leaving things that are obviously local matters to the States. It is still subject to scrutiny. Im not advocating giving all the power just to the President, but I dont see the problem in big government. I don't really see why incoherency between States is such a desired thing. Take the death penalty for example. I don't understand how one State can have it or another not. Something like that is either considered just punishment or morally unacceptable. Such elements shouldn't change depending on what post code you're in. Apologies, I use the language I'm used to, hence not using the word 'federal' as we're not a federation. Still, I understand that the US government was created in that way, but that's not why it should be. That's just saying 'we've got to do it that way coz the constitution says so'...","nate895","290354","We do have to do it because the Constitution says so, otherwise why would we have written it. If you want to change our form of government, get a constitutional amendment, you can't impose your will upon everyone because it is your personal opinion. If you look at most states, on the vast majority of issues, the people of those states agree upon many things that the entire country is evenly divided upon. Take gay marriage, in most states there is an overwhelming majority of people who oppose it, but in a few states the supporters outnumber those who oppose by a lot. Overall a federalist system puts things that are of national importance that no state can do alone, in the hands of the Feds, while the controversial issues stay in the place of power where they'll cause the least dissension. If one side on many issues was able to get the upper hand in the majority of the Union, and imposes their will upon the minority then this might lead to conflict and if the issue is important enough, it leads to war. P.S. When representatives from a certain portion of the Union heavily outnumber those from another, they can use that portion of the Union as basically a revenue maker or whatever there experiment of the day is.","return-constitutional-government","09:36 PM","government-debates","8"

Would you say that Oklahoma has a right to say to couples that are just traveling through that their adopted child is not their adopted child because the child was adopted in another state? Because Oklahoma has just such a law. Do you think that Virginia has a right to invalidate my power of attorney if when visiting the state and something happens that I need medical attention? Because Virginia has just such a law. No idea what you mean by this. This is not specific. Again not specific. What does the civil war have to do with anything. I do believe that it is the federal governments responsiblity to keep the union together. Again nothing specific could you give some examples. OK something specific. I don't see a problem with this and the national gaurd is under the control of the governors of the various states. Again nothing specific but I will take a shot at this as I think I understand what you mean. What is pork barrel spending if it isn't individual congress people getting money for their state and local area that they represent. Which is exactly opposite of the arguement you are trying to make, they are looking after the intrests of the local people. Again why this is a bad thing? As a socialist I believe that it is the responsiblity of the federal government to take care of the people. Do you want people to die in the homeless in the streets ravshied by the excesses of capitalism? It is that capitalisic excesses that has, in every case, led to each expansion of power by the federal government. Take the banking mess of the 1930's it was created by speculators. The federal government stepped in to protect the people. Are you saying that FDIC is a bad idea? Are you saying that you approve of the banks using your money to play the stock market then go under leaving you with no money? This is exactly the power set up by the constitution.

If you don't know what the ""New Deal"" and ""Great Society"" are then you are pretty ignorant of American History. Just because you think holding the Union together is the Feds responsibility doesn't make it so. The National Guard has taken the place of a well-regulated militia because the Feds are scared of what that would mean. If every male between 17 and 45 (the definition of the militia) knew how to fight then the feds (especially the courts) then wouldn't be able to make any law they want. Where does it say in the Constitution that because something is considered good by socialist wack-jobs then they can override it. If you want to override the Constitution, get enough states to call a new constitutional convention, then send out the new constitution to the states for ratification, and if not enough ratify, you've lost. If enough do, but not all then the rest are not in the Union any more. There you've got yourself a way to ""win."" Where does it say that the Federal government can make alliances, it can make treaties, but not join any body such as an alliance. As far as discrimination is concerned, the 13th and 15th amendment made it the Feds responsibility, and I'm fine with them enforcing the powers they've been delegated, though nothing more.","return-constitutional-government","02:36 PM","government-debates","12"

So slavery must have been fine, else why would people have made it legal? I'm not trying to change anyone's government, I'm just saying that 'because it is' is no reason on it's own for keeping something so.

It was written by humans; just as fallible, bigoted and flawed as the rest of us. Perhaps I overstated. I do understand that many things can and should be regulated on a state level. But I see many things as inherent rights that should be decided nationally.

As Winston Churchill said Slavery was made legal in all the colonies, but we ended slavery with a constitutional amendment. Like I have said, if you want a legitimate change of government you can do any one the following things; (1) amend the constitution if wish the union to stay whole with all the states staying within it, (2) call a new constitutional convention and have the new constitution ratified in the same manner as our last one, (3) if your state doesn't like any of those options call a convention and adopt an ordinance of secession, I assure you that the American people will not have the stomach for a fight, and if they do, I'll fight right alongside you. I am advocating Democracy at the state level, as our nation is too large to have the central government handle the issues not enumerated in our constitution or given by the several amendments. If the central government handles the powers I think you are suggesting then it might lead to disunion, as many around the country, whether you know or not are willing to fight against such usurpations. Segregation is obviously against the constitution, therefore a state can't make a law it has agreed it can't make. P.S. As a curiosity, could you please enumerate the powers you desire the feds to have, and not vague like ""protecting rights"" if you desire something of that nature please enumerate those rights.","return-constitutional-government","12:21 AM","government-debates","15"
