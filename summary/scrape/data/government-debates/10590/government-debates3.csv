In any event, we have obviously gone away from the original understanding of the constitution. This is not even disputed by the constitutional scholars. This dispute is whether or not this is ok. As for the federal government being a bad thing, I agree and for some of the reasons already said. A large federal government is bad because they get disconnected from the people. There is little doubt that someone in New York is different (in culture) from someone in Texas. Because of this it is better for them to govern themselves and not make blanket rules for all. If you have local governments you are more in touch with the people and you better reflect how each wishes to be governed. Even in business a decentralized structure is preferred.","return-constitutional-government","11:00 PM","government-debates","31"

"11-14-2007","10590",3,"obvious_child","290618","Are you saying that Pagan marriage did not exist? Also are you saying that pagan societies did not exist prior to the Egyptians and Babylonians? Marriage started off as a joining of two people and their incorporeal essences. That is unless you don't believe that Pagan societies existed before the civilizations you mentioned... I take it you are a creationist and believe in a 6,000 year old world?","peteratwar","290646","Last sentence, you couldn't be more wrong. You should have read other posts. Of course Pagan Societies existed what of it ? Over the millenia it has become more formalised within Society whereby the marriage status received various benefits from the Society. Hence the interest Society has in what makes a marriage. Marriage has always been a contract betweentwo parties (man and woman) acknowledged as such by the society in which they live","return-constitutional-government","02:30 AM","government-debates","33"

This done by abusing the Constitutional laws and I agree. Our constitution is at the risk of being ripped completely out by the hands of the Bush administration. They are coercing people into allowing illegal searches for guns in Washington D.C. and Boston and before long it will be in every state until something is done about it. This I beleive was done out of retribution because the gun ban was lifted from Washington. This mayor also keeps doing some kind of martial law curfew.","return-constitutional-government","02:54 AM","government-debates","34"

No rebellion, no invasion = no suspension of Habeas Corpus. The righties got just what they have been screaming for all these years, a Court which interprets the law instead of making it. Seems like the dissenters were the ones lusting after a results oriented decision. Why aren't they jumping for joy? They got just what they wished for.

Just note, for example, Chester's relentless use of class suprematist terminology.

Power would be stronger in the states, and act more like a union of nations as we are actually described as that even by the name ""United States of America"" can be loosely translated to ""Union of Countries in the Continent of America"". We have states because people with differing values understood that they needed a place for themselves to practice what they believe apart from others rather than impose beliefs as a centralized country which is exactly what they ran away from and formed a country to combat in the first place. We are a country because we are a formidable force as such. Originally we were an political alloy of beliefs combining to become one of the strongest and most diverse systems of government that had ever been devised. Now we are seeing the advent of centralization and our federation of states is becoming a singular entity. The democratic and republican forms of government are flawed in that they give favor to what is popular and not what is right. It takes several men to do good and only a few to destroy what good has been done. When you only have a few that want to do good and several that want to destroy that good then you have disaster. It's our achilles' heel, if you will. If one country in a federation fails, the federation will continue. If we are truly just a singular country and we fail, then the whole thing is gone. As power is concentrated, decisions are made faster and more efficiently, thus the pursuit of a more centralized government for the United States is born. The only issue is that few are in charge of the well-being of many and small mistakes are turned into massive ones. The sum of the parts is not as great as the whole, but there is a very striking difference between a Union or Federation and a Country. A balance must be maintained, and if it fails then we have nothing to fear from other countries that wish ill will upon the United States for we have destroyed ourselves from within.","return-constitutional-government","05:42 PM","government-debates","41"
