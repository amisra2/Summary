But the way it's interpreted now, the 14th ammendment means, in effect, that the states also cannot establish religion. If there was originally meant to be a true seperation of church and state, then the establishment clause would have read more like the other ammendments in the bill of rights. For instance, the 4th ammendment: ""The right of the people... shall not be violated..."" If there was originally intended to be a solid seperation of church and state then the establishment clause would have read something more like: ""The right to free exercise of religion shall not be abrigded...""","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","02:50 PM","government-debates","13"

Laws must have a secular purpose, they can't be solely religious. That's what I meant when I said that religion can't mess with government. Clearly the seperation wasn't meant to be absolute, any more than freedom of speech means you can yell fire in a theater, or the right to bear arms means you can own a nuke. Common sense still applies; you can't kill someone and say that your religion demands human sacrifice, for example.

Don't subscribe to cable if you don't like what's on there. Absolutely nothing you describe prevents you from following your religion in the way that you wish. It only means that others aren't living their lives in the way that you would wish. And that's the way it should be. Just as no one should tell you to stop acting the way you feel your religion requires, you shouldn't expect people to live a certain way, based on your beliefs. People may not be following your religious standards, but that isn't an attack on Christianity. As long as you personally can follow your religion then talk of an anti-christian movement is just scare tactics. There's no liberal conspiracy to make people think those words are in the Constitution! That's just silliness. The concept is in there, that's clear.

And the government is then required to say no, also due to the first amendment. What about them? You were saying that laws are based on morals, and are therefore religious and not secular. I gave a counter example to show that your claim was incorrect. The fact that some laws, like no booze on sunday, do have a religious basis just shows that the system is imperfect and things slip through, not that laws aren't or shouldn't be secular. I agree that there is an underlying morallity. However, I don't belive, as you seem to imply, that religion provides that morallity. Rather I think that religions have tapped into and codified that morality. The principle came first, and religions adopted it. And what is this basic moral principle? Simply put, things that hurt people are bad and things that help people are good. Vastly oversimplified of course, and with lots of room for discussion, but I believe that that is the esssence of any succesful moral system, including the religious ones. So to use your first example, why does the medical code of ethics strictly regulate human experimentation? Not because God told them to do it that way, but because they want to insure as much as possible that they do more good than harm. The risk of harm to the individuals being experimented on must be outweighed by the good the experiments are expected to do.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","12:58 PM","government-debates","31"

After the 14th amendment was passed, section 5 only applied to the provisions of the 14th amendment: namely equal protection, etc. Since the 14th amendment concerned the duties of states, and Congress was explicitly given authority to enforce the provisions of the 14th amendment, this was a backdoor for Congress to have absolute authority over the states.

The Kansas Board of Education voting, today, to diminish the role of evolution in the state's science curriculum. The ballot in preliminary, the board expected to make its final decision in the next couple of months. This is round two for the state of Kansas and about round 102 for the country. But unlike prior battles, strict biblical creationism barely gets a mention. Instead, even though critics call it a way of dressing God up in a lab coat , opponents of evolution say they're fighting science with science. Here's CNN's Ed Lavendera. ED LAVENDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The battle over how to teach science is erupting in Kansas. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Leave the room, sir. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not going to leave the room. LAVENDERA: It's the latest fight to bring the theory of intelligent design to a classroom near you. The Kansas State Board of Education is considering new science curriculum standards that offer a more critical view of evolution. Supporters don't understand why many scientists aren't open to this debate. JOHN CALVERT, INTELLIGENT DESIGN SUPPORTER: They also are favoring a set of standards that do not allow or comprehend criticisms of evolution. LAVENDERA: Many teachers are angry to see what they call bad science make it into the classroom. STEVEN CASE, INTELLIGENT DESIGN OPPONENT: Those are inappropriate changes. Some for educational reasons, some for scientific reasons. LAVENDERA: Intelligent design, or I.D., as it's often called, is the idea that the universe is so complicated that some things cannot be explained by science alone, that there must be some intelligent source behind the world's creation. Intelligent design theory does not say God is responsible, that's where it differs from creationism. But skeptics say intelligent design simply disguises religion in a shroud of science. Critics often call it science fiction. STEPHEN MEYER, DISCOVERY INSTITUTE: If we put intelligent design into our biology textbooks, based on the misrepresentation of real scientific fact and the conjecture that its proponents rely on, then we may as well add the study of flying saucers and aliens from outer space to our biology and physics books. LAVENDERA: A recent Harris Interactive poll found 64 percent of Americans believe in creationism, that human beings were created directly by God. 22 percent believe in the theory of evolution. And 10 percent support intelligent design. But when it comes to the question facing hundreds of school districts around the country, 55 percent of Americans believe all three ideas should be taught in school together. Intelligent design even has President Bush's support. He says it should be taught in schools along with evolution. Supporters argue intelligent design is a legitimate science worthy of debate as an alternative to what they see as the flawed theory of evolution. JOHN COURAGE, HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE TEACHER: We've had 150 years of one dogma ruling biology. What we're asking for is that Darwinian evolution be taught to students, but also the current scientific criticisms of the theory. LAVENDERA: Like the proverbial elephant in the room, intelligent design is roaming through classrooms and school board meetings around the country. Everyone knows it's there, but many scientists still don't want to talk to it, for fear of giving it too much credibility. But it appears intelligent design may might already be gaining in the war of acceptance.","gnojek","154450","Jesus TF Christ, you are really freaking me out right now.

It is impossible to build sound constitutional doctrine upon a mistaken understanding of constitutional history, expresssly freighted with Jefferson's misleading metaphor for nearly forty years. Thomas Jefferson was of course in France at the time the constitutional amendments known as the Bill of Rights were pressed by Congress and ratified by the States. His letter to the Danbury Baptist Association was a short note of courtesy, written fourteen years after the amendments were passed by Congress. He would seem to any detached observer as a less than ideal source of contemporary history to the meaning of the Religious Clauses of the first Amendment. The Establishment Clause did not require government neutrality between religion and irreligion nor did it prohibit the Federal Government from providing nondiscriminatory aid to religion. There is simply no historical foundation for the proposition that the Framers intneded to build the ""wall of seperation""..... ....The ""wall of seperation between church and State"" is a metaphor based on bad history, a metaphor which has proved useless as a guide to judging. It should be frankly and explicitly be abandoned. [since 1947] our Establishment Clause cases have been neither principaled nor unified.

They laid the groundwork, or the ""cornerstone,"" if you will, for our nation and, bad or good, it still stands. As does the fraternity. There's a lesson in there somewhere's. Add religion to any institution and havoc will follow. Harmony and strength are the support of all institutions, more especially of ours. That is why it is so important to keep religion at arms length and never take your eye off of it. It can be deadlier than a tornado. Whereas it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his protection and favor-- and whereas both Houses of Congress have by their joint Committee requested me to recommend to the People of the United States a day of public thanksgiving and prayer to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many signal favors of Almighty God especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for their safety and happiness. Now therefore I do recommend and assign Thursday the 26th day of November next to be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be-- That we may then all unite in rendering unto him our sincere and humble thanks--for his kind care and protection of the People of this Country previous to their becoming a Nation--for the signal and manifold mercies, and the favorable interpositions of his Providence which we experienced in the course and conclusion of the late war--for the great degree of tranquility, union, and plenty, which we have since enjoyed--for the peaceable and rational manner, in which we have been enabled to establish constitutions of government for our safety and happiness, and particularly the national One now lately instituted--for the civil and religious liberty with which we are blessed; and the means we have of acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge; and in general for all the great and various favors which he hath been pleased to confer upon us. and also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations and beseech him to pardon our national and other transgressions-- to enable us all, whether in public or private stations, to perform our several and relative duties properly and punctually--to render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed--to protect and guide all Sovereigns and Nations (especially such as have shewn kindness unto us) and to bless them with good government, peace, and concord--To promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue, and the encrease of science among them and us--and generally to grant unto all Mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as he alone knows to be best.

So why teach that animal X evolved into animals Y & Z when we can't actually show that this occurred? Evolution teaches a conclusion, this is the evidence, and this is a rational extrapolation of the evidence. But that's not what anti-creationists want to teach, they just want to teach the conclusion without demonstrating the evidence or the fact that the theory itself is an extrapolation of evidence.

The main gaping hole is this; Untill about the time of Einstein, Athiests could comfort themselves with the belief that the universe is eternal, and thus did not need a cause. But since then, five lines of scientific evidence have been discovered that prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the universe did indeed have a beginning. Science has proven, by it's own methods, that the world began abruptly in an act of creation to which you can trace the seeds of every star, every planet, every living thing in this cosmos and on the earth. And it has found that all this happened as a product of forces that man cannot hope to discover - supernatural forces. It takes every bit as much faith to be an evolutionist as it does to be a creationist. I agree. Interpretation is the problem. The Supreme Court is supposed to do it, and more and more of the general public seems to think they're doing a pretty lousy job of it. Atheism is arguably a religion. As I showed above, science can't hope to prove that the universe began without a supernatural creator. Why should their assumption that there is no creator be taught as fact, with no other (at least equal) assumptions not be permitted to be taught in our schools? What kind of a question is that? I didn't admit to not understanding it, I questioned his understanding of it. Even if I didn't understand something, chances are I'd know where it wasn't.

The first is that we need to be able to distinguish Christian values, or any relgion's for that matter, from what you might call generic values. Simply because something appears in the BIble does not make it Christian, or at least not exclusively Christian. Some version of ""Thou shall not kill"" is found in most religions, and in most cultures. It's a basic tenant of any moral structure, and so does not ""belong"" to Christianity. And therefore having laws against killing in no way should be construed as endorsing a religious creedo. If you tried to have a law saying that you couldn't eat red meat on Friday, that would be a religious law. The second point you bring up concerns the government coercing people's religious choices. You speak of laws and arrests, and seem to suggest that their lack is sufficient to ensure freedom of religion. I would disagree. For people to really have religious freedom, they must believe that they have religious freedom. As a hypothetical example, if a government says you have religious freedom, but social services in an area where people of religion A lived were always better then in the religion B neighborhoods, and religion B people always seemed to lose in court, and religion A holidays were state holidays, but none of religion B, then you couldn't really say that there was religious freedom, right? There's definite pressure to be of religion A, even if there's no laws to that effect. This sort of thing has happened often enought throughout history that people are right to be concerned about it. And so it's not enough for our government to simply not pressure people, it's their responsibility to not give the appearance of pressuring people. And having a big old plaque in the middle of the courthouse saying ""worship this God and no other"" most definately gives the impression of pressure. It may not be forcing people by law to become Christians, but it does give the impression that the government prefers Judeo/Christianity, and if the people believe that the government is biased towards one religion then they won't feel as free to follow another.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","01:18 PM","government-debates","79"

""Believing that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should make no law 'respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between church and state."" (President Thomas Jefferson, 1802 letter to the Baptists of Danbury, Connecticut) Because religious belief, or non-belief, is such an important part of every person's life, freedom of religion affects every individual. State churches that use government power to support themselves and force their views on persons of other faiths undermine all our civil rights. Moreover, state support of the church tends to make the clergy unresponsive to the people and leads to corruption within religion. Erecting the ""wall of separation between church and state,"" therefore, is absolutely essential in a free society. We have solved ... the great and interesting question whether freedom of religion is compatible with order in government and obedience to the laws. And we have experienced the quiet as well as the comfort which results from leaving every one to profess freely and openly those principles of religion which are the inductions of his own reason and the serious convictions of his own inquiries. (Thomas Jefferson, to the Virginia Baptists, 1808) This is his second use of the term ""wall of separation,"" here quoting his own use in the Danbury Baptist letter. This wording was several times upheld by the Supreme Court as an accurate description of the Establishment Clause: Reynolds (98 U.S. at 164, 1879); Everson (330 U.S. at 59, 1947); McCollum (333 U.S. at 232, 1948) http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/jefframe.htm The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg. -- Thomas Jefferson, Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781-82 http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/jefframe.htm [N]o man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities. -- Thomas Jefferson, Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom (1779), quoted from Merrill D. Peterson, ed., Thomas Jefferson: Writings (1984), p. 347 http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/jefframe.htm Our civil rights have no dependence upon our religious opinions more than our opinions in physics or geometry. -- Thomas Jefferson, Statute for Religious Freedom, 1779.

"08-21-2005","6149",6,"DamEtel","None","Wrong. It was an explanation of the establishment clause, helping to clarify its intent. Gee, now do you think that that might be why the Supreme Court has used Jefferson's statements about building a wall of separation between church and state as their means of understanding the intent of the establishment clause? Huh? And if you'll note, again, Jefferson repeated his phrase ""wall of separation between church and state"" in another letter to a religious group to help explain the intent. Now, is there anything else about the Constitution that helps confirm that it's a secular document, meant to separate church and state? Yep. First, neither the word God nor the word Jesus appear anywhere in either the Constitution or the Bill of Rights. It's a secular document. This is important because it was the first time that a national government was founded without promoting a state religion. You'd have to understand how out of place for the time a secular Constitution really was to understand the importance of leaving God and Jesus out such an important document; and how doing so clearly shows an intent to not go along with the then universal act of mixing church and state. Second, the only references to religion in the Constitution and the Bill of Right are EXCLUSIONARY. One forbids the government from mandating religious 'tests' in order for someone to serve as a public official. For a bit of context, Delaware was requiring a person to swear an oath that he believed in the Holy Trinity in order to hold a public office, and other states had similar religious requirements for holding government offices. Jefferson and the other founders of our nation said that they would have none of that - which mixes church and state - for the national goverment. The other is, of course, the First Ammendmant, which forbids -- not allows -- the government from doing certain things related to religion. You would need to know the historical context - the conditions prevailing in that day - to know just how anti-status quo this was too, and how therefore just by saying ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; . . ."" showed that the intention was to do away with the then universal union of church and state. Now, it is EVERYONE who ratified the Constitution and agreed to the Bill of Rights - not just Jefferson - who understood, because of the obvious change from the status quo that was in place at the time, that the documents were meant to do away with the then standard practice of mixing church and state, and therefore, to separate church and state. And yet, funny enough, it wasn't Jefferson alone who made the Constitution our governing document, seeing as how every state ratified the SECULAR Constitution. And he didn't change anything! He EXPLAINED the INTENT. That's not changing the wording of the Constitution, nor is it changing the interpretation. Quite the opposite. Any Supreme Court justice who interprets the First Ammendent as other than intending to build a wall of separation between church and state is the one who is changing the intent of it. Uhm, pay attention to context. The person I was responding to thought that the Supreme Court just made up this notion of ""separation of church and state"", and my quotes of Jefferson - and Grant - showed him to be wrong. Look, I'm sorry if you don't like the fact that our nation was founded on a secular document, part of which was intended to build a wall of separation between church and state ... but if you despise this government's very foundations so much, you can always move to a country that was founded on a state religion ... like one in the middle east.","marc9000","156099","Gee, I don't think so.

Any comments on the Thanksgiving day holiday? How about Jefferson's treaty with the Kaskaskia Indians, which provided annual cash support for the tribe's Roman Catholic Priest and church? Congress appropraited public money time and time again for Indian education carried on by religious organizations, in the 19th century.

""...shall not be taken for public use without just compensation."" ""...nor execssive fines imposed..."" (ever hear of Merck Pharmaceuticals?) ""...are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.""

"08-23-2005","6149",7,"DamEtel","None","And? When they DID think about it, they referenced Jefferson's explanatory statements, penned shortly after the Bill of Rights itself was written, by one of the primary founding fathers of our nation. Sure. The 'template' for the Constitution, Virginia's 1786 Act for Establishing Religious Freedom. There was much political - which at the time also meant religious! - debate about Jefferson's proposal, which is one reason it took until 1786 to pass. I'd imagine that in those days, when Washington was a god, he could have done all sorts of questionable things, without being questioned about them. I mean, come on, consider what our current George W - XXXXX and hypocrite - gets away with ... and he, sir, is no Washington! Also, opposing religious things in those days was virtual political suicide. Just ask Jefferson! And let's not forget how Jefferson handled this issue... Washington's thanksgiving proclamations may have gone officially unchallenged, but Jefferson - as president - refused to do it and considered it a violation of the First Amendment. He's one hell of a lot more authoritative on the matter than you are! Can you show us a founding father's statements, made just after the Consistution and Bill of Rights were written, that says the First Amendment is NOT supposed to build a wal of separationg between chruch and state? This member of Government [the judiciary] was at first considered as the most harmless and helpless of all it's organs. But it has proved that the power of declaring what the law is...by sapping and mining slyly and without alarm the foundations of the Constitution, and do what open force would not dare to attempt. Probably because freethinkers these days don't risk the same kind of retaliation as they did back then. Hell, just about 10 years ago an atheist who put a stop to school prayer - Madalyn Murray O'Hair - was brutally murdered. Kind of tough for freethinkers to speak out against religious wrongs when those who do get killed, are mistreated, or face destroying their own political careers. Religious persecution still occurs in America today! The religous persecute those who as not religious. Over the years, the opposition to freethough has risen and subsided and risen and .... When it's on an upswing, we shouldn't expect to see much protesting of religious actions. What words? And what is the it that people ratified? Gee, am I supposed to be able to figure out what your intent is just by reading some words? :-) Jefferson didn't add words to the text, and he didn't change the interpretation ... he explained the original intent No, those who interpret the First Amendment in a manner other than the original intent - as spelled out by Jefferson - are those who are changing it. Are you an undereducated religious fundamentalist, as almost all of the bashers of ""separation of church and state"" are?","marc9000","156671","Do you really believe a courtesy note to a religious group can by used as an all-encompassing, last word analyzation of the entire first amendment? I was asking about the period AFTER the Constitution and Bill of Rights were established and ratified, not before. I'd imagine he couldn't have done any more questionable things than any president in any other time, possibly less. He was the first president, probably a lot of jealousy. And a very fresh Constitution. Just think, a decent percentage of people and politicians probably actually understood it! I can't communicate with the dead. He was outvoted on that one two to one, wasn't he? Why do you hold Jefferson's views so much higher than the other founding fathers? Why do you expect everyone else to? He didn't have to do it because it was already done. He specifically considered Thanksgiving day a violation of the First Amendment? Can you reference that, or did you just make it up? That's true. And it's equally true that you aren't qualified to speak for him. No. I can't find anything by them that says we can't change to communism in 50 years either, but I think it's safe to say they didn't want it. But I can show you a statement by Jefferson about judicial activism, written in 1825, after he had a chance to see how the U.S. system of government worked. (letter from Jefferson to Edward Livingston, 1825) Kind of reminds you of the recent eminent domain law, doesn't it? O,Hair's murder ""political retaliation"" / Religious persecution - give me a break. The words, ""separation of church and state"". Please concentrate.

To be fair, I must admit that Bush signed it, and IMO Bush was wrong to do that. I believe he signed it to avoid a media onslaught. No excuse, but I think he's far less guilty than the Supreme Court. A correct interpretation one was the Railroad Retirement Act of 1934. This was legislation passed by Congress (citing the commerce clause), establishing compulsory retirement plans for railroad workers. The Supreme Court invalidated it in 1935 because it interpreted NO Constitutional authority to regulate a business relationship between employer and employee. THAT is how the system is supposed to work. Not when they subtract words, like ""shall make no law"", or when they add words, like ""separation of church & state"". That is true. There are no well defined steps in the Constitution to correct their errors, or control their adjudications.

They were wrong about that. What responsibility would that be? I'm trying to show that they DON'T have responsibilities that they claim to have. Try this one; Justice Anthony Kennedy, speaking to the American Bar Association in 2003; Since it's federal law, and not prohibited by the Constitution, no one should care what he ""personally accepts"" about it. Maybe I'm wrong, but I'd bet you won't find GOOD Supreme Court justices like Clarence Thomas or Antonin Scalia pubicly spouting off about what they can or can't personally accept, if it hasn't to do with constitutional law.

I suppose to privileged white men in the 50's those days would be missed but for everyone else it's a different story.... And Morality is subject to the believer... Government should not be influenced by anyone's faith period especially law... There is such a thing as separation of church and state. I myself am a person of faith, but I would never want my belief imposed on this entire country or it's elements because it defeats the true meaning of freedom and democracy.... There is a freedom of religion and a freedom FROM religion in this country...","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","08:32 PM","government-debates","206"
