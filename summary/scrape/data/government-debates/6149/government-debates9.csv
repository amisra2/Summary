Few people are literate to any great degree either, but I still support the building of libraries...","DamEtel","166887","Any ""atheist"" who: 1) professes to be a DEVOUT atheist (devout being a term that is usually seen being applied to a religion, such as ""Tom is a devout Christian"") and 2) states he has no problem with the US goverment building churches using taxpayer funds automatically has his claim to be an atheist doubted. I don't know what kind of atheist you claim to be, or think you are, but you sure don't appear to hold a rather standard atheist view, and you also used religious terminology where non-religious terminology would do just as well.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","08:18 AM","government-debates","121"

I almost put devout in quotation marks, but in the end left it. It was meant to be humourous. Oh well. As to what kind I claim or think I am: I am a Gnostic Atheist, or Strong Atheist as it is sometimes called in that I believe , not just surmise, that there is no god. I have no problem with the government supporting anything that can be useful to society. If a community can benefit from a church/ mosque/ synagogue then why should my personal belief conflict with that? Unlike many that follow those religions I am secure enough in my own beliefs to be able to accept that not everyone follows them, and I don't need to convert people to the true path! Of course if the government was pushing one particular religion, or attempting to convert then I would have a very big problem with it.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","08:59 AM","government-debates","122"

What would happen if the government started supporting a single faith and not others? They could practically tax the people into being a certain faith. This is why government needs to be kept far away from religion, the people can decide for themselves, the government doesn't need to ""help"".","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","04:39 AM","government-debates","125"

Not only have they forced intelligent design to be taught in science classes, but now they impose their christian morality upon us all? What are your opinions on this?","FredVonFlash","203944","My opinion is that the government has no moral or legal authority whatsoever over the duty that we owe to our Creator.

Separation of church & state never did mean much, since it's not in the Constitution. Amendment I. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.","simone","205000","Um, do you choose to ignore the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, enacted on December 15, 1791? Just to refresh your memory, or acquaint you with the Amendment in case you didn't know about it before, after all it's only been around for two centuries: Now, I suppose I'm going to have to explain to you precisely what the First Amendment means. It means that the State shall be separate from the Church and will do nothing to establish the Chuch, nor shall the State do anything to hinder the Church. As to freedom of speech, it means that the people of the United States of America shall not be prevented from free expression. As to freedom of the press, it means that the press shall operate separately from the State, not as an agent of the State, the press shall be a separate agent, the Fourth Estate --have you heard about the term ""Fourth Estate"" before?--meaning that the press shall have the freedom to be critical of the Government. As to the freedom to peaceable assemble, to petition the Government for redress of grievances, it means that the people of the United States of America shall have the freedom to peaceably gather to demonstrate and protest what they consider to be the illicit conduct of Government and to demand redress for that conduct.

It also meant the mail was transported on Sunday even if it violated the commandment to remember the Sabbath and to keep it holy. It further meant that Congress did not ask the President to issue religious recommendations to the people regarding prayer, fasting and the giving of thanks; and that the President did not issue religious advice even if Congress, or the Dutch Reformed Church, asked him to.

"12-09-2006","6149",9,"marc9000","153984","I think the ""movements"" don't attempt to identify themselves as anti-Christian or satanic, they simply try to invoke activities into our society that have never traditionally been there, to cheapen Christianity. Things like state lotteries, casino gambling, gay marriage, smut on the internet and cable television - all things that were all but completely absent ""20 years ago"". ""Movements and goals"" that go back a little further than 20 years would be Hollywood and the music industry's largely subliminal jabs at things like parental authority and morals in general. Those exact words were written by Thomas Jefferson to the Danbuy Baptists in 1802, and have been debated and discussed ever since. A few liberal Supreme Court justices along with our liberal news media have done an amazing job of convincing many uninformed people that they are in the Constitution.","Shooterandproud","242713","You mean personal liberties and freedoms? You're right, god forbid we have any personal liberties or freedoms, we must have the government and the pope decide everything for us!

"12-09-2006","6149",9,"marc9000","153988","Can you imagine the first president proclaiming a national day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God within days of the vote on the Bill of Rights? Why didn't all these ""diests"" object? Can you imagine the very effective separation between religion and state originally applying ONLY to Congress, and not to the states? They did not prohibit states from establishing religions, and several of them did. That has changed since the days of all those ""diests"", and I think it's a good thing. You'd think athiests would be satisfied with that. But it seems that those who seek to destroy Christianity are never satisfied.","Shooterandproud","242714","Actually, atheists only advocate freedom.

"12-09-2006","6149",9,"marc9000","154241","The opening post of this thread didn't specify any certain threats from Christian Coalitions that insist that you be religious. Can you name any? If you can, we'll compare them to some threats by the ACLU, and AU. (Americans United) We'll also compare the political influence of the sources of the threats. Not everything can be broken down into three neat catagories. (Christian, anti-Christian, and neutral.) Neutrality often isn't an issue in a society full of humans, humans who often have problems with purpose, failure, loss, sickness, disability, birth, and death. Neutrality and anti-Christianity are indistinguishable in many cases - they have the same non-answers. Life is meaningless, if it feels good do it. Live for the moment. And society is jeapordized by it. The framers and yesterdays general public knew it, judging from the almost countless times public money funded religious organizations in the U.S. first 150 years of existance. The concept is NOT there, not in the Constitution. It IS in judicial activism. I think you're confusing the two.","Shooterandproud","242717","How come you paint all of that as a bad thing? Thank god for the ACLU, as if it weren't for them, we'd be living in a conservative utopia, with religion running wild destroying our society, the inquisition being reinstated, i can't imagine it. Religion is a major obstacle in peace. Why do you insist people believe your religion? Why are you not happy that we are at least allowing you to practice your religion. What more do you want? Do you want radical conservativism implimented into law? Thats just silly.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","03:41 PM","government-debates","135"
