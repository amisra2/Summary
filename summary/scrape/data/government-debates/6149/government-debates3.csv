"08-10-2005","6149",3,"biccat","None","Religions could provide funding to certain politicians, they could publicly support a politician, they could voice their opinions on certain laws and decisions, or encourage their members to vote a certain way. All of these are permitted, despite the fact that ""religions can't mess with government."" What about selling alcohol on Sunday, or anti-prostitution laws? But we do this all the time. Why do medical researchers have an ethical code that prohibits experiments on humans except in carefully controlled situations? The fact is that there is an underlying morality, based on more than weighing the pros and cons of a certain course of action. There are certain issues on which (historically) there can be no compromise, even if people disagree with the issue (drug use, prostitution, euthenasia, human experimentation, etc.).","Kronus","154110","Sure they're permitted, as examples of freedom of speech. As I said, the enforcement of the bill of rights must be tempered with common sense. According to the first amendment people are allowed to say, ""write this law based on my religion."" And the government is then required to say no, also due to the first amendment. What about them? You were saying that laws are based on morals, and are therefore religious and not secular. I gave a counter example to show that your claim was incorrect. The fact that some laws, like no booze on sunday, do have a religious basis just shows that the system is imperfect and things slip through, not that laws aren't or shouldn't be secular. I agree that there is an underlying morallity. However, I don't belive, as you seem to imply, that religion provides that morallity. Rather I think that religions have tapped into and codified that morality. The principle came first, and religions adopted it. And what is this basic moral principle? Simply put, things that hurt people are bad and things that help people are good. Vastly oversimplified of course, and with lots of room for discussion, but I believe that that is the esssence of any succesful moral system, including the religious ones. So to use your first example, why does the medical code of ethics strictly regulate human experimentation? Not because God told them to do it that way, but because they want to insure as much as possible that they do more good than harm. The risk of harm to the individuals being experimented on must be outweighed by the good the experiments are expected to do.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","12:58 PM","government-debates","31"
"08-10-2005","6149",3,"Kronus","None","By that reasoning freedom of speech and the press would also not be solid rights, since they use exactly the same wording, and in fact are part of the same sentence, as the establishment clause. All of the amendments in the Bill of Rights use slightly different turns of phrase; I really don't think the intention there was to say that they really really meant it with some of the amendments, and only sort of meant it on others, based soley on subtelties of wording.","gnojek","154150","Right. At one point in our history it wasn't clear that a person was guaranteed free speech and press. The federal government, or really only Congress, was the only body restricted from infringing upon these rights. State legislatures could make some law (not after the equal protection clause) or a governor could give an executive order to restrict speech or press or religion. In court they couls argue that Congress wasn't involved so it was constitutional. That's my take on it, anyway (I wasn't there.) The Constitution is very carefully worded. Each wording is slightly different based on how those words could be interpreted. The ""subtleties"" are programmed in from the get go.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","04:19 PM","government-debates","32"

After the 14th amendment was passed, section 5 only applied to the provisions of the 14th amendment: namely equal protection, etc. Since the 14th amendment concerned the duties of states, and Congress was explicitly given authority to enforce the provisions of the 14th amendment, this was a backdoor for Congress to have absolute authority over the states. Since then, most of the provisions of the Constitution and Bill of Rights have been incorporated into the 14th amendment, so that the Federal Government has nearly absolute authority over the states. Particularly the Seventh and parts of the Fifth amendments haven't yet been incorporated, and it's unlikely that they will be.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","05:54 PM","government-debates","35"
"08-10-2005","6149",3,"Kronus","None","That's not a movement! And it certainly isn't anti-christian. That's just people living their lives the way they choose to. Don't like lotteries? Then don't play them. Don't subscribe to cable if you don't like what's on there. Absolutely nothing you describe prevents you from following your religion in the way that you wish. It only means that others aren't living their lives in the way that you would wish. And that's the way it should be. Just as no one should tell you to stop acting the way you feel your religion requires, you shouldn't expect people to live a certain way, based on your beliefs. People may not be following your religious standards, but that isn't an attack on Christianity. As long as you personally can follow your religion then talk of an anti-christian movement is just scare tactics. There's no liberal conspiracy to make people think those words are in the Constitution! That's just silliness. The concept is in there, that's clear. And given that the concept is there what would be the point of this campaign to fool people into thinking that the actual words are there?","marc9000","154241","The opening post of this thread didn't specify any certain threats from Christian Coalitions that insist that you be religious.

It specifically talked about religious activists trying to replace science with religious dogma. Now name one single thing that the ACLU has done that prevents you from worshipping in the way that you like. Don't you see what you're saying here? You're insisting that you, and only you, have the right answers on how to live life. And you want to impose those answers on everyone else. Sorry, but you don't get to. Everyone gets to decide for themselves which religious path, if any, to follow. You're not asking for the freedom to practice your own religion, you're looking for the authority to cram it down other people's throats. You wouldn't stand for it if someone tried to forceably convert you, why are you trying to do the same thing to others? Can't you see how hypocritical that is? It is there.

The Kansas Board of Education voting, today, to diminish the role of evolution in the state's science curriculum. The ballot in preliminary, the board expected to make its final decision in the next couple of months. This is round two for the state of Kansas and about round 102 for the country. But unlike prior battles, strict biblical creationism barely gets a mention. Instead, even though critics call it a way of dressing God up in a lab coat , opponents of evolution say they're fighting science with science. Here's CNN's Ed Lavendera. ED LAVENDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The battle over how to teach science is erupting in Kansas. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Leave the room, sir. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not going to leave the room. LAVENDERA: It's the latest fight to bring the theory of intelligent design to a classroom near you. The Kansas State Board of Education is considering new science curriculum standards that offer a more critical view of evolution. Supporters don't understand why many scientists aren't open to this debate. JOHN CALVERT, INTELLIGENT DESIGN SUPPORTER: They also are favoring a set of standards that do not allow or comprehend criticisms of evolution. LAVENDERA: Many teachers are angry to see what they call bad science make it into the classroom. STEVEN CASE, INTELLIGENT DESIGN OPPONENT: Those are inappropriate changes. Some for educational reasons, some for scientific reasons. LAVENDERA: Intelligent design, or I.D., as it's often called, is the idea that the universe is so complicated that some things cannot be explained by science alone, that there must be some intelligent source behind the world's creation. Intelligent design theory does not say God is responsible, that's where it differs from creationism. But skeptics say intelligent design simply disguises religion in a shroud of science. Critics often call it science fiction. STEPHEN MEYER, DISCOVERY INSTITUTE: If we put intelligent design into our biology textbooks, based on the misrepresentation of real scientific fact and the conjecture that its proponents rely on, then we may as well add the study of flying saucers and aliens from outer space to our biology and physics books. LAVENDERA: A recent Harris Interactive poll found 64 percent of Americans believe in creationism, that human beings were created directly by God. 22 percent believe in the theory of evolution. And 10 percent support intelligent design. But when it comes to the question facing hundreds of school districts around the country, 55 percent of Americans believe all three ideas should be taught in school together. Intelligent design even has President Bush's support. He says it should be taught in schools along with evolution. Supporters argue intelligent design is a legitimate science worthy of debate as an alternative to what they see as the flawed theory of evolution. JOHN COURAGE, HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE TEACHER: We've had 150 years of one dogma ruling biology. What we're asking for is that Darwinian evolution be taught to students, but also the current scientific criticisms of the theory. LAVENDERA: Like the proverbial elephant in the room, intelligent design is roaming through classrooms and school board meetings around the country. Everyone knows it's there, but many scientists still don't want to talk to it, for fear of giving it too much credibility. But it appears intelligent design may might already be gaining in the war of acceptance.","gnojek","154450","Jesus TF Christ, you are really freaking me out right now. I was even more freaked out when all in the same day Washington Journal (C-span) talked about intellegent design and then in the evening on CNN, on Newsnight with Aaron Brown. On that show they talked about ID as if it WERE actually science. They said things like ""Critics say it's like dressing God up in a lab coat."" Critics don't say that. They wouldn't even give it that much credit. Then they kept calling it a science over and over again. I was shitting on myself.
