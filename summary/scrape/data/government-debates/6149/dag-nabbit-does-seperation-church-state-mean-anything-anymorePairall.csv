"05-27-2009",1,"6149","178","Chuz Life","355059","Again, you dodge the question and instead answer one that I didn't ask. So, I'll ask one more time with the follow up question of ""how do you think it makes you look when you have to avoid direct questions by giving evasive answers this way?"" CUNX, ""Do you believe a child's basic rights should begin when their life does?"" Yes or no. For reference; I can't imagine how you can conceive (per your comments in that earlier post) that killing a pregnant woman can be prosecuted as ""TWO MURDERS ;"" Yet, the ""murdered"" (your word) pre-birth child had no rights to be violated ?!? Do you care enough to explain how that works?","CUNxTime","355192","I think I've been pretty clear... but I'll try again. The mother's right to control her body supersede any rights the baby has. The mother has the right to bring her baby to term or she has the right to terminate in the early stages of pregnancy.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","09:50 AM","government-debates","51"

How can you ""murder"" a child that has no rights? You have not explained how this can be. Please be clear on the Constitutional basis for claiming that when a stranger kills the baby it's MURDER,... but when the mother kills the baby (for any reason she wants) it's not. Sorry, but I need something more than ""because I said so.""","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","10:00 AM","government-debates","93"

A third party doesn't have the right to terminate someone else's pregnancy forceably...hence double murder. And I'm pretty sure that's how the law works as well in many states, so while its my opinion (because I said so), there is also a basis for this legally.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","10:05 AM","government-debates","75"

Some-one needs to explain how a woman can ""consent"" to have sex, risk pregnancy, create what you agree is a child WITH rights and then have the right themself to deny those rights to her child and to kill it for any reason she deems necessary; However, if and when someone else intentionally kills that same child? THEY are liable for ""murder."" What's that make an abortionist?","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","10:15 AM","government-debates","91"
