"08-11-2005","6149",4,"Kronus","None","Of course it did, what post were you reading? It specifically talked about religious activists trying to replace science with religious dogma. Now name one single thing that the ACLU has done that prevents you from worshipping in the way that you like. Don't you see what you're saying here? You're insisting that you, and only you, have the right answers on how to live life. And you want to impose those answers on everyone else. Sorry, but you don't get to. Everyone gets to decide for themselves which religious path, if any, to follow. You're not asking for the freedom to practice your own religion, you're looking for the authority to cram it down other people's throats. You wouldn't stand for it if someone tried to forceably convert you, why are you trying to do the same thing to others? Can't you see how hypocritical that is? It is there. If you won't believe me than ask any Constitutional lawyer. I'll do some googling on my own just in case you don't happen to know any and get back to you. In the mean time, what do you think the first amendment is saying?","marc9000","154506","Post #1. Why do you insist that evolution be taught 100% and creation be taught 0%? How in the world does evening the percentages in any slight way FORCE a student to be religious? If more than half of the taxpayers who fund education believe in creation, why shouldn't it be taught? You imply that evolution with no creator involved is a proven fact. It is not. The Supreme court, (often influenced by the ACLU and other anti-Christians) recently ruled that private property can be taken (with compensation, but without owner consent) by government and transferred to another private interest, for the public good. (increased tax revenue = public good) Churches are one of the lowest generators of tax revenue compared to for-profit business. Churches WILL BE seized, and it's members will be prevented from worshiping the way they like. Please read it again. I DIDN'T say me and only me, I said the framers and the general public. I'm not trying to forceably convert anyone. I'm saying that the general public, the text of the constitution, and the intent of the framers should be able to HOLD THE LINE in newly legalizing reckless, selfish behaviors that statistics and history show will lead to more and more unproductive people that will have to be propped up by taxpayers. I know of several without searching. Ann Coulter is a constitutional attorney. It says that Congress can't establish ONE religion (like the Church of England of that era - 1791) nor prohibit the free exersise therof. That's what it says, and it took effect on 12-15-1791. TWO WEEKS LATER, George Washington proclaimed the next 26th of November as a day to be ""devoted by the people of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being""....

Please explain to me how that can mean anything other than that the first amendment was meant to ensure a seperation of church and state. It is impossible to build sound constitutional doctrine upon a mistaken understanding of constitutional history, expresssly freighted with Jefferson's misleading metaphor for nearly forty years. Thomas Jefferson was of course in France at the time the constitutional amendments known as the Bill of Rights were pressed by Congress and ratified by the States. His letter to the Danbury Baptist Association was a short note of courtesy, written fourteen years after the amendments were passed by Congress. He would seem to any detached observer as a less than ideal source of contemporary history to the meaning of the Religious Clauses of the first Amendment. The Establishment Clause did not require government neutrality between religion and irreligion nor did it prohibit the Federal Government from providing nondiscriminatory aid to religion. There is simply no historical foundation for the proposition that the Framers intneded to build the ""wall of seperation""..... ....The ""wall of seperation between church and State"" is a metaphor based on bad history, a metaphor which has proved useless as a guide to judging. It should be frankly and explicitly be abandoned. [since 1947] our Establishment Clause cases have been neither principaled nor unified. Our recent opinions, many of them hopelessly divided pluralities, have with embarrassing candor conceded that the ""wall of separation"" is merely a blurred, indistinct, and variable barrier, which is not wholly accurate, and can only be dimly perceived.""

"08-12-2005","6149",4,"Truthsayer","None","Reading this, I see that George Washington was keeping in line with his Masonic tenents that endorse a Supreme Being but do not, as a group, endorse any particular diety (Jesus, Allah, Buddah, etc..) or religion, persay. In other words, he was saying, ""devoted by the people of these States to the service of that great and glorious <fill in the blanks>"" .... George Washington, the ""Father of our country"", was a Freemason as were a lot of our founding fathers. No one wanted to keep religion and government seperate any more than they did. They laid the groundwork, or the ""cornerstone,"" if you will, for our nation and, bad or good, it still stands. As does the fraternity. There's a lesson in there somewhere's. Add religion to any institution and havoc will follow. Harmony and strength are the support of all institutions, more especially of ours. That is why it is so important to keep religion at arms length and never take your eye off of it. It can be deadlier than a tornado. Whereas it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his protection and favor-- and whereas both Houses of Congress have by their joint Committee requested me to recommend to the People of the United States a day of public thanksgiving and prayer to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many signal favors of Almighty God especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for their safety and happiness. Now therefore I do recommend and assign Thursday the 26th day of November next to be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be-- That we may then all unite in rendering unto him our sincere and humble thanks--for his kind care and protection of the People of this Country previous to their becoming a Nation--for the signal and manifold mercies, and the favorable interpositions of his Providence which we experienced in the course and conclusion of the late war--for the great degree of tranquility, union, and plenty, which we have since enjoyed--for the peaceable and rational manner, in which we have been enabled to establish constitutions of government for our safety and happiness, and particularly the national One now lately instituted--for the civil and religious liberty with which we are blessed; and the means we have of acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge; and in general for all the great and various favors which he hath been pleased to confer upon us. and also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations and beseech him to pardon our national and other transgressions-- to enable us all, whether in public or private stations, to perform our several and relative duties properly and punctually--to render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed--to protect and guide all Sovereigns and Nations (especially such as have shewn kindness unto us) and to bless them with good government, peace, and concord--To promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue, and the encrease of science among them and us--and generally to grant unto all Mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as he alone knows to be best.

So why teach that animal X evolved into animals Y & Z when we can't actually show that this occurred? Evolution teaches a conclusion, this is the evidence, and this is a rational extrapolation of the evidence. But that's not what anti-creationists want to teach, they just want to teach the conclusion without demonstrating the evidence or the fact that the theory itself is an extrapolation of evidence.

The main gaping hole is this; Untill about the time of Einstein, Athiests could comfort themselves with the belief that the universe is eternal, and thus did not need a cause. But since then, five lines of scientific evidence have been discovered that prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the universe did indeed have a beginning. Science has proven, by it's own methods, that the world began abruptly in an act of creation to which you can trace the seeds of every star, every planet, every living thing in this cosmos and on the earth. And it has found that all this happened as a product of forces that man cannot hope to discover - supernatural forces. It takes every bit as much faith to be an evolutionist as it does to be a creationist. I agree. Interpretation is the problem. The Supreme Court is supposed to do it, and more and more of the general public seems to think they're doing a pretty lousy job of it. Atheism is arguably a religion. As I showed above, science can't hope to prove that the universe began without a supernatural creator. Why should their assumption that there is no creator be taught as fact, with no other (at least equal) assumptions not be permitted to be taught in our schools? What kind of a question is that? I didn't admit to not understanding it, I questioned his understanding of it. Even if I didn't understand something, chances are I'd know where it wasn't.

Seperation of church and state means that the government should not: A) Suppress the free excercise of religion, within reasonable bounaries (no human sacrifice for example) B) Endorse one religion over another, or endorse religion over non religion. (IE, the government shouldn't pressure your religious decisions) C) Enact laws which have a strictly religious purpose.
