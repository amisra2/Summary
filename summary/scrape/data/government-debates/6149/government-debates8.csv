"08-25-2005","6149",8,"marc9000","None","How about two examples, one where there was re-interpretation, and one where there was correct interpretation. A re-interpretation one was McCain-Feingold, where the Supreme Court found the words ""shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech...."" to be not as important as their personal opinions that Congress has broad authority in acting against the corrupting power of money in politics. To be fair, I must admit that Bush signed it, and IMO Bush was wrong to do that. I believe he signed it to avoid a media onslaught. No excuse, but I think he's far less guilty than the Supreme Court. A correct interpretation one was the Railroad Retirement Act of 1934. This was legislation passed by Congress (citing the commerce clause), establishing compulsory retirement plans for railroad workers. The Supreme Court invalidated it in 1935 because it interpreted NO Constitutional authority to regulate a business relationship between employer and employee. THAT is how the system is supposed to work.","Kronus","156958","You have proved my point far more elegantly than I ever could. Both cases you site are examples of the SC expressing legal opinions. However, you don't like the first decision, and so you claim the SC acted incorrectly. You have no problem with the second decision, so that's a case where the SC acted ""correctly"". Clearly your definition of a correct/incorrect ruling is one which you agree/disagree with. At least that's consistent with your ""reasoning"" throughout this debate, I'll grant you that.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","08:47 AM","government-debates","106"

A Church has every right to try to get their views into law as NOW or anyother group in the US. Just because it happens to be a Church shouldn't limit anything.
