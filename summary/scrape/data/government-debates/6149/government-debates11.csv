The point is that the laws that you advocate because of your religion would be a violation of the 1st Amendment principle of separation of church and state.","Tdkocher","304096","Can you please show me where the words ""Seperation of Church and State"" are in the constitution? No, you can't because they aren't. They were found in a letter written by Thomas Jefferson to the Danbury Baptist Association in 1802. It is a political idea that has come from that letter as the base but has been used by the left to justify their war on religion, Christians' in particular, and now Christians' have had enough and are fighting back. Good thing we have the ACL J .","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","09:46 AM","government-debates","151"

The good old moral institution of slavery.","Tdkocher","304097","You are jugging them to our standards in their time. That is like critisizing all army persons' in the British army when they controlled India and treated them in a degrading and rasist manner. Then didn't know any better and were following orders. At that time the British expansion ideal was seen in the community as aprpriate. We now know otherwise but it wouldn't be fair to hold this knowledge over them and say they wern't moral. At that time so where and some were not moral but we cannot hold them to standards that have changed since then.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","09:52 AM","government-debates","152"

It should play no role is supporting or hindering the free excises of religious beliefs. The government was to be run according to the principals of LAW. The founding fathers wanted to make sure that the government never obstructed religion on one hand but more importantly, they wanted religion to play NO PART in the government (they were particularly speaking to the Catholic religion and the way the Vatican influenced the government of many Catholic countries). That is what the ""Separation of Church and State"" is, it wasn't spelled out under that specific title in the constitution, but it was spelled out.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","11:07 AM","government-debates","153"

What are your opinions on this?","simone","354671","The monied ruling class has determined that religion is an effective tool in its ongoing class warfare against the lower-income classes.

Only the first part is and it says (basically what I said), that the govt. shouldn't be in the business of supporting OR hindering religious exercise. It's pretty strait forward. Now, that said, I want to make it clear that I support religious (or non religious) people 'petitioning the govt.', assembling, any kind of free speech, all that. But I'll not have the pope or Billy Gramm setting govt. policy anymore than I want Michael Moore doing it.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","09:06 PM","government-debates","156"

How many posts would you like for me to link you to where I have fought against the injection of religion into the issue? Question,.. if abortion is not a denial of a child's rights,.. what is so ""horrid"" about it? If it's only about the rights and freedoms of the woman (as you claim),.. why wouldn't an abortion be cause for celebration?
