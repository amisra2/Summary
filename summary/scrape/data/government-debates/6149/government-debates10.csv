Thank god for the ACLU, as if it weren't for them, we'd be living in a conservative utopia, with religion running wild destroying our society, the inquisition being reinstated, i can't imagine it. Religion is a major obstacle in peace. Why do you insist people believe your religion? Why are you not happy that we are at least allowing you to practice your religion. What more do you want? Do you want radical conservativism implimented into law? Thats just silly.","Bassman","242723","As a matter of fact, it was Liberal policies that did more damage to this country. Starting with FDR and his ""New Deal"" to LBJ and the very destructive ""war on Poverty"". You've seen the results, but I guess as an avowed Socialist, you still insist that pumping more and more money into thes failed programs, they'll work better.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","06:24 PM","government-debates","136"

My children haven't broken the law. Both are adults, one an attorney and the other an Army NCO (who also has a master's degree). Good tax paying citizens and they were not forced to stand and recite christian prayers. By the way, are you aware that the population of our prisons is overwhelmingly christian? Did you know that the percentage of atheists in prison is less than the percentage in the population over all? Why do you thini that is?","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","03:34 PM","government-debates","137"

Right. Just because I'm not a right-wing nut-job, doesn't mean I'm a socialist. Liberals have had a nasty habit of being right in history. Whether it was abolishing slavery to women's rights, the conservatives were the oppressors. We were right then and we are right now.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","10:18 PM","government-debates","140"
"10-18-2007","6149",10,"SymonTemplar","154485","Funny though that you find many stellar physicists are religious. Saw one interview once with an expert on the big bang. He said science will only ever get us within micro fractions of milliseconds after the big bang. What came before will probably always be a matter of faith in his opinion.","Antibogotes","288140","You find lots of every kind of scientist who are religious. I'm a Buddhist. In Buddhism it is explicitly taught (Malunkyaputtasutta) that religion has nothing to say about the origin of the universe. It can only address human error and human suffering, their causes and cures. Also, you shouldn't believe that just because scripture says so. Belief is not faith, particularly belief in nonsense. Belief doesn't make you a better person. That takes work. Your numbers are off. A milli-microsecond is a nanosecond, 10^-9 sec, or 0.000000001 second. We have electric circuits that operate faster than that. Our understanding of physics takes us back to within 10^-44 (0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000001) seconds after the Big Bang. However, there are a number of theories of the time before the Big Bang, with quite odd names such as the False Vacuum. I'm afraid I can't explain the math, but this theory proposes that there were large numbers of Big Bangs starting in extremely small regions of space (but not singularities), and still are, outside the region of spacetime that we and our galaxies inhabit.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","01:52 AM","government-debates","141"

I think that ratio of christian criminals to atheist criminals in our population is higher than the ration of christians to atheists. Thus, the ration holds in our prison populations. Probably most. I haven't found that christians are particularly honest or moral. As a percentage, yes. No. No one has said that. The point is that the laws that you advocate because of your religion would be a violation of the 1st Amendment principle of separation of church and state.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","12:00 PM","government-debates","145"
