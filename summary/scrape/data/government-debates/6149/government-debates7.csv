A well thought out phrase doesn't need additional words. Every phrase in the Constitution was well thought out.","Kronus","156266","That's an utterly ludicrous statement, for multiple reasons. If every phrase in the Constitution is so perfect, we wouldn't need a Supreme court to interpret it. English is an imprecise language; almost any sentence can have multiple interpretations, with changes in meaning both subtle and gross. And most importantly, the Constitution was meant to be interpreted! It's not a legal straightjacket, it's a set of guidelines and principles.

"08-22-2005","6149",7,"zachvac","None","there are a couple of phrases you used, let's see if I can rephrase them. #1. I didn't say it was impossible to explain a group of words with other words, but it's common for people to incorrectly misiniterpret the phrase for political puurposes #2. Single words are defined in dictionaries, not groups of words. There is a colossal difference. An intelligent phrase needs no addition. The Constitution is filled with such thought-out phrases. No doubt your phrases were thought out, but I rewrote them and they mean more or less the same.","marc9000","156451","Your rephrasing used words that were very comparable to my words. didn't / never isn't possible / impossible intentionally get wrong / incorrectly misinterpret groups of words / phrases big / colossal well thought out / intelligent Yet in the part of the first amendment that we're discussing, we have the main words ""establishment of religion"", and ""prohibiting the free exercise thereof"".

The constitution defines and establishes the distribution, authority, and structure of Government. The process by which decisions are made. The Constitution is principles, not specifics, and it stands on it's own just fine, to those who halfway understand it. And it's the job of legislatures, states and people, to determine specifics about things like assault rifles, news sources, and flag burning. And there is a process to do it, without eliminating or changing it's principles in the slightest. Slavery was outlawed by the 13th amendment, NOT by judicial order. Women were given the right to vote by the 19th amendment, not by judicial order. No, I call them political decisions made by the wrong people according to the Constitution. I do take that stance, every single re-interpretation when the legislatures, states, or people didn't have the slightest say in the matter.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","07:37 PM","government-debates","99"
"08-23-2005","6149",7,"DamEtel","None","You nailed him on that one! Yes, and lucky for us all, the Supreme Court has Jefferson's explanations, dataing back to just after the Bill of Rights was created, of what the First Ammendment's religious restrictions were originally intended to do: to build a ""wall of separation between church and state"".","marc9000","156666","He did? I didn't notice. If his letter to the Danbury Baptists 11 years later is all you've got on that, sorry - it's just not there.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","07:46 PM","government-debates","100"
"08-23-2005","6149",7,"DamEtel","None","And? When they DID think about it, they referenced Jefferson's explanatory statements, penned shortly after the Bill of Rights itself was written, by one of the primary founding fathers of our nation. Sure. The 'template' for the Constitution, Virginia's 1786 Act for Establishing Religious Freedom. There was much political - which at the time also meant religious! - debate about Jefferson's proposal, which is one reason it took until 1786 to pass. I'd imagine that in those days, when Washington was a god, he could have done all sorts of questionable things, without being questioned about them. I mean, come on, consider what our current George W - XXXXX and hypocrite - gets away with ... and he, sir, is no Washington! Also, opposing religious things in those days was virtual political suicide. Just ask Jefferson! And let's not forget how Jefferson handled this issue... Washington's thanksgiving proclamations may have gone officially unchallenged, but Jefferson - as president - refused to do it and considered it a violation of the First Amendment. He's one hell of a lot more authoritative on the matter than you are! Can you show us a founding father's statements, made just after the Consistution and Bill of Rights were written, that says the First Amendment is NOT supposed to build a wal of separationg between chruch and state? This member of Government [the judiciary] was at first considered as the most harmless and helpless of all it's organs. But it has proved that the power of declaring what the law is...by sapping and mining slyly and without alarm the foundations of the Constitution, and do what open force would not dare to attempt. Probably because freethinkers these days don't risk the same kind of retaliation as they did back then. Hell, just about 10 years ago an atheist who put a stop to school prayer - Madalyn Murray O'Hair - was brutally murdered. Kind of tough for freethinkers to speak out against religious wrongs when those who do get killed, are mistreated, or face destroying their own political careers. Religious persecution still occurs in America today! The religous persecute those who as not religious. Over the years, the opposition to freethough has risen and subsided and risen and .... When it's on an upswing, we shouldn't expect to see much protesting of religious actions. What words? And what is the it that people ratified? Gee, am I supposed to be able to figure out what your intent is just by reading some words? :-) Jefferson didn't add words to the text, and he didn't change the interpretation ... he explained the original intent No, those who interpret the First Amendment in a manner other than the original intent - as spelled out by Jefferson - are those who are changing it. Are you an undereducated religious fundamentalist, as almost all of the bashers of ""separation of church and state"" are?","marc9000","156671","Do you really believe a courtesy note to a religious group can by used as an all-encompassing, last word analyzation of the entire first amendment? I was asking about the period AFTER the Constitution and Bill of Rights were established and ratified, not before. I'd imagine he couldn't have done any more questionable things than any president in any other time, possibly less. He was the first president, probably a lot of jealousy. And a very fresh Constitution. Just think, a decent percentage of people and politicians probably actually understood it! I can't communicate with the dead. He was outvoted on that one two to one, wasn't he? Why do you hold Jefferson's views so much higher than the other founding fathers? Why do you expect everyone else to? He didn't have to do it because it was already done. He specifically considered Thanksgiving day a violation of the First Amendment? Can you reference that, or did you just make it up? That's true. And it's equally true that you aren't qualified to speak for him. No. I can't find anything by them that says we can't change to communism in 50 years either, but I think it's safe to say they didn't want it. But I can show you a statement by Jefferson about judicial activism, written in 1825, after he had a chance to see how the U.S. system of government worked. (letter from Jefferson to Edward Livingston, 1825) Kind of reminds you of the recent eminent domain law, doesn't it? O,Hair's murder ""political retaliation"" / Religious persecution - give me a break. The words, ""separation of church and state"". Please concentrate. The Danbury letter was not intended to ""spell it out"". If you want to see things spelled out, check out the Federalist Papers sometime. I'm an originalist. I see you responded to my question with a question, and ducked mine. Maybe this will help you. I honestly believe it's non partisan. http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/proj...aw/interp.html Read the eight reasons for each, Originalist and Non-Originalist, and let me know which one describes you best.

For example, can you give one instance of where a supreme court ruling was based on what the legislature said? No, you can't, because that isn't how the system works, and never was. The Supreme Court rules based on their interpretation of the law and the Constitution, and nothing else. If the legislature et.al. don't like the ruling they're free to try to amend the Constitution.

And that's exactly why they're not. They rule based on legal principles, not whatever political trend is popular this week.","marc9000","156885","How about two examples, one where there was re-interpretation, and one where there was correct interpretation. A re-interpretation one was McCain-Feingold, where the Supreme Court found the words ""shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech...."" to be not as important as their personal opinions that Congress has broad authority in acting against the corrupting power of money in politics. To be fair, I must admit that Bush signed it, and IMO Bush was wrong to do that. I believe he signed it to avoid a media onslaught. No excuse, but I think he's far less guilty than the Supreme Court. A correct interpretation one was the Railroad Retirement Act of 1934. This was legislation passed by Congress (citing the commerce clause), establishing compulsory retirement plans for railroad workers. The Supreme Court invalidated it in 1935 because it interpreted NO Constitutional authority to regulate a business relationship between employer and employee. THAT is how the system is supposed to work. Not when they subtract words, like ""shall make no law"", or when they add words, like ""separation of church & state"". That is true. There are no well defined steps in the Constitution to correct their errors, or control their adjudications. The framers thought that those on the Supreme court would have integrity enough to repect the strict language of the Constitution, or at least would be intimidated by a populace that didn't have their heads in the sand. They were wrong about that. What responsibility would that be? I'm trying to show that they DON'T have responsibilities that they claim to have. Try this one; Justice Anthony Kennedy, speaking to the American Bar Association in 2003; Since it's federal law, and not prohibited by the Constitution, no one should care what he ""personally accepts"" about it. Maybe I'm wrong, but I'd bet you won't find GOOD Supreme Court justices like Clarence Thomas or Antonin Scalia pubicly spouting off about what they can or can't personally accept, if it hasn't to do with constitutional law. They're beholden to LIBERALS, and that's important to a lot of people right now, since the Presidency, House, and Senate aren't beholden to liberals these days.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","08:20 PM","government-debates","104"

Period. I may also lie under oath, sell secrets to enemy governments, etc. because otherwise that would be abridging my freedom of speech.
