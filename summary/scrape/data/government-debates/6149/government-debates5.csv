That's why evolution doesn't go back to how life was created, but how they change. ID doesn't have a single bit of evidence, observation or experimentation supporting it, which is why it should never be considered science. It could be true, but it's not science.","SymonTemplar","154870","I suppose, but it doesn't address the question of the thread. Why is it simply a belief can't be taught?

"08-14-2005","6149",5,"Kronus","None","I hardly think the economics of illegal drugs is comprable to the economics of cable television. The former has very low overhead and a huge profit margin, the latter is just the opposite. You can't run a cable channel without a very large market. And where did your last sentence come from? That made no sense what so ever. Who said anything about market size equalling constitutional protection? You list among anti-christian activities gambling and watching smut on cable. If only a minority of people engaged in those activites, than there wouldn't be enough of a market to support those activites. Clearly there is a market, which gives the lie to your claim. Trully there isn't, but it's far too broad a topic to cover here. I'll gladly take up the particulars of this issue with you in the creation/evolution forum. All I'll say here is that if your only objection is trully that you want creation taught along side evolution than you could have said so far sooner than this. Are you sure that's what your objection is? Nothing else? You voice your opposition to it, but you're still not saying what you think it is. Here's my take. Seperation of church and state means that the government should not: A) Suppress the free excercise of religion, within reasonable bounaries (no human sacrifice for example) B) Endorse one religion over another, or endorse religion over non religion. (IE, the government shouldn't pressure your religious decisions) C) Enact laws which have a strictly religious purpose. You seem to agree with me on A, but I've gotten the impression that you've come down on both sides of B and C.","marc9000","154965","You implied that if gambling and cable porn were supported by the free market, then it can't be legislated against. I guess I didn't make it clear. Here's what you said; Your (italicized by me) statement is wrong. Another example; a tiny percentage of people work on old Ford trucks, yet companies that sell nothing but parts for old Ford trucks survive - there's enough of a market to support them. It's not my only objection, but it was in post #1 - I've been referring to it throughout this entire thread. My objections all fall into one simple catagory - the mis-interpretation of the first amendment. Here's what I think it is ~ IRRELEVANT, because it's not in the Constitution. Now lets apply your A, B, & C to the TEXT of the First Amendment. A. I agree B. The word ""endorse"" is not in the first amendment. The word ""establishment"" is. Those two words definitions may be slightly similar, but only slightly. The word ""endorse"" is much more vague. I can claim that public funding ""endorses"" the study of evolution, therefore the government endorses atheism. We can do a lot of arguing about what's endorsed, that's the reason the word ""endorse"" isn't in the first amendment. Compared to all the documentation and politics that went into the development of them, the Constitution and Bill of Rights themselves are amazingly short. The words used in them were chosen VERY CAREFULLY. C. I would agree, if a law FORCED a person to be religious. We have no laws, present or past, that have even come close to that.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","03:01 PM","government-debates","66"

It should be frankly and explicitly abandoned. That's right, ""prohibit"" / ""suppress"", close enough! Disagree. The word ""pressure"" isn't in the first amendment. We have had no laws that even come close to that, and if we did I would oppose them. I believe they would be unconstitutional even with a popular vote. They are too much of an ""establishment"". Traditions like celebrating Thanksgiving day, balancing evolution with creationism in schools, public displays of the Ten Commandments, outlawing gay marriage, outlawing abortion, and dozens of other things newly under attack by the AU & ACLU, I believe to be constitutional if they're supported by the public.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","08:02 PM","government-debates","68"

And since you still won't say what you think the phrase means, the judgement is useless. It's a really simple question, and this debate is pointless if you won't answer it. What do you think the phrase means? Why are you so stubbornly refusing to say? Excuse my bluntness, but that's really stupid. You're going to disagree with any interpretation of the first amendment that uses words that aren't in the first amendment? What does that leave but quoting it? You can do better than that. You're contradicting yourself here. Before you just wanted laws to not force you to be religious. Now you agree that even if a law doesn't force you to be religious, it can establish a religion, and is therefore no good. Great. Now, what was your guideline? Why were those hypothetical laws no good? I'm sticking with what I said before; they had no secular purpose, only religious. That's quite a hodge-podge there!

I'm sticking with what I already said, they are too much of an establishment. Just a response to YOUR hodge-podge of veils, fasting, and red meat.

I've been desperately trying to get you to say what the phrase means to you, and you've done nothing but dodge. Since you won't give me your actual words to address, you force me to address what you seem to be saying. I believe that you won't pin down a definition of ""seperation of church and state"" because you agree with my definition of it, you believe that that is what is intended in the first amendment, and you don't like it. You want your religious values given the weight of law. That's the reason for your perpetual dodging. No, quoting is a really, really horrible way of explaining what something means. It just means that you have decided on a meaning, but you're not going to share it. Again I'm left guessing, so here goes. You agree that the first amendment doesn't allow the government to pressure people's religious decisions, but you want them to. Specifically, you want the government to push your religion. But why? What makes them too much of an establishment? Since you won't define any terms I'm going to have to make a guess once again. A law is too much of an establishment if it establishes a religion you don't follow. If it espouses a religious view that you agree with, then it's fine. I've based these guesses on what you've said in this thread so far. Since you won't define your terms, that's all I have to go on. Don't like it? Don't agree with my assesment? Then define your terms! Until you're willing to take an actual stand on what you're trying to say, you force me to guess.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","11:21 PM","government-debates","71"
"08-16-2005","6149",5,"marc9000","None","Atheism is arguably a religion. As I showed above, science can't hope to prove that the universe began without a supernatural creator.

The assumption that there is no creator is not taught as fact, or in school. If it is taught that there is no creator, then they are just as guilty of violating the first ammendment as people trying to institute prayer in schools. The government isn't supposed to involve itself in religion either way. It can't say there is a god and it can't say there isn't. If you can show me where atheism is being taught in schools, I would be glad to see it, because I doubt it happens.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","10:21 PM","government-debates","72"

The life or condition of a person in a religious order. 3. A set of beliefs, values, and practices based on the teachings of a spiritual leader. 4.
