A third party doesn't have the right to terminate someone else's pregnancy forceably...hence double murder. And I'm pretty sure that's how the law works as well in many states, so while its my opinion (because I said so), there is also a basis for this legally.","Chuz Life","355198","""Pretty sure"" just isn't going to get it, CUNx. Some-one needs to explain how a woman can ""consent"" to have sex, risk pregnancy, create what you agree is a child WITH rights and then have the right themself to deny those rights to her child and to kill it for any reason she deems necessary; However, if and when someone else intentionally kills that same child?
