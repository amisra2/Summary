It's for all people in all places at all points in time. Liberal morality is subjective. It changes like people change their shorts. It's not enduring and seldom endearing. In the end, God rules. Liberals are an embarrassment and a scourge to humanity. They ought to be deported with a hefty, wallet clearing deportation tax placed on them.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","08:34 PM","government-debates","213"

It is outside of my morality to take punitive measures against those who disagree with me, but apparently for you it isn't. Personally I find the idea of everyone sharing my udeas/faith/culture/taste in music all rather dull. Welcome to the borg collective.... But, hey, you share the company of many despots Easy.

Hell, I don't even XXXX. I work, pay my taxes, and love my son. I simply do not share your religion or engage in your coward's hobby of condeming everyone who does not share the values of the individual I see in the mirror. As long as you aren't.

But here's something just for you: Dear American liberals, leftists, social progressives, socialists, race-baiters, Christ-deniers, gay flesh abusers, Marxists and Obama supporters, et al: Conservative Americans dont want to be associated with you dimwits anymore. Here is a model separation agreement: Our two groups can equitably divide up the country by landmass each taking a portion. You can have the areas you're currently bankrupting and we'll take the rest. We don't like redistributive tax schemes so you can keep those. You are welcome to the liberal judges, CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times (etc.) and the ACLU. Since you hate guns and war, we'll take our firearms, the cops, the NRA and the military. You can keep Oprah, Michael Moore, and Rosie O' Donnell (You are, however, responsible for finding a bio-diesel vehicle big enough to haul their radical, cellulite-infested carcasses away). We'll keep capitalism, greedy corporations, people who work for a living, pharmaceutical companies, Wal-Mart and Wall Street. You can have your cherished homeless, homeboys, addicts, hippies, perverts, Ward Churchill, and your beloved illegal aliens. We'll keep the hot Alaskan hockey moms, the NFL, greedy CEO's and rednecks. We'll also keep our Bibles and give you Hugo Chavez and Hollywood . You can make nice with Iran and Palestine and we'll retain the right to invade and hammer places like that when they threaten us. You can have the peaceniks, the yellow-bellied draft dodgers, and the uncouth, unwashed war protesters. When our allies or our way of life are under assault, we'll help provide them security. We'll keep our Judeo-Christian values. You are welcome to Islam, Scientology, Pig Latin, Saul Alinskys Rules for Radicals, Humanism, Al Gore, the nose pickers, the Kool Aid drinkers, and Shirley McClain. You can also have the U.N.. but we will no longer be paying the bill. We'll keep the SUVs, pickup trucks, Indy cars, Hot Rods and oversized luxury cars. You can have the Cash for Clunkers wrecks, all with Obama stickers. You can give everyone healthcare if you can find enough practicing doctors and nurses who will do it, and thats supposing you also will have some money to pay for it (knowing your government will be bankrupt in no time with all your drunken-sailor spending programs). We'll continue to earn our own healthcare. We'll keep The Battle Hymn of the Republic and the National Anthem. I'm sure you'll be happy to substitute Imagine, I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing, Kum Ba Ya, the Soviet National Anthem, or We Are the World. We'll practice trickle down economics and you can give your trickle up poverty your best shot. Since it often so offends you, we'll also keep our history, our name and our flag. More later. P.S. Oh yeah, please take Barbara Streisand, Harry Reid, Nanci Pelosi, Jessee Jackson, Al Sharpton, Barbara Boxer, Jane Fonda, Obama, and all the other radical, left wing loons with you. And don't come back.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","05:30 PM","government-debates","221"
