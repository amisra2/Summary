I suppose to privileged white men in the 50's those days would be missed but for everyone else it's a different story.... And Morality is subject to the believer... Government should not be influenced by anyone's faith period especially law... There is such a thing as separation of church and state. I myself am a person of faith, but I would never want my belief imposed on this entire country or it's elements because it defeats the true meaning of freedom and democracy.... There is a freedom of religion and a freedom FROM religion in this country...","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","08:32 PM","government-debates","206"
