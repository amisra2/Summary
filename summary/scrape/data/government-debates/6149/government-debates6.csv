To this question, it's this. ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of RELIGION or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"". Period, end of story. If I want to pray, pray. If I want to wear a yamaka, I should be able to wear one. If schools want to teach about creation (notice I didn't say creation science, because it is by defintion not a science), so be it. Follow it up with talk about other competing ""beliefs"". ""Origin of Species"" evolution isn't really a science either because it cannot be tested, so it's also a belief. But there are new adaptations of evolution which can be tested. Those are the only ones that can be taught in a science class. But I have to go back to the ""congress shall make no law bit."" I am, after all, a strict interpretionalist, and don't go in for the Supreme Court just making up things as they go along...like the supposed separation of church and state.

There is certainly no right to be free from exposure to religion, but I don't believe anyone is claiming that there is. However, there is a right to not be religious if one chooses, and to not have to live by other's religious standards. That's what I would call freedom from religion. As for the offended thing, I think that's a smokescreen, a strawman. Religious radicals have mined the papers searching for anyone saying that they're offended by such and such a religion, and are presenting these scattered examples as a mainstream argument supporting seperation of church and state. That's just silliness. The mainstream argument is that how I run my religious life should be my choice, not the governments.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","08:50 AM","government-debates","77"

Your right to practice or not to practice religion is and should be up to you and you alone, not the government. But when Christian values (and other religions use them, too) ""infiltrate"" government in the form of ""thou shalt not kill"", you don't get the right to not live by that standard and kill indescriminantly. Of course, murder is wrong. Where that come from is not the debate here. The 10 commandments has it in it. But being told not to kill is not preaching of Christianity. By that, it shouldn't matter that the 10 commandments are displayed because everybody believes it's wrong to kill. And just because there is a line in there about not having any other Gods before Me, there are no statutory laws that say that, so you don't have to believe that if you don't want to, and you won't be arrested if you don't.

The first is that we need to be able to distinguish Christian values, or any relgion's for that matter, from what you might call generic values. Simply because something appears in the BIble does not make it Christian, or at least not exclusively Christian. Some version of ""Thou shall not kill"" is found in most religions, and in most cultures. It's a basic tenant of any moral structure, and so does not ""belong"" to Christianity. And therefore having laws against killing in no way should be construed as endorsing a religious creedo. If you tried to have a law saying that you couldn't eat red meat on Friday, that would be a religious law. The second point you bring up concerns the government coercing people's religious choices. You speak of laws and arrests, and seem to suggest that their lack is sufficient to ensure freedom of religion. I would disagree. For people to really have religious freedom, they must believe that they have religious freedom. As a hypothetical example, if a government says you have religious freedom, but social services in an area where people of religion A lived were always better then in the religion B neighborhoods, and religion B people always seemed to lose in court, and religion A holidays were state holidays, but none of religion B, then you couldn't really say that there was religious freedom, right? There's definite pressure to be of religion A, even if there's no laws to that effect. This sort of thing has happened often enought throughout history that people are right to be concerned about it. And so it's not enough for our government to simply not pressure people, it's their responsibility to not give the appearance of pressuring people. And having a big old plaque in the middle of the courthouse saying ""worship this God and no other"" most definately gives the impression of pressure. It may not be forcing people by law to become Christians, but it does give the impression that the government prefers Judeo/Christianity, and if the people believe that the government is biased towards one religion then they won't feel as free to follow another.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","01:18 PM","government-debates","79"

I am, after all, a strict interpretionalist, and don't go in for the Supreme Court just making up things as they go along...like the supposed separation of church and state. ""Believing that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should make no law 'respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between church and state."" (President Thomas Jefferson, 1802 letter to the Baptists of Danbury, Connecticut) Because religious belief, or non-belief, is such an important part of every person's life, freedom of religion affects every individual. State churches that use government power to support themselves and force their views on persons of other faiths undermine all our civil rights. Moreover, state support of the church tends to make the clergy unresponsive to the people and leads to corruption within religion. Erecting the ""wall of separation between church and state,"" therefore, is absolutely essential in a free society. We have solved ... the great and interesting question whether freedom of religion is compatible with order in government and obedience to the laws. And we have experienced the quiet as well as the comfort which results from leaving every one to profess freely and openly those principles of religion which are the inductions of his own reason and the serious convictions of his own inquiries. (Thomas Jefferson, to the Virginia Baptists, 1808) This is his second use of the term ""wall of separation,"" here quoting his own use in the Danbury Baptist letter. This wording was several times upheld by the Supreme Court as an accurate description of the Establishment Clause: Reynolds (98 U.S. at 164, 1879); Everson (330 U.S. at 59, 1947); McCollum (333 U.S. at 232, 1948) http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/jefframe.htm The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg. -- Thomas Jefferson, Notes on the State of Virginia, 1781-82 http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/jefframe.htm [N]o man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities. -- Thomas Jefferson, Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom (1779), quoted from Merrill D. Peterson, ed., Thomas Jefferson: Writings (1984), p. 347 http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/jefframe.htm Our civil rights have no dependence upon our religious opinions more than our opinions in physics or geometry. -- Thomas Jefferson, Statute for Religious Freedom, 1779. Papers, 2:545 http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/jefframe.htm Encourage free schools and resolve that not one dollar appropriated for their support shall be appropriated to the support of any sectarian schools. Resolve that neither the state nor nation, nor both combined, shall support institutions of learning other than those sufficient to afford every child growing up in the land of opportunity of a good common school education, unmixed with sectarian, pagan, or atheistical dogmas. Leave the matter of religion to the family altar, the church and the private school supported entirely by private contributions. Keep the church and state forever separate. -- Ulysses S. Grant, address to the Army of the Tennessee, Des Moines, Iowa, September 25, 1875, from Albert J. Menendez and Edd Doerr, The Great Quotations on Religious Freedom http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/jefframe.htm","DamEtel","156063","So you don't know science. Maybe they should have spent more time teaching it when you were in school. Okay, so you don't know science or about the founding fathers' statements about the Constitution. Do you really think that the Supreme Court just made up ""separation of church and state""? Really? No. Thomas Jefferson was asked by a religious group to explain a bit more about the First Ammendment, and part of his response was ... Do you see Jefferson's explicit link between the First Ammendment and the separation between church and state? Can you see that he is explaining the intent of the establishment clause? Oh, and Jefferson mentioned the separation of church and state on more than one occassion ... ******************************** Here, let me give you a bit more on Jefferson's views on separation of church and state. And though not one of the founding fathers, we have the separation of church and state mentioned by other historical figures.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","12:20 AM","government-debates","81"

It was established 11 years before Jefferson wrote his letter to the Danbury Baptists, which was nothing more than a short note of courtesy. Jefferson was one of the most secular of all the founders. He didn't have authority to make changes in wording and interpretation of the country's foundation, and I don't think he wanted to. Grant's accomplishments, (or lack of them) don't make his words one bit more significant than countless other forgotten politicians.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","09:21 AM","government-debates","82"
"08-21-2005","6149",6,"DamEtel","None","Wrong. It was an explanation of the establishment clause, helping to clarify its intent. Gee, now do you think that that might be why the Supreme Court has used Jefferson's statements about building a wall of separation between church and state as their means of understanding the intent of the establishment clause? Huh? And if you'll note, again, Jefferson repeated his phrase ""wall of separation between church and state"" in another letter to a religious group to help explain the intent. Now, is there anything else about the Constitution that helps confirm that it's a secular document, meant to separate church and state? Yep. First, neither the word God nor the word Jesus appear anywhere in either the Constitution or the Bill of Rights. It's a secular document. This is important because it was the first time that a national government was founded without promoting a state religion. You'd have to understand how out of place for the time a secular Constitution really was to understand the importance of leaving God and Jesus out such an important document; and how doing so clearly shows an intent to not go along with the then universal act of mixing church and state. Second, the only references to religion in the Constitution and the Bill of Right are EXCLUSIONARY. One forbids the government from mandating religious 'tests' in order for someone to serve as a public official. For a bit of context, Delaware was requiring a person to swear an oath that he believed in the Holy Trinity in order to hold a public office, and other states had similar religious requirements for holding government offices. Jefferson and the other founders of our nation said that they would have none of that - which mixes church and state - for the national goverment. The other is, of course, the First Ammendmant, which forbids -- not allows -- the government from doing certain things related to religion. You would need to know the historical context - the conditions prevailing in that day - to know just how anti-status quo this was too, and how therefore just by saying ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; . . ."" showed that the intention was to do away with the then universal union of church and state. Now, it is EVERYONE who ratified the Constitution and agreed to the Bill of Rights - not just Jefferson - who understood, because of the obvious change from the status quo that was in place at the time, that the documents were meant to do away with the then standard practice of mixing church and state, and therefore, to separate church and state. And yet, funny enough, it wasn't Jefferson alone who made the Constitution our governing document, seeing as how every state ratified the SECULAR Constitution. And he didn't change anything! He EXPLAINED the INTENT. That's not changing the wording of the Constitution, nor is it changing the interpretation. Quite the opposite. Any Supreme Court justice who interprets the First Ammendent as other than intending to build a wall of separation between church and state is the one who is changing the intent of it. Uhm, pay attention to context. The person I was responding to thought that the Supreme Court just made up this notion of ""separation of church and state"", and my quotes of Jefferson - and Grant - showed him to be wrong. Look, I'm sorry if you don't like the fact that our nation was founded on a secular document, part of which was intended to build a wall of separation between church and state ... but if you despise this government's very foundations so much, you can always move to a country that was founded on a state religion ... like one in the middle east.","marc9000","156099","Gee, I don't think so. Because they waited 150 years to even think much about it. Can you cite any examples of political battles over ""separation of church & state"" before the last 60 years? Why do you suppose George Washington's proclaimation of Thanksgiving day went politically unchallanged? Was Jefferson the only one entrusted with interpreting the Constitution for us? Any comments on the Thanksgiving day holiday? How about Jefferson's treaty with the Kaskaskia Indians, which provided annual cash support for the tribe's Roman Catholic Priest and church? Congress appropraited public money time and time again for Indian education carried on by religious organizations, in the 19th century. Why is all this ""separation of church & state"" outcry happening only today? Then why are those words not in there - EVERYONE who ratified it DID NOT SEE those words. And yet, funny enough, without the words ""separation of church & state"". It can be when you add words, that are not in the text. No, the ones intent on changing it are the ones who ADD WORDS, not ones who leave the wording as it is. Well they didn't make them up, but they sure had to XXXX the dust off of a lot of trivial, forgotten documentation to find them. Those who claim to be loyal to the foundation of this country seem to be very particular about what parts of the foundation they want to address. They want to add words in some places, and disregard actual text in others. Several phrases come to mind; ""...shall not be infringed"" ""...probable cause.....particularly describing the place to be searched..."" ""...shall not be taken for public use without just compensation."" ""...nor execssive fines imposed..."" (ever hear of Merck Pharmaceuticals?) ""...are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people."" Many originalists think that paying almost no attention to the above actual text is far more dangerous to the health of our country than separating church & state. Are these no longer relavent? Are you really an originalist, or are you a non-originalist (activist), as almost all of the ""separation of church & state"" crowd are? I don't think you're on very firm footing to advise other people to move.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","03:28 PM","government-debates","84"

How they go about doing it determines the success and consequences. Things may be taught and learned in the schools, but do the youth learning these things accept what is taught? No, and last i checked the local schools taught conflicting theories on creationism/evolutionism etc., etc. and were to make clear that all of the things taught are theories and/or beliefs and were unable to say anything more. I have heard that where you live determines how you live and i think that is true. Those who work to run countries have influence on the societal values. Abortion, gay rights, and many of the 'hot' issues are moral issues which each individual should have the right to choose for themselves what actions they take. This isnt meant to be a rambling lecture honestly. I have noticed the ever increasing instances of Christian beliefs in everyday life. Seperation of church and state has become a fragile grey line. it is up to each person in how they live each day to make thier views known without monopolizing society. I have my beliefs and will share them but i believe that each person has the right to make choices for themselves according to what they believe, not what i believe. Openmindedness is becoming increasingly scarce. Most people do not take kindly to everything they do being checked and restricted because of someone elses beliefs. Before you try to go around 'converting' people imagine what your reaction would be.
