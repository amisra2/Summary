Why is the christians religious freedom more important then those who wish to be left alone and not wish to particpate in christian activities? Do you mean the people who want to be free of having their children forced to stand and patipate in christian prayers? It seems to me that christians want the freedom to practice their religion any where any time, in any ones face, have the government sponsor christian activities, and make laws to enforce their brand of morality. Then when someone complains that they don't want to have to watch, participate, or have the government, which they pay taxes to support, force them to live by a christian set of morals and sue. The christians feel that their religion is under attack when it wouldn't be if they kept their religion in their churches and homes and out of peoples faces in the first place.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","08:26 AM","government-debates","7"

If you disagree, if you really think there is such a movement, then please show me any evidence you have that it's real, I'd love to see it. And please note that scattered incidents don't qualify as a movement. Please show evidence of a co-ordinated effort, and if you can spell out exactly what this movements goals precisely are. As for seperation of church and state not being in the Consititution, of course it is, as I'm sure you well know. Not using those exact words of course, but that's what's guaranteed in the first amendment.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","01:18 PM","government-debates","8"

But the way it's interpreted now, the 14th ammendment means, in effect, that the states also cannot establish religion. If there was originally meant to be a true seperation of church and state, then the establishment clause would have read more like the other ammendments in the bill of rights. For instance, the 4th ammendment: ""The right of the people... shall not be violated..."" If there was originally intended to be a solid seperation of church and state then the establishment clause would have read something more like: ""The right to free exercise of religion shall not be abrigded...""","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","02:50 PM","government-debates","13"

All of the amendments in the Bill of Rights use slightly different turns of phrase; I really don't think the intention there was to say that they really really meant it with some of the amendments, and only sort of meant it on others, based soley on subtelties of wording.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","03:26 PM","government-debates","14"

Establishment clause: - The government cannot require you to join a particular religion, nor can they adopt a state religion. Both clauses are a restriction on the activities of the government. The Constitution's purpose is to limit government's ability. It has no effect on entities outside of the government. The Constution very well could have stated that the church and government could, in no way, interfere with eachother. However, this would have resulted in some fairly absurd results, and religions would have nearly complete freedom to do whatever they want without fear of government intervention.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","06:36 PM","government-debates","15"
