If you try to tell off any christian person, 500 christian people will come to ""cleanse"" your soul. My school teaches ID in its curriculum even though though its not suppose to be there. the teachers just simply drop it into the evolution chapter. Even after i complain to the vice principal, all he said is "" hey kid this is texas...nothing you can do about."" What I did was debate my teacher in the subject of evolution vs ID. In the end i won the debate but he won the argument by giving me detention.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","07:45 PM","government-debates","16"

I live in small town Delaware, and whenever I would raise objections to christianity people would immediately bite my head off.

"08-09-2005","6149",2,"Kronus","None","There is no anti-Christian movement; that's a myth generated by the religious right to justify their efforts to force their beliefs on others. If you disagree, if you really think there is such a movement, then please show me any evidence you have that it's real, I'd love to see it. And please note that scattered incidents don't qualify as a movement. Please show evidence of a co-ordinated effort, and if you can spell out exactly what this movements goals precisely are. As for seperation of church and state not being in the Consititution, of course it is, as I'm sure you well know. Not using those exact words of course, but that's what's guaranteed in the first amendment.","marc9000","153984","I think the ""movements"" don't attempt to identify themselves as anti-Christian or satanic, they simply try to invoke activities into our society that have never traditionally been there, to cheapen Christianity. Things like state lotteries, casino gambling, gay marriage, smut on the internet and cable television - all things that were all but completely absent ""20 years ago"". ""Movements and goals"" that go back a little further than 20 years would be Hollywood and the music industry's largely subliminal jabs at things like parental authority and morals in general. Those exact words were written by Thomas Jefferson to the Danbuy Baptists in 1802, and have been debated and discussed ever since. A few liberal Supreme Court justices along with our liberal news media have done an amazing job of convincing many uninformed people that they are in the Constitution.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","09:52 PM","government-debates","18"
"08-09-2005","6149",2,"georged","None","I'm not a member of any bar but in contract law congress being restrained from legislation of religious establishment (to condone) and prohibition of religious exercise is very effective separation between religion and state. As most of the founding fathers were dietists with a few agnostics, I can't even imagine agreement among them to combine government with mythical belief systems.","marc9000","153988","Can you imagine the first president proclaiming a national day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God within days of the vote on the Bill of Rights? Why didn't all these ""diests"" object? Can you imagine the very effective separation between religion and state originally applying ONLY to Congress, and not to the states? They did not prohibit states from establishing religions, and several of them did. That has changed since the days of all those ""diests"", and I think it's a good thing. You'd think athiests would be satisfied with that. But it seems that those who seek to destroy Christianity are never satisfied.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","10:04 PM","government-debates","19"
"08-09-2005","6149",2,"biccat","None","Free exercise clause: - The government cannot pass laws, for example, prohibiting people from wearing symbols of their religious beliefs, such as a cross, burqa, or pentagram. Establishment clause: - The government cannot require you to join a particular religion, nor can they adopt a state religion. Both clauses are a restriction on the activities of the government. The Constitution's purpose is to limit government's ability. It has no effect on entities outside of the government. The Constution very well could have stated that the church and government could, in no way, interfere with eachother. However, this would have resulted in some fairly absurd results, and religions would have nearly complete freedom to do whatever they want without fear of government intervention.","Kronus","154015","We seem to agree that the free excercise clause means that the government can't mess with religion. The establishment clause, while it does do what you say, also means that the government can't make laws based solely on religion. They can not, for example, pass a law forbidding you to take the lord's name in vain, or forbidding you to eat pork, or requiring that women wear veils. Laws must have a secular purpose, they can't be solely religious. That's what I meant when I said that religion can't mess with government. Clearly the seperation wasn't meant to be absolute, any more than freedom of speech means you can yell fire in a theater, or the right to bear arms means you can own a nuke. Common sense still applies; you can't kill someone and say that your religion demands human sacrifice, for example. The fact that the seperation wasn't meant to be absolute doesn't mean that it wasn't meant to be. Like everything else in the Bill of Rights it's meant to be taken seriously, but tempered with common sense.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","11:35 PM","government-debates","20"

And it certainly isn't anti-christian. That's just people living their lives the way they choose to. Don't like lotteries? Then don't play them. Don't subscribe to cable if you don't like what's on there. Absolutely nothing you describe prevents you from following your religion in the way that you wish. It only means that others aren't living their lives in the way that you would wish. And that's the way it should be. Just as no one should tell you to stop acting the way you feel your religion requires, you shouldn't expect people to live a certain way, based on your beliefs. People may not be following your religious standards, but that isn't an attack on Christianity. As long as you personally can follow your religion then talk of an anti-christian movement is just scare tactics. There's no liberal conspiracy to make people think those words are in the Constitution! That's just silliness. The concept is in there, that's clear. And given that the concept is there what would be the point of this campaign to fool people into thinking that the actual words are there?","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","11:47 PM","government-debates","21"
"08-10-2005","6149",2,"None","None","None","Big_Bear_Scot","154051","I don't understand all the fuss about separation between State and Religion, in the UK our Head of State is also the Head of the Church of England. The Bishops in the Church of England are appointed by Royal Prerogative by the Prime Minister . Also those Bishops then can sit in the House of Lords, which is our Upper Chamber which revises and scrutinises bills created in the House of Commons. So in effect the State Religion has a say in the passage of Laws in my Country. Now I am not entirely happy about Unelected Bishops having a say in the running of the Country, but I have seen no evidence of Christians forcing their views on the population of the UK. I am more unhappy that the second chamber is unelected than Bishops of Church England siting in it.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","04:43 AM","government-debates","22"

"08-10-2005","6149",2,"Matthew S","None","What are these groups? Why is the christians religious freedom more important then those who wish to be left alone and not wish to particpate in christian activities? Do you mean the people who want to be free of having their children forced to stand and patipate in christian prayers? It seems to me that christians want the freedom to practice their religion any where any time, in any ones face, have the government sponsor christian activities, and make laws to enforce their brand of morality. Then when someone complains that they don't want to have to watch, participate, or have the government, which they pay taxes to support, force them to live by a christian set of morals and sue. The christians feel that their religion is under attack when it wouldn't be if they kept their religion in their churches and homes and out of peoples faces in the first place.","zachvac","154090","What they are doing is fine up to the point where the government sponsors it. They may ""practice their religion any where any time, in any ones face"" as long as it doesn't impede on anyone else's rights. So burning someone to the stake in the name of religion is clearly violating the right to life. The problem is that the entire country pays money to the government in the form of taxes and these taxes shouldn't be used to sponsor religion. This is a representative democracy, and I don't like it when the people representing me publicly denounce my religious views (when they say ""in God we trust"" and such) If they would keep religion in the churches where they belong, that would be ideal. Even if they want to take it into public, that's fine too. But we draw the line at government, that was made clear in the very first amendment of the Constitution. Religion doesn't belong in government.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","10:55 AM","government-debates","25"

We prohibit murder because it's morally wrong. We prohibit prostitution for a similar reason. The modern trend is towards a secular humanist morality, as opposed to the traditional Christian morality. A good question would be: why do we permit a secular humanist morality to drive our laws, but ban Christian laws on the basis of ""separation of church and state""?","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","11:35 AM","government-debates","28"

Aside from armed rebellion of course. Morals can be, and often are, secular. People are capable of telling right from wrong without having to base their reasoning on ""God said so."" For example, some of the secular purposes behind prohibiting murder are that if murder were allowed chaos would ensue, and nobody wants to be murdered and so it shouldn't be allowed. That's an easy one. If a person comes up and says ""I think such and such is wrong, and here are my reasons."" you can examine those reasons, discuss them, and if you don't fully agree then perhaps a compromise postion can be found. If someone say ""I think such and such is wrong , because God said so."" then there's no room for debate or compromise, you either believe in that God and in that person's interpretation of that God's will or you don't. If you try to base laws on religion then you either force everyone to follow the same religion or nothing gets done. If you base laws on secular reasoning than you can have honest debate and actually get some good law written.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","12:03 PM","government-debates","29"

Why do medical researchers have an ethical code that prohibits experiments on humans except in carefully controlled situations? The fact is that there is an underlying morality, based on more than weighing the pros and cons of a certain course of action.
