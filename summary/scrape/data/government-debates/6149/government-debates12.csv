"05-24-2009","6149",12,"Chuz Life","354866","Wrong, CUNx... I have no religious basis for my views on abortion. How many posts would you like for me to link you to where I have fought against the injection of religion into the issue? Question,.. if abortion is not a denial of a child's rights,.. what is so ""horrid"" about it? If it's only about the rights and freedoms of the woman (as you claim),.. why wouldn't an abortion be cause for celebration? Ahh I digress,... the race is about to start!","Collin","354907","Just because a tree has no rights and you're free to cut it down without it ever feeling any pain doesn't mean it's a cause for celebration whenever someone cuts down a tree. Yeesh, talk about a strange dichotomy.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","07:44 PM","government-debates","166"

Is it generally considered to be ""horrid"" when someone cuts down a tree?","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","11:48 PM","government-debates","167"

If anything, we have overpopulation in many regions,... so why then would it be considered ""horrid"" by someone like CUNx,.... for a woman to abort an assumed to be ""non-person"" hinderence to her life, health and well being? CUNx said it was ""horrid"" and I think we all know the true reason why .","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","01:17 PM","government-debates","169"
"05-25-2009","6149",12,"None","None","None","CUNxTime","354984","It's horrid because it ends possibilities and causes trauma the those who have them (and potentially their partner). Not many people 'celebrate' abortions. But a woman has a right to control her body.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","08:35 PM","government-debates","170"

If someone murders a preg. woman, I think they should be charged with double murder.

I'm not as blind to say the baby isn't alive until birth (or 3rd trimester, or whatever). I feel though the mother has a RIGHT to chose how to use her body.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","10:32 AM","government-debates","176"
"05-27-2009","6149",12,"Chuz Life","355059","Again, you dodge the question and instead answer one that I didn't ask. So, I'll ask one more time with the follow up question of ""how do you think it makes you look when you have to avoid direct questions by giving evasive answers this way?"" CUNX, ""Do you believe a child's basic rights should begin when their life does?"" Yes or no. For reference; I can't imagine how you can conceive (per your comments in that earlier post) that killing a pregnant woman can be prosecuted as ""TWO MURDERS ;"" Yet, the ""murdered"" (your word) pre-birth child had no rights to be violated ?!? Do you care enough to explain how that works?","CUNxTime","355192","I think I've been pretty clear... but I'll try again. The mother's right to control her body supersede any rights the baby has. The mother has the right to bring her baby to term or she has the right to terminate in the early stages of pregnancy.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","09:50 AM","government-debates","178"

How can you ""murder"" a child that has no rights? You have not explained how this can be. Please be clear on the Constitutional basis for claiming that when a stranger kills the baby it's MURDER,... but when the mother kills the baby (for any reason she wants) it's not. Sorry, but I need something more than ""because I said so.""","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","10:00 AM","government-debates","179"

A third party doesn't have the right to terminate someone else's pregnancy forceably...hence double murder. And I'm pretty sure that's how the law works as well in many states, so while its my opinion (because I said so), there is also a basis for this legally.","dag-nabbit-does-seperation-church-state-mean-anything-anymore","10:05 AM","government-debates","180"
