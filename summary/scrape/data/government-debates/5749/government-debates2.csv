Discrimination Gay people are currently being denied the protections against discrimination, and the right to marry by people who wrap themselves in the flag and who are now tring to pass this admendment.

But why make the US flag synonymous w/censorship, and the very thing the US is NOT supposed to represent? Perhaps it is the failing of education, because I cannot remember a time in my childhood where this would have even been considered, let alone passing a part of Congress. Let's hope that the people give this a resounding defeat if it ever makes the state voting ballots.","house-approves-flag-desecration-ban","09:30 AM","government-debates","17"

Flags are emotive. The Nazi flag is unwelcome to some. The Confederate Flag is unwelcome to some. The rainbow flag is unwelcome to some. A lot of flags evoke anger. This has little to do with a demand to respect a certain flag. I could just as easily invision congress passing a law that says we cannot desecrate the Nazi flag....to which I would say ""screw you, congress"". Somehow I knew this issue would be stitched into this argument about the burning of the flag. This has absolutely nothing to do with same sex unions or gay people in general. I imagine that the gay-bashers wrap themselves more often in selected pages of the Bible than in the American Flag. Get serious! You have stated your opinion. You haven't ""made"" any points, valid or not. The American Flag is not in general such a symbol as you describe. I agree that some lesser educated people might agree with you, but you'll not find enough support for your theory to wad a 20 gauge shotgun!","house-approves-flag-desecration-ban","10:03 AM","government-debates","18"

Am I free to marry another man? I don't understand are you saying that it is my opinion that native americans were murdered by soldiers carring american flags? are you saying I pulled the facts out of thin air? Ask a dying native american child bleeding at sand creek to death as last thing he sees is an american flag what he thinks. Are you saying it is my opinion that the government of the united states under the flag allowed slavery? Ask a runaway slave as he watches the us millitary carring the flag as he is returned to slavery what he thinks. Are you saying it is my opinion that japanese americans were intered in camps? Are you saying that it is my opinion that there were american flags flying on the gates in the new reels? Ask a japanese american how he feels as he sees the flag though the barbed wire of the internment camp what he thinks. I guess I made all this up. I never said I support any such action as you suggest, I am just pointing out that not all people see the flag through the eyes of a white heterosexual male.","house-approves-flag-desecration-ban","08:34 PM","government-debates","19"
