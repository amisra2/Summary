Making it against the law to desecrate anything other than someone else's property is ridiculous, IMHO. The next amendment will be to outlaw the burning in effigy of our public officials. Then will come an amendment to outlaw wearing a Richard Nixon mask in the commission of a felony. Then will come an amendment outlawing any derogatory talk about the government. Then will come a little lapel pin that every citizen must wear or risk being shot on sight. There's a point at which this ""I'll protect the flag"" syndrome becomes destructive. Patriotism should not be forced, lest it be insincere.","house-approves-flag-desecration-ban","12:37 PM","government-debates","11"

To many people it is an imperial symbol, a symbol of arrogance, oppression, and a disregard for the lives of its victims. If you want your flag to stand for freedom, then it must stand for freedom to, ultimately, do things that the US doesn't like. The US view of freedom seems to me something like that of Shift the ape from C.S. Lewis' The Last Battle: ""Freedom doesn't mean doing what you want, it means doing what I tell you to do!""","house-approves-flag-desecration-ban","12:45 PM","government-debates","12"

It is not 'anything you want, EXCEPT this, and this, and that...'. Making an amendment restricting the very freedom our flag represents lessens it. I have no compunction to desecrate a flag, and will never give any heed to those that do, but if this amendment gets ratified by the states, I will stop flying our colors.

But why make the US flag synonymous w/censorship, and the very thing the US is NOT supposed to represent? Perhaps it is the failing of education, because I cannot remember a time in my childhood where this would have even been considered, let alone passing a part of Congress. Let's hope that the people give this a resounding defeat if it ever makes the state voting ballots.","house-approves-flag-desecration-ban","09:30 AM","government-debates","17"

Flags are emotive. The Nazi flag is unwelcome to some. The Confederate Flag is unwelcome to some. The rainbow flag is unwelcome to some. A lot of flags evoke anger. This has little to do with a demand to respect a certain flag. I could just as easily invision congress passing a law that says we cannot desecrate the Nazi flag....to which I would say ""screw you, congress"". Somehow I knew this issue would be stitched into this argument about the burning of the flag. This has absolutely nothing to do with same sex unions or gay people in general. I imagine that the gay-bashers wrap themselves more often in selected pages of the Bible than in the American Flag. Get serious! You have stated your opinion. You haven't ""made"" any points, valid or not. The American Flag is not in general such a symbol as you describe. I agree that some lesser educated people might agree with you, but you'll not find enough support for your theory to wad a 20 gauge shotgun!","house-approves-flag-desecration-ban","10:03 AM","government-debates","18"

Am I free to marry another man? I don't understand are you saying that it is my opinion that native americans were murdered by soldiers carring american flags? are you saying I pulled the facts out of thin air? Ask a dying native american child bleeding at sand creek to death as last thing he sees is an american flag what he thinks. Are you saying it is my opinion that the government of the united states under the flag allowed slavery? Ask a runaway slave as he watches the us millitary carring the flag as he is returned to slavery what he thinks. Are you saying it is my opinion that japanese americans were intered in camps? Are you saying that it is my opinion that there were american flags flying on the gates in the new reels? Ask a japanese american how he feels as he sees the flag though the barbed wire of the internment camp what he thinks. I guess I made all this up. I never said I support any such action as you suggest, I am just pointing out that not all people see the flag through the eyes of a white heterosexual male.","house-approves-flag-desecration-ban","08:34 PM","government-debates","19"
