Medicare is on its 5-10 year march to absolute bankruptcy, AIDs is infected more americans then ever before, fewer and fewer hospitals are opening, and a number are closing, doctors are leaving large regions without professional medical care, Osama Bin Laden could be slipping a nuke into New York harbor NOW.

If somehow this piece of garbage gets through the Senate, look for the gayrriage ban amendment to come next. And never a hint of the Balanced Budget Amendment (that they promised about a decade ago), tax reform, immigration control reform, Medicare reform, or education reform.","house-approves-flag-desecration-ban","07:49 AM","government-debates","3"

Heck, I don't care if it's a plastic flag or one your kid drew and stuck on the refrigerator. It's the message you are trying to get across.","Truthsayer","140357","As I said in another thread addressing this topic. Please refer to that thread for my opinion should anyone be interested.

Making it against the law to desecrate anything other than someone else's property is ridiculous, IMHO. The next amendment will be to outlaw the burning in effigy of our public officials. Then will come an amendment to outlaw wearing a Richard Nixon mask in the commission of a felony. Then will come an amendment outlawing any derogatory talk about the government. Then will come a little lapel pin that every citizen must wear or risk being shot on sight. There's a point at which this ""I'll protect the flag"" syndrome becomes destructive. Patriotism should not be forced, lest it be insincere.","house-approves-flag-desecration-ban","12:37 PM","government-debates","11"

To many people it is an imperial symbol, a symbol of arrogance, oppression, and a disregard for the lives of its victims. If you want your flag to stand for freedom, then it must stand for freedom to, ultimately, do things that the US doesn't like. The US view of freedom seems to me something like that of Shift the ape from C.S. Lewis' The Last Battle: ""Freedom doesn't mean doing what you want, it means doing what I tell you to do!""","house-approves-flag-desecration-ban","12:45 PM","government-debates","12"

It is not 'anything you want, EXCEPT this, and this, and that...'. Making an amendment restricting the very freedom our flag represents lessens it. I have no compunction to desecrate a flag, and will never give any heed to those that do, but if this amendment gets ratified by the states, I will stop flying our colors. Because America will have died on that day. Replaced by Amerika.","house-approves-flag-desecration-ban","02:07 PM","government-debates","13"
