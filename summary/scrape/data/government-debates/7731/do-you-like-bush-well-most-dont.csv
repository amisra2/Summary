There are people who approve of him? I thought polls were plus or minus 3 points. Even fuzzy math would put him at 0.","do-you-like-bush-well-most-dont","09:42 PM","government-debates","7"

It is almost like they are tired of looking stupid every time they argue in favor of pretty much anything Bush supports. I rememebr in the lead up to the Iraq war that anybody who suggested that our motives were anything other than pure as the driven snow was immediatly mobbed by ignorant, propoganda weilding, pro bush XXXXXX. There have been several threads here suggesting that the Iran situation is essentially BS. Not a single person has stepped up to defend the neocons position.","do-you-like-bush-well-most-dont","11:40 PM","government-debates","9"

If they happen to mine a few high-traffic areas, or launch a few missles at some super-tankers, which they have threatened to do, people will see the real threat. Iran seems to be saying "" don't tell on me or I'll do it."" How do we negotiate with people who aren't logical thinkers? Maybe Bush can be effective in dealing with Iran. He isn't a logical thinker either. Something tells me he could screw this one up too.","do-you-like-bush-well-most-dont","06:33 AM","government-debates","10"

If directly attacked, the revenue lost due to decreased oil transport capacity becomes a moot point, leaving them with no reason NOT to shut down the gulf. There is simply no military solution regarding Iran. We have 130,000 troops well within range of their missiles, only a small percentage of which would actually have to reach their target to wipe out US presence in the ME. 2 strategically sunk tankers, well within Irans capability, would close down the persian gulf completely. Just the effect on the world economy of decreased or (gasp) halted iranian exports would be devestating.","do-you-like-bush-well-most-dont","01:09 PM","government-debates","14"
