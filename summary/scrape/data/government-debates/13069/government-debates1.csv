Afterall, the CBO and factcheck.org already debunked a lot of their BS. But yes, that does seem a little fishy in and of itself.","big-brother-should-we-concerned","09:25 AM","government-debates","3"
"08-05-2009","13069",1,"CUNxTime","363972","Apparently, the white house has set up a website where we can report each other for spreading misinformation about the Healthcare bill. On the Whitehouse Website... The White House - Blog Post - Facts Are Stubborn Things What exactly is this for? Are they taking names or are they just trying to fix misconceptions about what's actually in the bill? It concerns me when our govt. begins asking citizens to begin monitoring each other and sending the names in. It would concern me regardless of what the topic was.","Archangel","364078","Here is a perfect example ONCE AGAIN of the double standards and blatant hypocrisy which defines the Liberal Left at every single level of rationale. REMEMBER WHEN they accused Bush of destroying the privacy rights of americans for allowing Homeland Security to monitor calls between suspected terrorists and americans as long as one of the parties was over seas? This attempt to intercept calls by possible enemies of the State was defined as fascism and an invasion of our privacy by the Left. But here we have a tax payer funded web site created by the government which is encouraging one american to report another american citizen just because that american IN THE EXERCISING OF HIS RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH OPPOSES THIS PRESIDENTS HELLCARE PROGRAM WHICH CONTENTS WE ARE BEING LIED ABOUT AT EVERY TURN. How dare we conservatives organize an opposition force to inform the american people about the lies and distortions this program is rife with. Our community organizing president who is giving speeches to rally his liberal troops is calling the american opponents who are also organizing in order to oppose his fascist programs are all of a sudden dangerous kooks and crackpots. It's like I've always said, The leftists believe in free speech as long as we dare not disagree with their version of the events being discussed. He says that he wont force anyone to buy into his program, but he fails to tell us that anyone who doesn't buy into it will receive a year end penalty equal to the amount of the Governments annual program cost. He says now that he wont force a single payer system on us but in 03 he said that the single payer program was his goal. If his plan is so good for all americans, then why isn't Congress going to adopt it also? It's good enough for the surfs, but not the elite's.","big-brother-should-we-concerned","04:55 PM","government-debates","4"

Well, I can't wait to be enlightened... How is covertly listening in on private conversations NOT an invasion of privacy? What we have here, as far as I can see, is a web site encouraging people to report questions, concerns, and misinformation so that it can be addressed instead of ###### like you spreading it as gospel. Feel free to do so, no one's saying you can't. Just actually report FACTS. I know you have no idea what that word means, but some do. Now he's a fascist? I thought he was a communist. You ARE a dangerous kook and crackpot Archie. You say lots of things. As with this, most of them are lies or idiocy. Great, see, now if you can back that up with actual sources and figures, you'd have a FACT. And god knows politicians NEVER change their goals once elected... Then you'd be screaming about how much more THAT would cost...","big-brother-should-we-concerned","06:02 PM","government-debates","5"

Back on topic- I don't agree with reporting people's names, email addresses, personal info of any kind. But I can see the advantage of reporting misinformation so that it can be corrected. I see the advantage in making sure people are making an educated decision, rather than one based on partisan rumours and fear mongering. If this is the case, seems like a good, cheap way to see what kind of misinformation is floating aroung, collect it, and address it.","big-brother-should-we-concerned","07:21 PM","government-debates","7"

Of course the govt. is a huge entity and its hard to imagine them taking the time to vindictively go after some small potatoes (however, dropping someone's name to the IRS for an Audit isn't that hard lol). Its just strikes me as weird that they want you to send in a private email, seems to me they'd just address anything they want on an open website and be done with it. The other question is, how can we know that the info THEY are giving out is unbiased and neutral? I mean, they obviously have a stake in their plan. Why should we suspend disbelief for them... even if someone's on my 'side' I'll still look critically at any plan they have that will affect me.","big-brother-should-we-concerned","10:28 PM","government-debates","8"

Like you said, if someone wanted to report someone else to have them harassed by the government, could they not just put in an anonymous call to the IRS and say ""Don't you think it's odd that my neighbour says he delivers newspapers for a living, but lives in a 10 bedroom mansion with a big swimming pool? Where do you think he gets that money from?"" Or call social services and say ""My kid has a classmate who comes to school with bruises all the time, and he says he falls down the stairs. Seems to me the kid is a little too much of a clutz, if you get what I'm saying..."" Point being, if you wanted to get someone in trouble with the government, there are lots of easier ways to do it already available. Same way you know anything the government tells you is unbiased and neutral Who's asking anyone to suspend disbelief? All I'm saying is you have people like Archie running around screaming that Obama is going to enslave you for reason x,y and z. You send in an email saying ""I heard x, y, and z. Is that true?"" And you have the white house, in a press briefing or on the web site say ""Some people have said x, y, and z. That's incorrect, and here's why"", rather than having people believe whatever rumour catches their fancy.","big-brother-should-we-concerned","11:27 PM","government-debates","9"
"08-06-2009","13069",1,"None","None","None","Archangel","364227","Here is another example of the character of Pelosi as she accuses those who speak out against this government take over of healthcare as Nazis. I would challenge anyone to show one person from these town hall meetings who was wearing a swastika. And btw, what kind of health care did Nazi Germany offer its select citizens who qualified for it? It was Nationalized Healthcare. And didn't Nazi Germany require the loyal citizens to report those who were disloyal to the Nationalist Socialist Program? That is why I suggested the that this administration is starting to smell like a fascist state in the heavy handed policies it is attempting to force on us without even debating them or considering the long term repercussions which they represent. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGRUx2b0ArM And I invite any and all of your militant leftists to report me to this white house rat link, as I invite and welcome the scrutiny of what is left of my government","big-brother-should-we-concerned","10:59 AM","government-debates","10"

If it is really so beneficial, Obama shouldn't have to lie about it. Nor should they have to use such heavy handed tactics and intimidate people from speaking out in a free country.","big-brother-should-we-concerned","12:11 PM","government-debates","12"

Bush and Cheney already had all our names and information filed away and all Obama has to do is to go into these files and find out anything he wants to know about us. Geesh! Get a grip! We've been spied on for years by the busy little Bush/Cheneyniks. It's annoying to be sure, but when my daughters and I spoke over the phone we always felt sorry for the poor sot who had to listen to our boring conversations so we always tried to toss in little jokes to make their lives easier.","big-brother-should-we-concerned","02:13 PM","government-debates","15"
