What heavy handed tactics?","Archangel","364290","They fein outrage at the fact that americans are actually speaking out and asking questions where no rational answers exist. They are insulted that we aren't just lying down and accepting their forcing of this legislation down our throats and are attacking the Right for organizing communities against them when this president is himself a community organizer and has called for those on the left to come together and get in our faces and shout us down if we continue to oppose what he is attempting to force on us. And he is attempting to force this on us. If he is truly representing all of the people with such an important and expensive issue, he should care about what we want and care about creating an equitable system which wont bankrupt this and the generations to come for the foreseeable future. This hell-plan will complete his agenda to create a true class system in this country of the haves and the have nots. It will place everyone, minus only the super rich, on the public dole and create the largest welfare state imaginable. And the largest class of americans, the middle class will be decimated by this legislation, and as the middle class goes, so goes the american economy. And as for the heavy handed tactics, just read the bill. Read the fines and penalties that will be incurred for those businesses and private citizens who buck this system once it is enacted. He says we wont be forced to give up our current coverage, but if our current carrier makes even the slightest change in our contract, that change allows the government to step in and force us into their program. That is the way this bill is worded. So how does he say he isn't going to force anyone to buy into it? He can't unless he is lying straight out.","big-brother-should-we-concerned","04:41 PM","government-debates","16"

Bush and Cheney already had all our names and information filed away and all Obama has to do is to go into these files and find out anything he wants to know about us. Geesh! Get a grip! We've been spied on for years by the busy little Bush/Cheneyniks. It's annoying to be sure, but when my daughters and I spoke over the phone we always felt sorry for the poor sot who had to listen to our boring conversations so we always tried to toss in little jokes to make their lives easier.","CUNxTime","364296","I would be equally mad/concerned if it were Bush or Obama. If Bush was doing that illegally he should be investigated. SAME for Obama. I can't imagine you supported Bush taking names and if not it should make you just as mad if Obama's doing it. If it is going on it isn't ""Annoying"" its illegal, unethical, and against the American way.","big-brother-should-we-concerned","05:49 PM","government-debates","17"

But they were thoroughly panicked by Bush/Cheney/Rove and did everything that Bush/Cheney told them too. I also think that after Cheney mailed the anthrax to Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy, congressional reps were thoroughly frightened by the Bush/Cheney mob.","big-brother-should-we-concerned","01:19 PM","government-debates","18"
