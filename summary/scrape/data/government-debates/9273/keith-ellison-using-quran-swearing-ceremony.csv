Its clear to me that demanding the Bible be used is unconstitutional, but I am still curious as to reactions.","keith-ellison-using-quran-swearing-ceremony","02:47 PM","government-debates","1"

Notice that the form of the oath or affirmation is not specified, nor is any holy book required, nor are the words ""...so help me God"" required. On the other hand, the oath or affirmation for the President is specified. ""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."" That is in Section 1 of Article II. Notice that this form of oath or affirmation does not specify ""...so help me God"" either. Nor does it require some holy book. It is just a tradition.","keith-ellison-using-quran-swearing-ceremony","07:35 PM","government-debates","3"

It's making absolute XXXXXX out of all the people who are up in arms about Ellison's decision to swear on a Koran, and it's put Minnesota back on the map as a spearhead in liberalism after eight years in the shadow of that dopehead Ventura and a Republican-held state congress.","keith-ellison-using-quran-swearing-ceremony","10:05 AM","government-debates","4"

If a man has no spiritual connection to the Bible, what is the connection to the oath he gave on it? We know if he lies, God will not strike him down; so I would agree, we should let him use something he finds worth in.","keith-ellison-using-quran-swearing-ceremony","10:09 PM","government-debates","7"

Otherwise everyone should simply swear on the constitution and religion should have nothing to do with it. What do they want, for him to swear in on a bible? How sincere would that be on his part?
