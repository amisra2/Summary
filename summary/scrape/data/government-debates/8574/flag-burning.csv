"07-25-2006","8574",1,"None","None","None","PoohBear","224618","www.flagburning.com Flag Burning is our Patriotic Duty There comes a point when the citizens, Acting as the Fourth Branch of Government, have a duty to their country to rise up and slap the government down when it gets out of line. We must never forget that the government exists for only one purpose, and that is to serve the people. That the government and the courts derive their powers by the consent of the people, and that the government has a duty to put the Will of the People above it's own self interests. When the government fails, it is the duty and the responsibility of the people to put the government in it's place and let the government know that it is, in fact subservient to the people. Our forefathers did not fight and die to preserve the flag, but rather they fought and died to protect our right to burn it, just as our founding fathers did to the British flag. The burning of the flag is an act that asserts the right of the people over the government. The denial of the right to burn the flag is the assertion of the government to rule the people. America is ruled by the people, not the government, and it is in fact our patriotic duty, at this juncture to assert that duty. Flag Burning is a patriotic act done by people who care deeply enough about our freedoms to challenge the government when it becomes a threat to the people. Patriots who love America burn flags. In the 1960s the government got itself trapped in the Vietnam War (police action) and was unable to get itself out. The systems of government failed to make itself do what was right. But the people, in order to preserve the nation, rose up against the government, forcing it to act in a lawful and responsible manner. In this case the electoral college has failed to produce a result that anyone can rely on. This is a failure of the methods of the Constitution itself. Now we have opportunists who would usurp the power of the people, who have clearly spoke their intent through the popular vote, and substitute a process that has failed. That is not acceptable. It might be different if the electoral system produced a clear winner, even if it disagreed with the popular vote. That would have been a different situation. But the electoral system didn't produce a clear winner. It failed! And we must admit that it failed. If Gore, by some chance were to have won under the electoral system, and he could have if he had a spine (as electors are people and free to vote as they choose) then the Bush supporters should have burned the flag. The process, as applied to these circumstances is unfair, and the courts have a duty to declare the process void. If they fail to do their duty, it is our duty to enforce the Will of the People on the courts. When the electoral system fails to produce a result that the people can rely on, we must go with the popular vote. George Bush lost this election. He lost the popular vote, and he lost the Florida vote. But because his brother is governor and the secretary of State is going to get to be an ambassador, the vote was manipulated to produce a false result. I will not accept Bush as president (Al Gore does not speak for me on this issue) and if he is installed in that office then this country will not be my country and I will treat the government as an occupying foreign power and that a coup has occurred. I therefore urge all loyal citizens to make it clear to the Republican controlled press that we will not accept this and that we are prepared to burn the flag to make our voices heard. I call on all of you to begin organizing a massive flag burning to be held at the moment Bush is sworn in. And maybe some burnings sooner. When the government becomes the lawbreaker then there is no law. The United States Supreme Court will now be known as the Republican Supreme Court. I have to agree with this statement; ""Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year's presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law"", Justice Stevens of the United States supreme court, in his dissenting opinion. You got that right sucker! And if you think we're just going to sit here and let it happen, you're wrong. I need someone to produce an animated flag burning gif file for me to post and distribute. -http://www.flagburning.org/- can you guys read this and tell me what you think..

I don't know, call me old fashion, but i always thought that the best thing about a democracy is the ability to vote, thats how you change government and get things done they way they should. If the government has failed in your eyes vote against it, and if the rest of the counrty agrees with you then they will be voted out. The Flag stands for Freedom and is a simble of what Americas founding fathers fought for, and when you spit on the flag you spit on them. Burning the flag is a disgusting act and i hold no respect, at all, for anyone who takes part in it. Plus its the most useless form of protest anyone can do. Why would you take part in a form of protest that only makes you look like an idiot and gets the rest of your proud country men against you. Why not do something actually proactive and not violent. Stop acting like a XXXXX and actually get something done. Presonally i think the best thing to do is vote, its not only your duty as a citizen of the free world but thats the only way a democracy works. You know what, i find it alittle ironic, but its mostly the dems that advocate this kind of action. lol, the same dems that are always saying that ""oh oh you can't do this, you can't say that, you don't want to offend them"", but as soon as the act is against America it becomes a constitutional right. well you know what its not a constitutional right, your not saying anything, your acting out violently. You know what, i dare you, heck i double dog dare you. go to North Korea, Cuba, China, and and try and pull this, they'd send you back in a body bag. Then we'll see what you have to say about America. As you can tell this kinda thing gets me pretty mad. Im not American, im Canadian, but i have the up most respect for America and everything it stands for. I even have a nice big American flag right beside my Canadian one in my room.

If it's their wood and they are not harming anyone, what's the difference? For the people who say the flag is just a piece of fabric, than the word nigger is just a word and the swastika is just a plus sign doing cartwheels. I find it funny to see the same people arguing that burning a flag is ok, but someone displaying a Confederate flag in the back window of their pick-up truck is a slap in the face to all black people. If I can burn a flag, can I yell fire in a crowded theatre? It's my freedom of speech, right? If I can burn the American flag, why not urinate on a POW flag? Wait, that's going too far...isn't it? It's my freedoms!!! But it doesn't mean I should. Personally, I think burning any nation's flag is wrong. It's disrespectful and is a lame way to get attention for yourself. There are many other ways you can get attention to your cause without desecrating a flag. Of course, since this country is free, I believe it should be legal. People have the right to do and say what they want, even sad disrespectful things. If the American flag means nothing to you, that's fine. If all you see when you look at the flag is oil, Iraq and Bush that's your opinion. But try and think of the mother who all she has left of her son is a flag. Think of the veterans who look at that flag and see their fallen comrades when retreat plays everyday. Think of all the times that flag rushed into battle against the British and was the last one standing. Think of how happy Allied soldiers were when they saw P-51 Mustangs flying over them with the Stars and Bars painted on the wings.

That's what you are trying to do, ban flag burning. There's a difference in not liking it and legally banning it. Said it perfectally here. You have the right to, but probably shouldn't. But the government isn't there to tell you you shouldn't. Is it disrespectful? Sure, but that's the entire purpose of the 1st amendment. No matter how disgusting and disrespectful you are being towards the country/government, you are free to do it. Hopefully you look like a XXXXX to other people, but sorry the government has no basis to ban flag burning. Couldn't have said it better myself. You can request that, and people can do it or not. The government has no place telling us what we can or can't do to our property. None. Respect?

But in all seriousness the day we ban flag burning is the day the flag loses it's meaning. That is the day I will burn it because it now represents nothing but fabric, and the memory of what once was a free country. Burning a flag is violence? And I'm not arguing for flag burning, but against banning it. I don't deny it makes you look like an idiot, but you should always have that right. That's the ing point!!!

Still, the first amendment says no laws against peaceful protest. And a rebellion isn't exactly a peaceful protest... so, did the founding fathers only do what was necessary to create their free state and expect that some of the things they did not be done again because their would be other means in a democracy? That said, because of the brave things they did and because they fought for freedom and democracy should we not honour them by not burning the flag and protecting the flag from harm through legislation?

And im all for freedom of speech and will never allow the Government to pass such legislation that will limit the freedoms of speech. However, there is one thing i value more then the freedom of speech, and that is the flag. The Flag must be given special protection because of the emotional and symbolic meaning it represents. I can't stand to see the flag mistreated in anyway. Its an insult to the founding fathers and the millions who died for democracy and freedom. I fly my Canadian flag with the up most pried. I don't agree, at all, with some of the things canada has done; we tax to much, we throw away money, the government has made our military look like a joke (although i still respect our troops and would fight despit the lack of everything the government equips them with) and even the make up of our parliment could easily be abused and used against freedom (hopefully we see some reform from Prim Minister harper). But i will never think about mistreating that glourious flag.","zachvac","225913","Actually, I'm not basing it all on freedom of speech.

Still, the first amendment says no laws against peaceful protest. And a rebellion isn't exactly a peaceful protest... so, did the founding fathers only do what was necessary to create their free state and expect that some of the things they did not be done again because their would be other means in a democracy? That said, because of the brave things they did and because they fought for freedom and democracy should we not honour them by not burning the flag and protecting the flag from harm through legislation?
