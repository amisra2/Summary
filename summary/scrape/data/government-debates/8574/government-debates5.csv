"10-09-2006","8574",5,"zachvac","233778","Yep. Also I seem to remember the main opposition to the Bill of Rights was NOT people who didn't want those rights, it was people who thought that people would assume it meant you needed a right to be given in the Constitution to exercise it. They added the 9th and 10th amendments just because of that. Yet people still seem to not be able to comprehend the purpose of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. I actually heard one person the other day say the purpose of the Constitution was to keep us safe as a nation. I almost died","Steeeeve","234372","The 9th and 10th amendment (very related...you should read the article I posted in the gay forums about this) don't deal with constitutional rights that are just not listed but rather they try to keep the federal government from expanding into powers and denying rights they just dont have. A big thing of the anti-federalists was to keep state power and to limit the federal. The anti-federalits feared the judiciary most of all...turns out to be a good fear. I think everyone should read this professors history of the 9th found in part here: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.c...ract_id=505482","flag-burning","11:57 PM","government-debates","63"
