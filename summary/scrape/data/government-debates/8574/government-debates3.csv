"08-02-2006","8574",3,"Evan","None","Im still disagree with you that it is freespeech. And if you want we can do this debate. And as for you republican comment... aren't the democracts the same way?","zachvac","225982","Yep, lots of people are brainwashed into believing what they believe and aren't capable of evaulating their own beliefs or ever changing them. Sorry I got a bit upset there hopefully you aren't one of those people. In terms of a debate, is this a good topic? ""Flag Burning is Constitutionally protected as free speech"". I would argue the affirmative and already said the SC decision couldn't be used as proof. I'll deal with the rest of this with pm's, I'm not sure exactly how to do this, but I know billsco sort of handles the formal debates, so I'll pm him. Also as of tommorrow morning I won't be here and will be back Sunday morning. College visit. Thanks.","flag-burning","12:57 PM","government-debates","31"

And for the debate thing, that sounds good. im gone all weekend until Tuesday, and Ill post as often as i can, but i should be getting a full time placement (security guard) soon and the hours might be a little crazy. But i'll try my very best to post as soon as possible, just be patient with me sometimes. You just have to set the whole thing up because i don't even know who billsco is or how to contact the pm's.","flag-burning","01:19 PM","government-debates","32"
"08-02-2006","8574",3,"zachvac","None","Well I guess does anyone else want to do this formal debate? Evan's backed down saying he doesn't care about the Constitution as much as the flag. Is there anyone here who cares about the Constitution and thinks that flag burning is not protected by the Constitution?","Steeeeve","226000","Former Justice O'Connor or Justice Stevens might think flag burning is not protected. I think they make a bad argument though relying on the fact that the flag is symbolic and it might hurt someones feelings to burn it. I think political speech is the most protected speech though and thus you can't create a ban on that speech without an amendment. With that said, I don't mind being a judge. In those debates I don't believe in judging on which side is right but who makes the best argument. ALso, what colleges are you visting Zachvac? Any in VA?","flag-burning","01:49 PM","government-debates","33"
"08-02-2006","8574",3,"Evan","None","Your complaining because i missed acouple of commas... so what . i f you don't understand something simply ask and i'll clearify , if you do understand perfectly then suck it up. They where not directed at you, so you can just calm down alittle.","electrolyte","226016","There you go, tell me I'm a whiner because you make yourself out to be a second-grader. Can you seriously expect to have a serious conversation with communication like that? Uh, no? I'm not African-American; if you were slandering blacks, you think I should sit down and shut up because I'm not black? Put together some semblance of rational thought and I'll give it a look. Otherwise I won't bother. ... Ah, I see you're thinking about a debate. Well, this should be quick.","flag-burning","02:51 PM","government-debates","35"

Usually there's a posting time limit that we agree on. I'd be willing to do a week (7 days). Is that enough time for you? Since it's summer, I should be able to post within 2-3 days, usually at night.","flag-burning","03:07 PM","government-debates","36"
"08-02-2006","8574",3,"Steeeeve","None","ALso, what colleges are you visting Zachvac? Any in VA?","zachvac","226020","Actually none in VA are on my list. Both the University of Maryland College Park (which is really close to the DC/MD border, and not far from VA) and University of Maryland Baltimore Campus are there. Tommorrow though I'm going up to Cleveland to look at Case Western Reserve University. From what I've heard and seen so far it looks like one of my top choices, assuming I can talk to the baseball coach, he still hasn't answered my email","flag-burning","03:09 PM","government-debates","37"

""free speech"" they call it.. so what happens if i say "" i all muslims because i think they knocked down our towers"".. will i be chastised and ridiculed for using my rights of free speech. of course!!! because other people will say thats racist... well my excuse is saying ""free speech"".. but there are boundaries. and no one will step up and say weve crossed the line and we need to be pulled back across is..","flag-burning","11:16 PM","government-debates","38"

You missed a word, there, PoohBear... You won't be chastised and ridiculed for availing yourself of your right to free speech; you'll be chastised for being a bigot. There's a big difference. (Is Mel Gibson being ridiculed for speaking? No; he's being ridiculed for having the ridiculous thoughts that inspired those words. Being racist/bigoted is despicable regardless of whether you publicize your racism/bigotry.)","flag-burning","12:11 AM","government-debates","39"
"08-03-2006","8574",3,"electrolyte","None","So you're lambasting me for doing something I have the right to do because I'm not obligated to do it? I have the right to post here on 4forums, but I'm not obligated to. Here I am posting, and you don't lambaste me for it. Obviously, this isn't your entire point. Make up your mind.","Jason","226075","Have you ever burned a flag? Have you ever urinated on a POW flag? I thought you said you never did, so I don't see how I am lambasting you for something you have never done. But do you honestly believe it is ok for any person to urinate on a POW flag just because they think they have a good reason to do it? You said it's their judgment call, right? Do you see it as disrespectful or sad like I do? Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.","flag-burning","12:23 AM","government-debates","40"

The point is however, that most people would equally chastise people for flag burning. But thats not to say they can't do it. I don't really see how people get so confused on this issue. Just because doing something is offensive and stupid (be it flag burning or anti-Muslim remarks) doesn't mean it should be illegal. That is what free speech is. I do wonder about those who spout the ""if people say they have the right to burn my flag I have a right to make racial/religious slurs about Muslims"". Well, yeah. Nobody says you don't, but you have to wonder why you'd want to...","flag-burning","08:27 PM","government-debates","42"
"08-03-2006","8574",3,"None","None","None","Jason","226259","Well, I agree with you that it should be legal. I read a blog today that sums up pretty much everything I feel about this debate,(I'm still new here so I don't know how to link or quote properly) http://www.blogography.com/archives/2005/07/flag.html ""FLAG BURNERS: Lighting up a flag in protest is pathetic, lame, and disrespectful. You are doing NOTHING to further your cause. All you are doing is trying to get attention because you know flag burning is going to upset people (and these people are probably far braver and worthy than your sorry will ever be). Obviously, you are unintelligent, unimaginative, and most-likely illiterate if the only way you can make your point is to burn something. Furthermore, the fact that people can puke and on the flag with no recourse makes your act of defiance just sad and embarrassing FLAG-BURNING BAN POLITICIANS: The flag of the United States of America is an enduring symbol of this Nation. It does not require protection. You can burn it, on it, or wipe up puke with it... and this country shall endure. Your pathetic attempt at lying to people about preserving freedom while making laws that would limit this same freedom is a slap in the face to anyone who has ever died while serving under it. Shame on you. Shame on you for crapping all over the memory of these brave people by using the flag as a distraction from the REAL problems facing this Nation. Shame on you for wasting valuable time on flag-waving while your constituents are going sick because they can't afford to visit the doctor or buy medication. Shame on you for speaking out so vocally over a piece of cloth when people are wearing tattered rags because they have no jobs to earn money to buy clothing. Shame on you for wrapping yourself in the flag at a time when brave men and women are dying in service of it far from home. Stop it. Just stop. Stop bringing shame to yourself and the people you serve and DO YOUR JOB! ""","flag-burning","11:50 PM","government-debates","43"
