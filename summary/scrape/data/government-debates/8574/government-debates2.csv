I don't know, call me old fashion, but i always thought that the best thing about a democracy is the ability to vote, thats how you change government and get things done they way they should. If the government has failed in your eyes vote against it, and if the rest of the counrty agrees with you then they will be voted out. The Flag stands for Freedom and is a simble of what Americas founding fathers fought for, and when you spit on the flag you spit on them. Burning the flag is a disgusting act and i hold no respect, at all, for anyone who takes part in it. Plus its the most useless form of protest anyone can do. Why would you take part in a form of protest that only makes you look like an idiot and gets the rest of your proud country men against you. Why not do something actually proactive and not violent. Stop acting like a XXXXX and actually get something done. Presonally i think the best thing to do is vote, its not only your duty as a citizen of the free world but thats the only way a democracy works. You know what, i find it alittle ironic, but its mostly the dems that advocate this kind of action. lol, the same dems that are always saying that ""oh oh you can't do this, you can't say that, you don't want to offend them"", but as soon as the act is against America it becomes a constitutional right. well you know what its not a constitutional right, your not saying anything, your acting out violently. You know what, i dare you, heck i double dog dare you. go to North Korea, Cuba, China, and and try and pull this, they'd send you back in a body bag. Then we'll see what you have to say about America. As you can tell this kinda thing gets me pretty mad. Im not American, im Canadian, but i have the up most respect for America and everything it stands for. I even have a nice big American flag right beside my Canadian one in my room. And just so electrolyte knows, only the first paragraph was directed towards him lol. unless he's burned a flag, i which case the whole things direct towards him lol.","zachvac","225865","OK, so I want no more dissent. If you don't agree with ANYTHING the government does, show it in the polls. Other than that no complaining about what Big Brother is doing. See how silly that sounds? Of course voting accomplishes it, but speech and expression is also a big part of Democracy. a simble? Interesting. But in all seriousness the day we ban flag burning is the day the flag loses it's meaning. That is the day I will burn it because it now represents nothing but fabric, and the memory of what once was a free country. Burning a flag is violence? And I'm not arguing for flag burning, but against banning it. I don't deny it makes you look like an idiot, but you should always have that right. That's the ing point!!! This is not North Korea, Cuba, or China. This is the ing United States of America, the land of the free. And you don't need a Constitutional right to burn your own property. btw I am not a dem and I have never said anything of that nature. If this forum wasn't censored you would be hearing a lot of words that would offend a lot of people coming out of my mouth (well actually appearing on the keyboard, but you get the point). Again, I will not defend any flag burner. It's a disgusting thing to do. But the day we start stiffling acts we find disgusting because of political views is the day we start to become like North Korea, Cuba, and China.","flag-burning","12:38 AM","government-debates","16"

Something like ""Flag burning is a Constitutional right"". To be fair we wouldn't be able to use Supreme Court decisions as proof (since they've sided with me) although we could still use similar reasoning. I would argue the affirmative. This is for anyone but particularly directed at Evan since he's so sure it's not. So how about it? No SC decisions as proof, just the Constitution and writings from the founders as to what they meant. You up for it?","flag-burning","12:42 AM","government-debates","17"

And im all for freedom of speech and will never allow the Government to pass such legislation that will limit the freedoms of speech. However, there is one thing i value more then the freedom of speech, and that is the flag. The Flag must be given special protection because of the emotional and symbolic meaning it represents. I can't stand to see the flag mistreated in anyway. Its an insult to the founding fathers and the millions who died for democracy and freedom. I fly my Canadian flag with the up most pried. I don't agree, at all, with some of the things canada has done; we tax to much, we throw away money, the government has made our military look like a joke (although i still respect our troops and would fight despit the lack of everything the government equips them with) and even the make up of our parliment could easily be abused and used against freedom (hopefully we see some reform from Prim Minister harper). But i will never think about mistreating that glourious flag.","flag-burning","01:41 AM","government-debates","19"

I realize that the founding fathers protested the British by burning their flag in protest. And the Bill of rights was written to change the way things were and make a completely free state. Still, the first amendment says no laws against peaceful protest. And a rebellion isn't exactly a peaceful protest... so, did the founding fathers only do what was necessary to create their free state and expect that some of the things they did not be done again because their would be other means in a democracy? That said, because of the brave things they did and because they fought for freedom and democracy should we not honour them by not burning the flag and protecting the flag from harm through legislation? Would they even want that? Just so ya know, im not thinking this way because your request, i was starting to think about it during my last post...
