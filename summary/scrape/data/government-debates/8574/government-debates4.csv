"10-03-2006","8574",4,"Yossarian","233315","You admit that it wouldn't be fair w/out using the Supreme Court's decision (whose job, by the way, is interpreting the Constitution), but then suggest ""similar reasoning""? And forgive me, but for anyone to use the ""founders intent"" as their guidelines seems ludicrous, since if we'd been running things for almost 300 years based on that women couldn't vote (or indeed anyone who wasn't a white male landowner over 16), indians wouldn't count at all, and blacks would only be 3/5ths. The revered ""founders"" were, so sorry, quite fallible and rather stupid about some things, which is why we have amendments to try and rectify that stupidity.","zachvac","233639","I was basically saying it wouldn't be fair if I could say ""The Supreme Court ruled with my side, so I win. Read the Constitution. Although the definitions then were that females couldn't vote, etc. the Constitution is meant to last. It has very little specifics in it and is really an amazing document the more you study it. Part of that Constitution was also the amendment process. That's part of the Constitution and perfectly valid as part of what the intent of people was.","flag-burning","11:23 PM","government-debates","47"
"10-04-2006","8574",4,"Yossarian","233652","Yeah, fine; their intent was that there would be and amendment process . But you aren't seriously claiming that they intended for blacks to vote, but just didn't get around to it, are you? That they intended for liquor to be one day banned, then legalized again? You basically justified what I said. ""The revered ""founders"" were, so sorry, quite fallible and rather stupid about some things, which is why we have amendments to try and rectify that stupidity."" That many of them regretted not including the Bill of Rights I don't dispute. (see, I do read ) But there's no justification for the idea of giving them credit for everything that's changed in the Constitution since 1787. I was pointing out that it seemed silly to me to use their percieved intent to argue about flag burning. Counting Indians not at all and Negroes at 3/5 strikes me as pretty specific, but maybe more than a quarter of the population is ""little"" to some. I guess it sucks for the Natives, then, that 90% or more of them had already been wiped out by plague a century before. I guess it's a moot point now, as you're debate appears to have barely made it off the ground anyway. It looks like you won by default, from what I read last night.","Steeeeve","233700","Whats the argument here? The anti-federalists were the ones that wanted a Bill of Rights and the federalists thought it was a bad idea since it might be exploited to expand federal power. To prevent this, the 9th and 10th amendments were created but have been pretty much ignored. As for flag burning, I bet you could make an argument that the first amendment doesn't prohibit a state from burning the flag. You would have to argue that the 14th amendment didn't apply the amendments to the states and thus free speech is not a state issue and you could ban it.","flag-burning","01:34 PM","government-debates","49"

Basically I was just saying the Constitution wasn't meant for specifics. It lays the foundation for a country. It doesn't mention white, rich, landowners. It mentions voters. It doesn't mention TV, radio, voice, it mentions speech. It's very general and meant to work with many changes to life. But they realized that there were some things they couldn't have forseen, so there is an amendment process. I'm not even crediting the writers, but the thing they produced was pretty good, you must admit. I'm not giving them credit for allowing blacks to vote, I'm saying they didn't try to stop blacks from voting. There's a difference there.","flag-burning","05:36 PM","government-debates","51"
"10-04-2006","8574",4,"Yossarian","233716","There's no argument. It's just that someone seemed to take exception to my claiming that it's silly for people to constantly be using the ""founder's intent"" as justification for present-day arguments. Like I said, it's fine to say that their ""intent"" was that there be an amendment process. No one's disputing that. But just because they intended, and implemented, that process doesn't justify extrapolating their views on a hundred different subjects like abortion, flag-burning, etc., which seems to be what zachvac was implying:","Steeeeve","233774","I agree that 'intent"" is a bad thing because 1) whos ""intent"" do you want and 2) what do you mean by intent? Intent can be a play a part but you really have to go by orginial meaning which is different from intent in that you look at what the clause meant when first adopted. There really is no other logical way to view a clause other than what you want it to mean today...which I suppose isn't logical.","flag-burning","10:47 PM","government-debates","52"

The orginial constitution (minus the amendments) sets up a system of government. It grants a specific amount of powers (and some limits) for the FEDERAL government. The bill of rights was to please the anti-federalists who felt the federal government would assume too much power. It is interesting in that the constitution tends to grant powers to the federal government implying all other powers are elsewhere while the bill of rights was created to restrict (to help ensure) powers of the federal government..in other words, it was the opposite. The reasons behind this are important in understanding what the goal was with the constitution which helps understand the orginial meaning...use intent does play a role but it isn't everything.","flag-burning","10:52 PM","government-debates","53"

Also I seem to remember the main opposition to the Bill of Rights was NOT people who didn't want those rights, it was people who thought that people would assume it meant you needed a right to be given in the Constitution to exercise it. They added the 9th and 10th amendments just because of that. Yet people still seem to not be able to comprehend the purpose of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. I actually heard one person the other day say the purpose of the Constitution was to keep us safe as a nation. I almost died","flag-burning","10:54 PM","government-debates","54"

"10-07-2006","8574",4,"Yossarian","233992","LMAO. Tho I've read that not nearly as many of the passengers on those early ships were Quakers as we've been told. I'll try to re-find the source for that tho.","Baltidog","234085","Well I was referring to the signers of the Declaration of Independence. http://www.adherents.com/gov/Foundin..._Religion.html 4.3% where Quakers. Also 1.9% of the signers were Huguenots. Those Hugenots were some serious iconoclasts and would never have made a pledged to a flag. Oh and the Hugenots were the first settlers in the USA.","flag-burning","12:04 PM","government-debates","58"
