Wake up MR, 2005 minus 1776 = 229 years not 119. Unless in a wierd way you think 1884 is the birth of the nation.","what-happened-america","05:32 AM","government-debates","17"

The 2 party system as we know it did not even emerge until the 1920s. Prior to that, there was nothingt o keep a third party out, and several times third parties either took elections or changed significantly the result of those elections. In the 1920s democrats and repunblicans started running legislation that would stifle third parties. Everything from how parties could be organized, funded and what election tactics could be used was changed in order to destroy third party chances of victory. It was not until the 60s that the dems and republicans really cemented their hold onthe country and essentially gauranteed that they could never be removed as political powers. I guess ""real americans"" don't bother to learn their nations history, either.","what-happened-america","12:10 PM","government-debates","21"

"07-06-2005","5853",2,"Big_Bear_Scot","None","Tell that to Bill Clinton, votes for a third party candidate effectively handed him the Presidency over GW Bush 1. Or if you want a more recent example if all those who voted for Nadar voted for Gore then the result of 2000 Election could have been different. A vote for a 3rd Party is not a wasted vote, it is a way for citizens to express their dissatisfaction with the Two Party System. Imagine the turnout if there was no third parties. EDIT I have just done a wee bit of research on Third Parties in the US, and it seems like the current Republican Party started off as a Third Party. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_p...ited_States%29 Scroll down to 1856 and 1860. So in effect todays third party could eventually become one of the big two. I doubt it though.","Voice Of Reason","145240","Of course they can affect the results as Nader and Perot did but they can not win...........That is the point..........","what-happened-america","07:30 PM","government-debates","27"

I don't know how old you are and I don't really take age into account when replying to people. I clearly refuted the argument that a 3rd party vote is a wasted vote and your response is that I'll understand when I'm older and wiser. Please enlighten me, there's no better time to learn then the present. The answer is that the only reason that a third party candidate will never win is because of people like you. I will repeat my refutation. On it's own, your vote means nothing. I will vote in Maryland and we know every single election year that it will go to a Democrat, that's a given. So my vote either way won't matter. Likewise, there is no state that has gone one way or the other by one vote. So individually your vote means nothing. The way you make a difference is voting with the real person you actually want to win. If everyone did that, they might have a shot at winning, but because of you, who are so worried about a wasted vote, the candidates from 3rd parties will never win. Please answer this without another smart remark about how when I'm older I will understand. I'm going to vote in the next presidential election, please enlighten me on where my logic is wrong.","what-happened-america","12:59 AM","government-debates","30"
