Deep inside, they want to know they voted for the person who won. If they vote for a third party, they are convinced they will not vote for the winner. It is this belief that they will not win that makes it so they will not win. We were supposed to decide who we would vote for in the election if we had voted. I picked Badnarick (sp?) for president, and a green party candidate along with a Republican. Probably the only person in our school who didn't pick a Democrat (I go to school in the middle of the big city in a generally poor area, almost everyone votes Democratic). When I vote I will look at where each candidate and where they stand, and pick the one I would like to represent me, regardless of what party they are for.","what-happened-america","01:02 AM","government-debates","31"
