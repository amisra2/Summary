Yeah, that is true enough in terms of military personnel, not in terms of innocent civilians. On the other hand, extremists are being captured and killed at a far greater rate than was happening prior to 9/11. They are literally flocking into Iraq. I often hear anti-war folks say that the ""Flypaper"" stratagy would be a war crime, so I am attempting to reference to it less and less.","bu-h-has-no-use-public-concerns","06:41 PM","government-debates","17"

We're doing an excellent job of spending US lifes and national wealth on our own in Iraq, Afghanistan and with 'homeland defense'. How could they ever match our own efforts?","bu-h-has-no-use-public-concerns","06:45 PM","government-debates","18"

By the time we get to 639 billion and 3000 killed in our offensive in Afganistan and Iraq, they'll lose far more than 1/2 million dollars and 19 people.","bu-h-has-no-use-public-concerns","07:52 PM","government-debates","19"

Fortunately, things have worked out alright. England has been a strong US ally for most of our history (since WWII), irrespective of White House politics.","bu-h-has-no-use-public-concerns","10:09 PM","government-debates","20"

Every time there is a major sucessful strike in Iraq, oil jumps, same with saudi arabia. Thiose guys who are plannign the attacks know when to buy. They are making a FORTUNE on the Iraq war. Despite the Bush administrations rhetoric, less than 10 percent of those killed/captured have been identified as ""foreign fighters"". So all we really know for sure is that AQ is providing moral support for what is going on in Iraq. Zarqawi was not a mamber, nor was he really affiliated with AQ prior tot he war. aFter the US made him famous, BL said ""this is our guy there"". I would be surprised of Al Quedas entire expediture for the Iraq war topped $50 million. On the other hand, if they have not made billions on oil futures, using the attacks in the region to perpetrate spikes in the prices, they are utter fools (and they have already proven they are NOT utter fools). So, yes, they may have lost $50 million so far in IRaq, but their return has to be in the billions. Additionally, they have sucessfully used our agression in Iraq as a recruitment tool and fund raising tool. We ahve yet to see any indication that their phenomenal post invasion growth, both in terms of manpower and money, has slowed at all. IU know I would scrape up $50 million in order to have an inside track on when attacks would be occuring on oil facilities in the ME. Working the futres angle, I would make billions the first year alone, and with todays online trading and money shuffling, nobody would ever be able to track it.","bu-h-has-no-use-public-concerns","11:09 PM","government-debates","21"

You said ""worldwide offensive"", not just America. Is the life of a civilian better/worse than that of a soldier? The terrorists don't care if they're killing civilians or military police. Why would they? An American life is an American life, and they're killing more than ever. Maybe, but so long they're killing so many Americans, it's really not that great. Both terrorists killed and Americans killed have gone up. That seems a hollow victory to me. -Wez","bu-h-has-no-use-public-concerns","06:00 AM","government-debates","22"
