"12-15-2005","7023",6,"doG","None","A US coin with no reference to God is not an atheist coin [nor is it] one that denies God, it is a secular coin. A coin that references God or specifically claims there is no God is a coin that is not secular, being either deist or atheist. Producing currency without acknowledging God is not excluding God from the country, it is simply a restraint of the country, as a nation, declaring God's existence. doG: The same with the Pledge. Before the addition of the words ""under God"", the Pledge was not an exclusion of God or a declaration that God did not exist. It was simply secular. Adding those words make the Pledge a declaration as a nation that there is a deity. That is an endorsement for belief, without them, it is not.","DamEtel","185484","Right. And correctly implied (but not actually stated) is the follow up that the government's mandating ""In God We Trust"" be put on our currency IS a statement by the government that God exists, and also has our government giving God a thumbs up endorsement. Agreed. The Pledge of Allegiance should be returned to its secular state, with the late religious addition removed.","holiday-trees","01:15 PM","government-debates","77"

Hell, I call the tree my family has had the solstice bush. Any problems there? I hope not.","maco","187760","Nope, they were Yule trees.

"12-20-2006","7023",6,"None","None","None","dislexia","244485","Cristmas trees have a colerfull background. Many people belive that it has pagan origins but was turrned into a cristian tradition when people started putting religious orniments on it. Cristians normaly use evergreen trees to symbolise eternal live (scince the trees are ""eternaly green""). The fact is, they are a christian tradition, and in my opinion they should be refered to as cristmas trees. Manoras (sorry if i misspelled it) are a Jewish tradition and should continue to be reffered to as manoras not ""8 holliday candalsticks"" However the government should not make laws about what people can call things like cristmas trees and manoras, if they did, many people would get mad. in all honesty, I take the tearm holiday tree offensive because I think it is an attempt to remove religion from our society.","holiday-trees","09:03 PM","government-debates","85"
