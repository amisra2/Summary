Non Christians celebrate Christmas. Its recognized as a federal holiday so it should not be taken away. The liberals think they are getting back at the right-wing Christians, but they are not. ITs pathetic, its a Christmas tree, dradles are not holiday tops they are dradles, manorahs are not holiday candle holders, they are manorahs. And if the companies are doing it for money to please all people, they are loosing oney becuase the number of people that celebrate Chistmas in this country is 96%. So this Christmas bashing is bad for everyone, Liberals look dumb when they try to support these Christmas hating companies, Christmas celebrators dont get the joy of their holiday.","holiday-trees","01:16 AM","government-debates","3"

During the communist era, many religous holidays where removed from the calender in order to further the bolsjevik propaganda. Instead, ideological holidays where introduced (like the birthday of Lenin and what-not). When the wall came tumbling down, the russians where not prepared to let go of their communist-hollidays, while they fought fiercily to get the religous hollidays back into the calender (with the payed days-off naturally, you cannot worship your god unless you get a salary for it). So now, they have two sets of holidays, and twice as many as before. And sure, it is selfish.

Christmas itself didn't come around until about 400 A.D. Even then it was in major controversy because many Christians believed that celebrating one's birthday was something that the pagans did. It was finally placed in December simply because that was when the winter solstice was. Okay, now I know that's not what the main point of this is but I thought I'd give a little history. Now I don't know about Christmas in other countries, but in America it has become commercialized. (For example, the concept we have of Santa Claus was based upon a Coke ad. Santa Claus, or actually St. Nick, was a Turkish man back I believe in the 900's A.D. who did some good deeds by tossing coins in the window of some man so he wouldn't have to sell his 3 daughters into slavery and quite possibly prostitution to help pay a debt. I could almost assume that if Christmas were held in August or September, Santa would be wearing a Speedo instead of a red suit.) Now I don't believe that this is a liberal VS concervative thing. This is typical American business not making a good choice and then is confused when people question what they are doing. This happens a lot. *I'm not sure of the proper spelling but I'm sure you know I'm referring to the calender.","holiday-trees","01:28 PM","government-debates","21"

What if I were to say that they way we in-vision Santa Claus here in America is based off of an early coke ad. And if not a coke ad, then at least through the poem ""The Night Before Christmas."" Now I don't know what Americans before the late 1800's viewed Santa Claus as looking like, but the view we in America have of him now as that fat man with the red suit and hat on with a white beard came from a mixture of an early coke ad and the poem I mentioned. There is no doubt in my mind that he looked entirely different in real life. If he were born in Turkey, he would have probably had a darker grayer beard for one thing.

"12-12-2005","7023",3,"Eddie","None","I guess I could dig up a link, but I can assure you that I celebrate christmas on the 24:th (christmas eve). Celebrating christmas on the 25:th (christmas day) is an anglo-saxon tradition as far as I know. Yule was here long before christmas. It was a tradition among various germanic tribe. The actual word ""Yule"" derives from norweigan word ""Jul"", which still is the same holliday as christmas. I`m not arguing that christmas isn`t a holiday founded on religion, but that it is also founded on pagan rituals and traditions. Many aspects of the anglo-saxon christmas comes from the germanic pre-christian traditions of ""Yule"". Like the christmas tree...

Can you honestly say that without Christianity we would have a holiday called Christmas? No doubt Christmas takes many traditions from Yule and other various holidays. Yule is still not the same holiday as Christmas though. Christmas has one sole purpose for its creation...to celerbrate the birth of Christ...thus MASS of CHRIST. This is so very clear by just looking at Yule being celebrated as a Winter Solitice in Australia which is in June/July. No Christ = no Christmas. Very simple concept. It was set up as a religious holiday. Very simple concept. As for the Christmas Tree, It has long been called a Christmas tree and there is no indication that the cone-shaped tree was for any other holiday eventhough Yule did use a tree. We can set up a Dogwood tree and call it a holiday tree, how about that..leave the Christmas tree's name alone unless you have a valid reason to change it.","holiday-trees","02:15 PM","government-debates","40"

Sure, ""Yule"" can also refer to some neo-pagan ritual as well as an archaic tradtition among germanic tribes, but it also refers to ""christmas"". Yule=Jul=Christmas Christmas had probably many purposes for it`s creation. Celebrating the mass of christ was probably one of them. By neo-pagans, yes. As is, No [insert various pagan influences]=no christmas, at least not as you know it today I have no intention of changing your name ""christmas tree"" but I don`t see why you would object to other people using other names for it. Our name is still ""Yule/Christmas pine"" (Julgran) though .","holiday-trees","02:44 PM","government-debates","41"
"12-12-2005","7023",3,"Steeeeve","None","Without Christ and the Christian faith how you can have a Christmas. Back when Yule was around they weren't going ""hey, this is Christmas"". Why? Because Christmas wasn't even invented then. No pagan influences = less traditions on christmas taken from that culture. The holiday is all about Christ, thats the whole reason it is here. Yule was a winter solitice celebration and only started meaning christmas when Christmas was formed. Once again, Austrialia celebrates this during June and July, obviously not the same as Christmas. It was the only reason actually. HEre is agood link on the orgins of Christmas http://www.mrrena.com/Christmas.shtml","Eddie","184839","But this is the problem. Once it was about Yule and scaring spirits and darkness away*. As christian influence started to penetrate germanic superstition and old traditions, Yule gradually became more and more about the birth of christ. People tended mass and heard the christmas evangelium (if there is such an evangelium) until the old pre-christian traditions lost their meanings. They became mere rituals without any real meaning, like the christmas tree, candles, fire logs and gnomes. And today, the christian and religious meaning of christmas is gradually being replaced by secular meanings such as comfort, friends and family and presents, at least for many of us. Claiming that christmas is about christs birth is not incorrect. The traditions are clearly there (with the baby jesus and the crib and the sermon). But not everyone celebrate christmas this way. For me and my family and friends, chrsitmas is just as much about scaring the darkness and evil spirits away as it is about the birth of christ. The rituals are there, but none of them mean anything other than what we make of them. * This is from a germanic perspective, as in anglo-saxon, swedish, german etc, etc. The history of christmas where naturally different in Roman and greek cultures. Once again, christmas is the english word for a holiday that is called very differently in various languages. The traditions surrounding christmas also vary from country to country. In the nordic countries, christmas is called Jul (Yule) and our traditions are pretty similiar to that of the anglo-saxons., In Germany it is called ""Weinnachten"" (wine night) and their traditions are pretty similiar to ours as well. In Eastern europe, christmas traditions are very different from yours and ours. In France it is called something about Noel (don`t remeber) and their traditions are different, etc, etc. Yule is not a mainstream tradition in australia. It is celebrated by neo-pagans only. These are fringe groups who choose to celbrate an archaic tradition that is currently recognized as christmas. The fact that this small group of people (how many can they be, 100?) does this not negate the fact that Yule means christmas. Are you saying that a think-piece written by the author of ""The Christian Living and Apologetics Website"" is a good source for the historic origin of christmas? He doesn`t even bring up the year the bishop in Rome declared 24th of december to be the birthdate of christ or how it relates to the celebration of the Roman god Saturn... Or all of it`s connections to various other pagan festivities around the world... I`m sorry, but I don`t consider that link as an authoritive on anything other than Eric Knickerbockers own viewpoint and memories of christmas.","holiday-trees","07:01 PM","government-debates","44"
"12-12-2005","7023",3,"Steeeeve","None","You all seem to be missing the point. No Christian value = no Christmas holiday. If we were a Muslim nation we wouldn't have Christmas. If we had no religion we wouldn't have Christmas (as a national holiday that is). In fact, if you didn't ahve christiantity, guess what, no Christmas. It doesn't get much more religious then that. If you want to claim that Christmas doesn't have much of a religious meaning anymore you can but at the same time you can't complain about ""In God We Trust"" or ""One Nation Under God"" because those are just as embedded in our society as Christmas is. Oh, and yes I know Jesus wasn't born on Dec 25th which is why I said ""remember"" instead of ""born on"". Yes, I also know people work on Christmas, Waffle House is open .","zachvac","184869","But you seem to be missing the point I made. I have no problem with Christianity in general, the problem is when it is put in the government. This includes ""One Nation under God"" as well as ""In God we Trust"". If a business wants to make people work on Christmas, it's their choice. If they want to fire people for taking Christmas off, that's their choice. Most employers give their employees off because they know that they wouldn't come to work anyway and they would lose money staying open on Christmas, but many retail stores don't think that way and make lots of money on Christmas.","holiday-trees","09:19 PM","government-debates","45"

Our founders were much more tolerant than that. There's no evidence that those who founded this nation would have felt the freedom of religion should be withheld.

The attacks on the mention of God coming from atheists and the ACLU seem to ignore the FACT that our founding fathers did not intend to exclude God from this country. They said so on several occasions. Some of them wanted even more religious touches in government.","doG","185154","""God is dead"" implies that there was a God in the first place. I am not ignoring the fact that many of the founding fathers were religious or claiming that they intended any exclusion of God from the country. You are ignoring the fact that the 1st Amendment states, "" Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.... "" No laws, none, nada, zip, zilch, etc.. The acts that placed the term ""God"" on US currency and in the Pledge were laws passed by Congress. That has nothing to do with the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, only the plain text prohibition of government's endorsement of religion that they themselves placed in the Constitution. A US coin with no reference to God is not an atheist coin or one that denies God, it is a secular coin. A coin that references God or specifically claims there is no God is a coin that is not secular, being either deist or atheist. Producing currency without acknowledging God is not excluding God from the country, it is simply a restraint of the country, as a nation, declaring God's existence. The same with the Pledge. Before the addition of the words ""under God"", the Pledge was not an exclusion of God or a declaration that God did not exist. It was simply secular. Adding those words make the Pledge a declaration as a nation that there is a deity. That is an endorsement for belief, without them, it is not.","holiday-trees","08:33 AM","government-debates","73"

Many people belive that it has pagan origins but was turrned into a cristian tradition when people started putting religious orniments on it.

The fact is, they are a christian tradition, and in my opinion they should be refered to as cristmas trees. Manoras (sorry if i misspelled it) are a Jewish tradition and should continue to be reffered to as manoras not ""8 holliday candalsticks"" However the government should not make laws about what people can call things like cristmas trees and manoras, if they did, many people would get mad. in all honesty, I take the tearm holiday tree offensive because I think it is an attempt to remove religion from our society.","holiday-trees","09:03 PM","government-debates","85"
