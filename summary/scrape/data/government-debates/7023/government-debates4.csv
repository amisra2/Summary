"12-12-2005","7023",4,"Steeeeve","None","HAHA of course they will say that now. It seems odd that Grant decided that a religious holiday would be a good day to just take off...no religious reasoning for it at all im sure :/","doG","184891","Huh? It's not just now that they're saying it, that was the wording of the original legislation. Didn't you read it? The name of HR2224 of the 41st Congress is, ""An Act Making the first day of January, the twenty-fifth day of December, the fourth day of July, and Thanksgiving day, holidays, within the District of Columbia."" This is the name of the act on the day it was passed by the House of Representatives on June 17, 1870 , as passed by the Senate on June 24, 1870 and as signed by Grant. It wasn't Grant that picked the days, it was Representative Burton C. Cook that drafted the original bill as a result of a campaign by local banker and business men of the District to correspond with similar laws of the States around the district.

"12-13-2005","7023",4,"Steeeeve","None","And it only applied to the District of Columbia...","doG","184922","Correct. All of the ""Federal Holidays"" only apply to the District. The holidays of the States are set by the States. As you can see from the Uniform Holidays Act of 1870, Congress acted to declare holidays for business coinciding with those of the States surrounding it. Similarly, States have passed their own laws enacting holidays for themselves, likely to match those of the States around them. You should also note that the States were not considered to be inhibited by the 1st Amendment to the US Constitution until after the 14th Amendment was passed.","holiday-trees","07:48 AM","government-debates","49"

The declaration of holidays for the District is simply an instrument for declaraing them Federal holidays as opposed to any State holidays. Thanksgiving was initially proclaimed a holiday by Washington for purposes he clearly claimed were religious but there was no 1st Amendment at that point in time. Thanksgiving was later created by the same act that made the 25th of December a holiday but it did so to only make the day a holiday coincidental to the States surrounding the District as solicited of the Congress by the local businessmen and bankers. The wording, terminology and intent of that act was not to create a preference for any religious belief, just a federal holiday that coincided with the holidays of the States. It is important to notice in this context that the States were not inhibited by the Bill of Rights in making there own laws affecting the citizens until the 14th Amendment was passed so the States were free to dclare holidays for any reasons they chose including religious ones. That the Federal Congress wanted to inact legislation on behalf of business for business in coordinating Federal holidays with States holidays does not make the intent to respect a religious establishment, only to coordinate Federal government with State government.","holiday-trees","08:44 AM","government-debates","51"
"12-13-2005","7023",4,"Steeeeve","None","We declared Christmas a national holiday...of course some here believe it was mere coincidence that Dec 25 happened to be Christmas as well. Not only that, but Thanksgiving is going to have to be gotten rid of as well. Lincoln clearly said this is a day for God...","jyoshu","184960","The fact is, if we did what some would like and eradicated every mention of religion and God from govt., we'd lose a great deal of our nation's history. The biggest problem I have with this witch hunt against any religious reference in any govt. sphere is that it's historically revisionist. The idea that the 1st amendment means the very utterance of ""god"" or ""Christ"" the moment one steps across the property line onto govt. land, a classroom, capitol hill, or a prayer in a govt. meeting is pretty new in the history of our country. Our founders were much more tolerant than that. There's no evidence that those who founded this nation would have felt the freedom of religion should be withheld. In fact the very opposite is true: it is apparent that the founding fathers had great respect and tolerance for people of faith and some certainly WERE deeply religious. Would that those who preach liberal ""tolerance"" today follow their example.","holiday-trees","10:50 AM","government-debates","52"

They had a whole debate about how the holidays only applied to DC. A president proclaimation is pretty much what does it. Actually, A president can proclaim a holiday. Like what Lincoln did. Lincoln said it was on the last thursday (later changed obviously...by another president no less). It was not created by the legislation you hold so dear. In fact you can read up on President proclaimations here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal...l_Proclamation Either way you look at it, Thanksgiving was done on religious grounds just like Christmas....guess we gotta get rid of them just like ""In God We Trust"".","holiday-trees","07:25 PM","government-debates","53"

"12-13-2005","7023",4,"Master_Shake","None","To be honest, I agree with Steeeve here, but probably not for the same reasons. Thanksgiving is a celebration of Puritanism over Native Americans. You simply can't seperate Thanksgiving from the Puritans or from what it represents with regard to Native Americans.","doG","185078","Just because Thanksgiving has religious underpinnings does not mean the Congress could only make the last Thursday of November a holiday for the sake of Thanksgiving. If Congress passed a law making the 5th day of September a holiday do you think that would mean they were specifically doing so just to honor your birthday? Of course you can strike Thanksgiving at the Federal Level if you want, the States are still free to retain the holidays set by their own laws prior to the time that they became inhibited by the 14th Amendment. The effect would simply be another act of congress to coordinate holidays with the States which is not prohibited by the Constitution.","holiday-trees","08:40 PM","government-debates","56"

Your congressional record is for DC only...if you don't realize that then we can't go on, it says it right there in the link you provided. ""The intention is that it shall apply only to the Distric of Columbia"" Said over and over. Not only that, proclaiming a holiday can be done by president (see link in my last post). Morever, look at Lincolns Address and tell me that wasn't religious. Christmas is very obvious...They made a holiday on Christmas day, your argument would be like saying the 4th of July is not really to celebrate our independence. You are just fooling yourself into thinking overwise and I wonder why you couldn't fool yourself with ""In God We Trust""....maybe that had no religous meaning too :-/. yeah right.","holiday-trees","09:18 PM","government-debates","58"
