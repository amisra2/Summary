The only people who truly celebrate Christmas, ""Christ Mass"", are people celebrating the birth of Christ . That's what Steeeve is saying, and I agree with him. Others may indeed celebrate Yule, Winter Solstice, Hannakah, whatever. But those aren't Christmas, anymore than celebrating Christmas means celebrating winter solstice. I've never celebrated winter solstice--it's always been Christmas. Remember, the trees that this thread is about are not called ""Solstice Trees."" They are almost always called Christmas trees.","holiday-trees","09:19 AM","government-debates","31"
"12-12-2005","7023",3,"doG","None","Who cares if Iran celebrates anything on that day or China either, even though they do celebrate the Death of Tsongkapa in Tibet on that day. The winter solstice celebration, ""Yule"", dates back more than 4000 years, long before the birth of any alleged jesus. FWIW, President Grant declared Christmas a holiday as a gesture of good will toward men at the same time that he declared New Year's a holiday. It is celebrated throughout the world but it is only religious to christians.","Steeeeve","184716","Ok, but Christmas is the holiday that was declared...not Yule. And who cares that it isn't celebrated in Iran or China? Well you for one. Do you forget this comment... I am still unsure why people are bringing up Yule..we don't celebrate that here. They do it Australia so maybe you should move there (although its in a different month).","holiday-trees","09:30 AM","government-debates","32"
"12-12-2005","7023",3,"zachvac","None","I don't particularly care what they're called. But what does Christmas have to do with trees anyway? How are Christmas trees part of the religious holliday anyway?","Kronus","184724","When Christianity was being spread through Northern Europe, it was a tough sell, and the conversion by sword method wasn't as effective as some would have hoped. So, instead of outlawing the native's old religions, they were co-opted. The natives were allowed to celebrate around the solstice like they always did, but instead of celebrating the birth of the new year, they were told they were celebrating the birth of Jesus. Symbols of the old religion, like trees, wreaths and mistletoe, were incorporated into the new holiday.","holiday-trees","10:05 AM","government-debates","33"
"12-12-2005","7023",3,"Steeeeve","None","You know Yule is celebrated in Austrialia during June and July and not on December 25. As I recall, I have never seen Christmas celebrated on any day but Dec. 25. This may come as a shock, but this holiday was created by Christians (or actually a Pope). Did Grant say ""I declare Christmas a holiday for which we will celebrate one religion""...probably not. Did the congress say ""I declare Chrisitianity the only religion in the US so lets put 'In God We Trust' on our currency"" probably not. Christmas is and has always been a holiday created for and by Christians...thus CHRIST MASS. It is right there in the name. Yule and Christmas are not the same and to think Christmas was not created by and for religious purposes is insane. You of all people should know since you plagiarise Wikipedia so well.","Eddie","184754","Many european countries/cultures celebrate christmas on the 24:th... In fact, they are. Yule can mean different things depending on the situation, but one of it`s meanings is ""christmas"". Just like santa claus and st: nicholas share the same meaning depending on the situation...","holiday-trees","12:35 PM","government-debates","36"

I guess it doesn't matter when you celebrate it as it is still the same thing you are celebrating but do you have a link to this claim. They are not the same thing. We even stated that Yule was here long before Christmas ever was. When the Pope created Christmas he wasn't trying to just replace the word ""Yule"" because it sounded bad. This is easily seen as Yule is celebrated in June and July in Australia and Christmas is celebrated on Dec 25th. Yule might be used in the same meaning as Christmas every now and then but they are clearly two different things in normal use. How is anyone arguing that Christmas is not a holiday founded on religion...this is crazy.","holiday-trees","12:54 PM","government-debates","37"

Celebrating christmas on the 25:th (christmas day) is an anglo-saxon tradition as far as I know. Yule was here long before christmas. It was a tradition among various germanic tribe. The actual word ""Yule"" derives from norweigan word ""Jul"", which still is the same holliday as christmas. I`m not arguing that christmas isn`t a holiday founded on religion, but that it is also founded on pagan rituals and traditions. Many aspects of the anglo-saxon christmas comes from the germanic pre-christian traditions of ""Yule"". Like the christmas tree...

Can you honestly say that without Christianity we would have a holiday called Christmas? No doubt Christmas takes many traditions from Yule and other various holidays. Yule is still not the same holiday as Christmas though. Christmas has one sole purpose for its creation...to celerbrate the birth of Christ...thus MASS of CHRIST. This is so very clear by just looking at Yule being celebrated as a Winter Solitice in Australia which is in June/July. No Christ = no Christmas. Very simple concept. It was set up as a religious holiday. Very simple concept. As for the Christmas Tree, It has long been called a Christmas tree and there is no indication that the cone-shaped tree was for any other holiday eventhough Yule did use a tree. We can set up a Dogwood tree and call it a holiday tree, how about that..leave the Christmas tree's name alone unless you have a valid reason to change it.","holiday-trees","02:15 PM","government-debates","40"

Sure, ""Yule"" can also refer to some neo-pagan ritual as well as an archaic tradtition among germanic tribes, but it also refers to ""christmas"". Yule=Jul=Christmas Christmas had probably many purposes for it`s creation. Celebrating the mass of christ was probably one of them. By neo-pagans, yes. As is, No [insert various pagan influences]=no christmas, at least not as you know it today I have no intention of changing your name ""christmas tree"" but I don`t see why you would object to other people using other names for it. Our name is still ""Yule/Christmas pine"" (Julgran) though .","holiday-trees","02:44 PM","government-debates","41"
"12-12-2005","7023",3,"Steeeeve","None","Without Christ and the Christian faith how you can have a Christmas. Back when Yule was around they weren't going ""hey, this is Christmas"". Why? Because Christmas wasn't even invented then. No pagan influences = less traditions on christmas taken from that culture. The holiday is all about Christ, thats the whole reason it is here. Yule was a winter solitice celebration and only started meaning christmas when Christmas was formed. Once again, Austrialia celebrates this during June and July, obviously not the same as Christmas. It was the only reason actually. HEre is agood link on the orgins of Christmas http://www.mrrena.com/Christmas.shtml","Eddie","184839","But this is the problem. Once it was about Yule and scaring spirits and darkness away*. As christian influence started to penetrate germanic superstition and old traditions, Yule gradually became more and more about the birth of christ. People tended mass and heard the christmas evangelium (if there is such an evangelium) until the old pre-christian traditions lost their meanings. They became mere rituals without any real meaning, like the christmas tree, candles, fire logs and gnomes. And today, the christian and religious meaning of christmas is gradually being replaced by secular meanings such as comfort, friends and family and presents, at least for many of us. Claiming that christmas is about christs birth is not incorrect. The traditions are clearly there (with the baby jesus and the crib and the sermon). But not everyone celebrate christmas this way. For me and my family and friends, chrsitmas is just as much about scaring the darkness and evil spirits away as it is about the birth of christ. The rituals are there, but none of them mean anything other than what we make of them. * This is from a germanic perspective, as in anglo-saxon, swedish, german etc, etc. The history of christmas where naturally different in Roman and greek cultures. Once again, christmas is the english word for a holiday that is called very differently in various languages. The traditions surrounding christmas also vary from country to country. In the nordic countries, christmas is called Jul (Yule) and our traditions are pretty similiar to that of the anglo-saxons., In Germany it is called ""Weinnachten"" (wine night) and their traditions are pretty similiar to ours as well. In Eastern europe, christmas traditions are very different from yours and ours. In France it is called something about Noel (don`t remeber) and their traditions are different, etc, etc. Yule is not a mainstream tradition in australia. It is celebrated by neo-pagans only. These are fringe groups who choose to celbrate an archaic tradition that is currently recognized as christmas. The fact that this small group of people (how many can they be, 100?) does this not negate the fact that Yule means christmas. Are you saying that a think-piece written by the author of ""The Christian Living and Apologetics Website"" is a good source for the historic origin of christmas? He doesn`t even bring up the year the bishop in Rome declared 24th of december to be the birthdate of christ or how it relates to the celebration of the Roman god Saturn... Or all of it`s connections to various other pagan festivities around the world... I`m sorry, but I don`t consider that link as an authoritive on anything other than Eric Knickerbockers own viewpoint and memories of christmas.","holiday-trees","07:01 PM","government-debates","44"
"12-12-2005","7023",3,"Steeeeve","None","You all seem to be missing the point. No Christian value = no Christmas holiday. If we were a Muslim nation we wouldn't have Christmas. If we had no religion we wouldn't have Christmas (as a national holiday that is). In fact, if you didn't ahve christiantity, guess what, no Christmas. It doesn't get much more religious then that. If you want to claim that Christmas doesn't have much of a religious meaning anymore you can but at the same time you can't complain about ""In God We Trust"" or ""One Nation Under God"" because those are just as embedded in our society as Christmas is. Oh, and yes I know Jesus wasn't born on Dec 25th which is why I said ""remember"" instead of ""born on"". Yes, I also know people work on Christmas, Waffle House is open .","zachvac","184869","But you seem to be missing the point I made. I have no problem with Christianity in general, the problem is when it is put in the government. This includes ""One Nation under God"" as well as ""In God we Trust"". If a business wants to make people work on Christmas, it's their choice. If they want to fire people for taking Christmas off, that's their choice. Most employers give their employees off because they know that they wouldn't come to work anyway and they would lose money staying open on Christmas, but many retail stores don't think that way and make lots of money on Christmas.","holiday-trees","09:19 PM","government-debates","45"
