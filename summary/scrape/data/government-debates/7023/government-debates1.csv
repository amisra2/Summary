How are Christmas trees part of the religious holliday anyway? I don't care if they call them Christmas trees, but I also don't care if they want to call them holiday trees. ""A rose by any other name stinks as much"".","holiday-trees","10:36 PM","government-debates","2"

Non Christians celebrate Christmas. Its recognized as a federal holiday so it should not be taken away. The liberals think they are getting back at the right-wing Christians, but they are not. ITs pathetic, its a Christmas tree, dradles are not holiday tops they are dradles, manorahs are not holiday candle holders, they are manorahs. And if the companies are doing it for money to please all people, they are loosing oney becuase the number of people that celebrate Chistmas in this country is 96%. So this Christmas bashing is bad for everyone, Liberals look dumb when they try to support these Christmas hating companies, Christmas celebrators dont get the joy of their holiday.","holiday-trees","01:16 AM","government-debates","3"

Heck if it p.o.'s an evangelical, I will start calling them X-MAS trees.","holiday-trees","06:37 AM","government-debates","4"

I don't understand why everyone's getting so afraid of saying Christmas anymore. But what's also annoying is how Christians have another thing to whine and gripe about. Call it Christmas, call it a holiday tree, do whatever you want, I don't care. Hell, I call the tree my family has had the solstice bush. Any problems there? I hope not.","holiday-trees","07:41 AM","government-debates","5"

I guess we should be saying Holidaymas. The people that are offended by ""Christmas Tree"" need to stop being a the Grinch, grow a back bone, and move to France.","holiday-trees","10:43 PM","government-debates","7"

The history of festivals around the time of winter may do, but that's not the same as Christmas. If you want to celebrate Yule or whatever then that's entirely up to you, but it ain't Christmas.","holiday-trees","05:19 AM","government-debates","9"

But I agree that the pagan festival is very different from the christian festival we currently celebrate. On the other hand, I would say that christmas has changed considerably the last few decades as well. In many households around the world, the christian meaning of christmas is simply not a part of their christmas celebrations. I would also like to point out that getting smashed and beat up your wife and kids seems to be a universal christmas tradition, even among devout christians. So I guess the pagan ritual of drinking ""jul"" at the winter solstice is more prelavent than the christian meanings and rituals","holiday-trees","07:05 AM","government-debates","10"

I would say increased alcohol consumption is a big culprit. Even though, stress, failed expectations and the fact that people are free from their work to socialize with their families are probably significant factors as well.","holiday-trees","09:30 AM","government-debates","12"

No matter how you slice is, it is putting ""religion"" into government. Of course, people aren't going to say we should just get rid of the holiday 100%, they would rather change it to Holiday Trees in order to still get off of work.

During the communist era, many religous holidays where removed from the calender in order to further the bolsjevik propaganda. Instead, ideological holidays where introduced (like the birthday of Lenin and what-not). When the wall came tumbling down, the russians where not prepared to let go of their communist-hollidays, while they fought fiercily to get the religous hollidays back into the calender (with the payed days-off naturally, you cannot worship your god unless you get a salary for it). So now, they have two sets of holidays, and twice as many as before. And sure, it is selfish. Just like expecting that the free time you get during christians hollidays should be payed for by your employer. We are all selfish.","holiday-trees","09:38 AM","government-debates","15"
