"12-13-2005","7023",5,"Steeeeve","None","I already did. Your congressional record is for DC only...if you don't realize that then we can't go on, it says it right there in the link you provided. ""The intention is that it shall apply only to the Distric of Columbia"" Said over and over. Not only that, proclaiming a holiday can be done by president (see link in my last post). Morever, look at Lincolns Address and tell me that wasn't religious. Christmas is very obvious...They made a holiday on Christmas day, your argument would be like saying the 4th of July is not really to celebrate our independence. You are just fooling yourself into thinking overwise and I wonder why you couldn't fool yourself with ""In God We Trust""....maybe that had no religous meaning too :-/. yeah right.","doG","185092","The District of Columbia is the only Federal municipality in the nation but it's holidays set the legal holidays for all federal employees, nothing more, nothing less. That is the only act of Congress that has anything to do with declaring the 4 days it names as Federal Holidays. The fact that Congress declared the 25th of December a holiday and the fact that you celebrate Christmas on the 25th of December does not mean Congress declared Christmas a holiday. That a President can proclaim a holiday has nothing to do with Acts of Congress. Who cares if Lincoln's address was religious. The 1st Amendment says, "" Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion..."". It was illegal for Congress to pass a law declaring the existance of a deity in placing the term ""In God We Trust"" on currency and placing the words ""under God"" in the pledge. All of your diversionary XXXX about holidays cannot change this. Congress has done what the 1st Amendmend inhibits it from doing.","holiday-trees","09:32 PM","government-debates","61"
"12-13-2005","7023",5,"Steeeeve","None","Exactly, Christmas was done because it is a religious holiday and Thanksgiving was done as a holiday for God as shown in Lincolns address.","doG","185093","No, Christmas was not done. The Act of Congress specifically made the 25th of December a holiday.","holiday-trees","09:34 PM","government-debates","62"

Holiday Tree Personally, I do not care (and believe that all others should also not care) what any symbol of Christmas (=Christ Day) is called. I call 'em Christmas trees. As has been pointed out in previous posts, the use of Christmas Tree has been around for ages. Regardless of the origin of the tree name, its relation to the holiday of Christmas, or the similarities between Christmas and other holidays, there is little if any sound logic for changing the name just to appease those who are selfishly offended by its use. I believe the relatively recent drive to remove Christmas from the public view (and to remove all vestiges of religious symbols from public property and currency) is driven by a need of those overly sensitive non-believers to deprive the MAJORITY of the earths peoples of their right to hold on to completely harmless traditions and heretofore LEGALLY permitted embossments. Being offended by what others choose to name various symbols is childish, selfish and divisive.","holiday-trees","09:35 PM","government-debates","63"

No. The people do not have a right to emboss the national currency with their belief. The Constitution specifically prohibits Congress from passing laws that show a religious preference. Any law declaring that a deity exists do just this.","holiday-trees","09:52 PM","government-debates","64"

We are a Constitutional Republic. The minority as well as the majority has rights, but the government doesn't. The government has very limited power, limited to only what is given to them in the Constitution and even further limited by the Bill of Rights. You say you have the right to hold on to completely harmless traditions? Fine. Do it. Do you really need the government to continue your harmless traditions?","holiday-trees","10:19 PM","government-debates","65"

The law applies to DC and that is all. They didn't mention federal employees everywhere, read your own stuff. Not only that, they make a law every year declaring the holidays. Just like the link I posted earlier. Post facts, not opinions. Other than Lincoln was the reason why Thanksgiving was proclaimed a national holiday...Thanksgiving became a national holiday when Lincoln proclaimed it. Christmas becamse a national holiday when Grant proclaimed it (2 days? after your legislation). Yeah, it wasn't illegal, just like it wasn't illegal to make thanksgiving a day for praising God as Lincoln said. You make it seem like proclaiming a holiday means nothing... Who do you think makes a national holiday? The president. Your legislation deals with federal holidays which are decided each year (for example this year the 26th is a federal holiday). Why you don't seem to get this I don't know. In the end, our national holidays of Christmas and Thanksgiving are religious based or done for religious reasons (such as thanksgiving). If you have a problem with that then maybe you should take it up in courts...however, good luck getting that one erased. I present facts here and you just are presenting opinion.","holiday-trees","11:46 PM","government-debates","66"

I am not ignoring the fact that many of the founding fathers were religious or claiming that they intended any exclusion of God from the country. You are ignoring the fact that the 1st Amendment states, "" Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.... "" No laws, none, nada, zip, zilch, etc.. The acts that placed the term ""God"" on US currency and in the Pledge were laws passed by Congress. That has nothing to do with the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, only the plain text prohibition of government's endorsement of religion that they themselves placed in the Constitution. A US coin with no reference to God is not an atheist coin or one that denies God, it is a secular coin. A coin that references God or specifically claims there is no God is a coin that is not secular, being either deist or atheist. Producing currency without acknowledging God is not excluding God from the country, it is simply a restraint of the country, as a nation, declaring God's existence. The same with the Pledge. Before the addition of the words ""under God"", the Pledge was not an exclusion of God or a declaration that God did not exist. It was simply secular. Adding those words make the Pledge a declaration as a nation that there is a deity. That is an endorsement for belief, without them, it is not.","holiday-trees","08:33 AM","government-debates","73"
