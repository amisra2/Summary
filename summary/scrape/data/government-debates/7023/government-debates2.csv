However, I have no problem with ""Happy Holidays"". Saying ""Merry Christmas"" to people you don't know is making an ASSumption. But it's all freedom of speech, anyone can use whichever they want, and anyone trying to force others to use thier term is nothing more than an authoritarian.","holiday-trees","12:16 PM","government-debates","17"

That christians elected to celebrate their religious holiday at the same time did not change the soltice celebration of others to a religious one.","holiday-trees","01:06 PM","government-debates","18"

I agree on the other point though, it is a Christmas Tree, not a holiday tree. Germany is credited with starting the Christmas tree tradition as we now know it in the 16th century when devout Christians brought decorated trees into their homes during the winter solstice celebration. For those that are interested I recommend the History of Christmas by the History Channel. Maybe such silly quibbling over Christmas vs Holiday would go away if more people learn just a little more about the cultures of others. Christmas is both a secular and a religious holiday depending on the celebrant.","holiday-trees","01:17 PM","government-debates","19"

It may be that others celebrated something else at the same time (Winter solstice for example), but that's not Christmas. ""Christmas"" is a religious holiday; there's no way around it. Others may celebrate other things at the same time, but those things aren't Christmas. ""Christmas"" (or 'Christ mass') is pretty much understood to be celebrating the birth of Christ. In the immortal words of Linus in a Charlie Brown Christmas . . . . ""that's what Christmas is all about, Charlie Brown.""","holiday-trees","01:24 PM","government-debates","20"
"12-10-2005","7023",2,"None","None","None","Ooaman","184467","The chances are high that Jesus wasn't even born in the (Greecko-Roman*) December but more like in September. Christmas itself didn't come around until about 400 A.D. Even then it was in major controversy because many Christians believed that celebrating one's birthday was something that the pagans did. It was finally placed in December simply because that was when the winter solstice was. Okay, now I know that's not what the main point of this is but I thought I'd give a little history. Now I don't know about Christmas in other countries, but in America it has become commercialized. (For example, the concept we have of Santa Claus was based upon a Coke ad. Santa Claus, or actually St. Nick, was a Turkish man back I believe in the 900's A.D. who did some good deeds by tossing coins in the window of some man so he wouldn't have to sell his 3 daughters into slavery and quite possibly prostitution to help pay a debt. I could almost assume that if Christmas were held in August or September, Santa would be wearing a Speedo instead of a red suit.) Now I don't believe that this is a liberal VS concervative thing. This is typical American business not making a good choice and then is confused when people question what they are doing. This happens a lot. *I'm not sure of the proper spelling but I'm sure you know I'm referring to the calender.","holiday-trees","01:28 PM","government-debates","21"

Indeed, this is the only meaning of ""Yule"" accepted by either the full Oxford English Dictionary or the Concise Oxford Dictionary, and people unfamiliar with ancient pagan traditions will not distinguish between Yule and Christmas.","holiday-trees","02:04 PM","government-debates","22"

St. Nicholas, a monk born sometime around 280 A.D. in Patara, near Myra in modern-day Turkey and much admired for his piety and kindness, made his first inroads into American popular culture towards the end of the 18th century. In December 1773, and again in 1774, a New York newspaper reported that groups of Dutch families had gathered to honor the anniversary of his death. The name Santa Claus evolved from Nick's Dutch nickname, Sinter Klaas, a shortened form of Sint Nikolaas (Dutch for Saint Nicholas).

The fact remains that they only reason you don't work on Dec 25 is because that is the day of remebering the birth of Jesus and the US government decided to declare it a holiday.

You did read the rest of my post didn't you? I went on to say that the true Santa Claus was a Turkish man. Okay, so I was wrong with the decade. What if I were to say that they way we in-vision Santa Claus here in America is based off of an early coke ad. And if not a coke ad, then at least through the poem ""The Night Before Christmas."" Now I don't know what Americans before the late 1800's viewed Santa Claus as looking like, but the view we in America have of him now as that fat man with the red suit and hat on with a white beard came from a mixture of an early coke ad and the poem I mentioned. There is no doubt in my mind that he looked entirely different in real life. If he were born in Turkey, he would have probably had a darker grayer beard for one thing. Okay fine, what is considered modern-day Turkey. But that wasn't my main point. My main point was that in this country, Christmas has become very much commercialized.","holiday-trees","05:59 PM","government-debates","26"

Employers can give their employees Christmas off, or not. Stores are still open on Christmas, right? I'm flying on an airplane this Christmas, the airports are open. Many people don't get it off. Christmas is NOT the birth of Jesus, as mentioned earlier. And in terms of the reason? I would say it's more because most people celebrate Christmas. If the government didn't have it as a holliday, they would have to spend money to stay open, but not have as many workers. Most people get New Year's Day off too. They can give some days off, so if they didn't give Christmas off most likely they would pick another day.","holiday-trees","09:30 PM","government-debates","27"

No Christian value = no Christmas holiday. If we were a Muslim nation we wouldn't have Christmas. If we had no religion we wouldn't have Christmas (as a national holiday that is). In fact, if you didn't ahve christiantity, guess what, no Christmas. It doesn't get much more religious then that. If you want to claim that Christmas doesn't have much of a religious meaning anymore you can but at the same time you can't complain about ""In God We Trust"" or ""One Nation Under God"" because those are just as embedded in our society as Christmas is. Oh, and yes I know Jesus wasn't born on Dec 25th which is why I said ""remember"" instead of ""born on"". Yes, I also know people work on Christmas, Waffle House is open .","holiday-trees","11:40 PM","government-debates","28"

The winter solstice celebration, ""Yule"", dates back more than 4000 years, long before the birth of any alleged jesus. FWIW, President Grant declared Christmas a holiday as a gesture of good will toward men at the same time that he declared New Year's a holiday.","holiday-trees","12:28 AM","government-debates","30"
