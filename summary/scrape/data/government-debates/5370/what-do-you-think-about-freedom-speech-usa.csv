You see, after that story with Newsweek and American army abusing the Koran to enrage prisoners there followed strong measures from FBI. They were ordered to find those guilty and intercept phone messages. Isnt it shocking? Do they call it freedom of speech? Moreover Washington wants to impose such practice on its allies in Eastern Europe. Take changes in Latvian Electron Coupling Act authorized by local parliament for example. It was tined to Bushs visit in Latvia. Can you imagine that telecommunicational operators tracing all Latvian citizens phone calls and e-mail? And now these private entrepreneurs have loose their purse strings to buy necessary gear. Marvelously, isnt it?","what-do-you-think-about-freedom-speech-usa","02:16 AM","government-debates","1"

Edgar Hoover used to intimidate and blackmail law-abiding citizens using information gleaned ostensibly for security. In a perfect world, the law-abiding citizen wouldn't have anything to fear. But since we're not in a perfect world, and these things can be abused, the law-abiding citizen has reasons for fear. These things can be abused to advance their controllers' political agenda at the expense of those without such resources.","what-do-you-think-about-freedom-speech-usa","03:20 PM","government-debates","8"

The federal government, using threats of withholding shared revenue in a political system increasingly dependent on government funds with a declining tax base, has eliminated states rights on a methodical basis to a point where individual states now retain little effective legislative power to govern any standards from education to law enforcement. Apathy and poor leadership are a dangerous combination in a federal republic.","what-do-you-think-about-freedom-speech-usa","07:21 PM","government-debates","9"

The left would impose ""political correctness"" on what we would say but unless ""hate crimes"" legislation becomes law they are just flapping their gums. A lot of this hysteria is aimed at the Patriot Act coming out of 9/11. Those people have no historical perspective or they would have realized that during our Civil War, WWI and WWII, there were definite limits on what could be said and done. Today, for all intents an purposes, we can say anything we want to do. Of course one cannot accuse another person of something that is untrue without running the risk of libel.","what-do-you-think-about-freedom-speech-usa","11:26 PM","government-debates","10"

Saying it's ok to have impeachments on freedoms now is ok, because there were worse ones in the past, is like telling the victim of a racist beating it's ok, because at least unlike 100years ago he's not dead. -Wez","what-do-you-think-about-freedom-speech-usa","03:36 PM","government-debates","13"
