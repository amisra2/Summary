I believe voters should determine what they believe to be the political positions that best benefit our nation. Party is of primary consideration only to persons that have greater allegiance to political party rather than the nation. Voters should apply their best judgments, determining for are THEIR preferable position(s) upon issue(s). Voters should prioritize and vote for the candidate that best advances the position(s) that THEY determined to be of utmost national importance. I happen to like both my Democratic congressman and president Obama but Im not married to either one of them and Im not in love with them. Im a populist that has voted in every general election since 1959 and Ive missed voting in extremely few Democratic primary elections. Obama has acquiesced and surrendered too much without good reason rather than negotiating for the best deal he could have obtained. Obama has demonstrated lesser concern for the positions within the issues that I believe are to our nations best interests. I believe hes agreeable to those positions but he doesnt share or even approach my degree of commitment to those positions. Obama has surrendered too much to Republicans and Democratic Blue Dogs rather than honorably negotiating for the best deal he could have reasonably obtained. Hes was able to do that because he believes that hes entitled to my vote and I have no other alternative. Theres a Green Party candidate for U.S. Congress within my district. Her professed positions are equally if not more aligned (than those of the Democrat congressmans positions), to my own political positions. My vote for her demonstrates to all potential candidates of future elections that my vote might be obtained if their positions were more aligned with those of the Green Party. If there were no candidate for congress in this 2010 election that even approached my political positions on what I believe are important issues, Id abstain from voting for any of the U.S. Congressional candidates. Unfortunately this does not send an equally explicit message. In both of these cases, I'm not voting for the candidates that have any reasonable prospect of being elected. My vote or lack of a vote is not squandered because Im doing what little that I can to induce a more superior political landscape in future elections. I believe my positions with regard to the political issues and the advancement of those positions are of greater importance than party affiliations. I have considered the risk of the Republican candidate being elected to Congress and additional House votes that will be contrary to what I advocate. The alternative is my Congressional district being represented by a Democratic empty suit that does not share my commitment to the positions I advocate. The elections of tepid supporters of what I advocate are more rather than less likely to induce Republican policies being our nation's only policies. Im comfortable with my vote for the Green Party candidate. Respectfully, Supposn","2010-i-wont-vote","06:52 PM","government-debates","16"
