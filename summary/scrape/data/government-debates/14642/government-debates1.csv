"09-25-2010","14642",1,"None","None","None","Supposn","413629","The Democratic Party has decided to wait until after the elections to vote upon the tax cuts. I fully support Obamas position that we cannot afford to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest taxpayers. Id prefer that the discounted tax rates for long term capital gains incomes be eliminated and replaced with more populist tax cuts. Since 1959 after leaving the service, Ive voted in every general election and have missed very few primary elections. I will wait until the tax bill is brought to the floors of both U.S. Congressional houses and is brought to a floor vote in the House of Representatives before I vote in a general election. This is my 74th year. Finally in 2008 I stopped voting for the least evil and determined that I require a candidate at minimum substantially concur with my opinion upon at least one issue and methods to achieve our perceived goal. I wont absolutely always vote for a candidate that simply only meets my minimum standard. Obamas speaks well on the issues but lacks explicit explanation of how he prefers the laws should be drafted to achieve specific goals. His campaign office has written, (but Ive never actually found a direct quote from Obama), that he was a proponent of the federal minimum wage tied to a cost of living adjustment, (i.e. COLA). Based upon that minimal but substantial agreement I voted for Obama. I fear that true to his normal behavior, Obama and the Democrats will acquiesce to Republicans. If the minimum is increased, The Democrats will not press for it being thereafter COLAd. A COLAd minimum wage rate will not substantially improve USAs economy but it is certainly an improvement of a non-COLAd minimum wage. Any significant federal minimum wage is preferable to an ineffective minimum wage. I suppose it is feasible for a minimum wage rate to be excessive and detrimental to an economy. The greater harm occurs within jurisdictions adjoining others having inadequate wage scales and goods and persons have unrestricted passage over their borders. I have never encountered a historical reference to a nations economy being harmed by an excessively great minimum wage. I dont believe theres ever been an excessive minimum wage within any nation. Obama is the titular head of the Democratic Party. Obama and our nation were lucky he achieved anything. It was due to chance rather than political competence that gave our nation comparatively less superior health insurance legislation. I am not angry because of what he and his party failed to achieve. Im furious of what positions he surrendered without fully negotiating for anything better. Politics is not a dirty word and negotiation is respectable. Acquiescence and submission are despicable words and are generally cowardly and despicable acts. It is my patriotic duty not to vote for a party that leads in the wrong direction or a second party that lacks leadership and has no definite direction. The Republicans will lead us until we recognize that its the wrong direction. Retaining no consistency of direction, Democrats will are unable to correct our nations course. I will not vote for any Democrats until Obama and his party finds and retain some courage. Thus far it appears that I will not vote for Obama in 2012.

They raised taxes on the rich in New York and a lot of them left the state, including Rush Limbaugh. Even the mayor of NY admitted they screwed up. Revenues to the state actually went down. STUPID. All the rich do when they get a new tax levied against them is spend their time figuring out ways to avoid the taxes, instead of investing the money in new business ventures, R&D, bonds, etc. Sometimes they move their money offshore, like the Clinton's did, to avoid taxes. Sometimes they leave the country entirely. And when you tax the corporations they usually just pass the expense down to the little guy in the form of increased prices for goods and services. You may remember when the liberals did a 10% ""get the rich"" (surcharge) tax on yachts. Well, the rich quit buying them for the most part and the yacht companies started going broke. They had to start laying off the little guy and taxes to Uncle Sam suffered because business stunk. So the little guy took it in the shorts, along with Uncle Sam. STUPID. The little guy is the one who usually gets screwed when liberals start their new programs. Welfare created the welfare state. $400 stipends for the homeless in San Francisco brought every bum across America into their back yard. Crime and violence went up and people suffered. Liberals are either ignorant of these things or they just keep pumping the same dead horse thinking they might get a new outcome next time. Now they're spending money like drunken sailors and running up an enormous debt that's going to cost $600 billion or more a year just to pay the interest on the debt.

The issue is the overly taxing that begins with our working poor and reaches up from there to all of our middle income earners. It is they rather than the rich that are being overly taxed. The bush administration has shifted greater portions of the federal tax burden upon those who earn the least incomes.

"10-07-2010","14642",1,"None","None","None","Symbiote","414599","The democrats did have a marginally better record on responsibility (although Clinton's was largely a combination of gridlock and creative accounting), up until Obama. Obama apparently decided voter repudiation of Bush's warmongering and overspending was a ringing endorsement of his plans for overspending and warmongering. Obama has a much worse track record on fiscal responsibility than any other president with the possible exception of Bush. Obama has more partisan excuses for the spending, but he also is or at least should be more immediately aware of the catastrophic outcome this path will lead the US on. Incidentally, we do have such a crystal ball - it's called economics, and it's very good at telling us what happens when stimulus generates a bubble, which is why the likes of Ron Paul and Peter Schiff were able to see it coming, and it's very good at telling us what happens when that bubble bursts. It's also very good at telling us what happens when the bubble isn't allowed to burst, and instead the government keeps the zombie industries going that were riding on it.

The Democrats do not generally concur and stand for anything explicit. My Democratic Congressman is a candidate in 2010. He follows Obamas example. A politician has to know what he wants, what he can reasonably expect to negotiate and what will he himself has determined to be his absolute last possible line of resistance. Thats the line beyond which there should be no retreat without a battle because further retreat is much more costly than the battle losses. Obama has acquiesced, and retreated too much. The Democratic Senate leader must have urinated in his trousers due to his fear of a Republican filibuster regarding a tax bill. Harry Reid should have welcomed the opportunity to run his re-election campaign on that issue. It doesnt matter which candidate wins the contested Nevada seat in the U.S. Senate; Nevada and our nation will not be well represented from that seat. I believe that if that a reformed Democratic Party or a third party that will actually strive to oppose the Republicans platforms are (for the benefit of our nation) are the only alternatives to Republican policies becoming our entire national policies.

Obama inherited a 83.4 % debt/GDP .. he didn't create this mess. If we're lucky by the end of his first term we will see the debt start to go down again. The Problem is that most Conservatives would rather cast blame on a Democrat than to admit that the Republican party is the one spending like there's no tomorrow. Once the Bush Tax cuts are reversed in January you will see a turn around in the economy. A 3 % increase to the richest 2 % of the country isn't going to cause anything except healing what Bush has destroyed over his 8 years . Obama will turn it around if given the chance, he's only had 2 years to work with ...","daewoo","416877","Obama has done nothing AT ALL to indicate he intends to ""turn it around"". He is as bad, or worse, than Bush when it comes to spending. And that is if we are as foolish as whoever wrote the article you quoted and believe that the president is actually responsible for all that spending. He isnt. While the president does submit a budget to congress, what he gets back from them is not, and has not for the last 50 years bee, what he sent them. There is absolutely no possibility that the Bush tax cuts being reversed are going to result in a turnaround in the economy. It is WAY to little WAY too late. At this point the Bush tax cuts are a drop in the bucket.","2010-i-wont-vote","05:58 PM","government-debates","15"
