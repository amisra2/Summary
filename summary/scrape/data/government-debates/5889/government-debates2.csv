It's never bothered me. In fact I do find a very few admirable traits of the enemy - radical Islamists. They seem to be very committed to family, they have a serious conviction to their cause (spreading radical Islam throughout the world, and this is why they must be TAKEN seriously), also they certainly are not politically correct pistol whipped into submission by their own press. What your misdirection this has to do with a numbskull flag burner getting a well deserved arse whoopin', I haven't a clue.","fate-flag-burnners","10:12 PM","government-debates","16"

"07-06-2005","5889",2,"Heads_On_Pikes","None","Flag burners are not neccessarily traitors. Granted, they're a little goofy at least but most can be treated for their mental illness.","Matthew S","145040","And so can you. They do offer addiction therepy.

"07-07-2005","5889",2,"Heads_On_Pikes","None","Hahaha, you forgot the /sarcasm tag. Hey, it's the chance one takes when one ****** off a gathering of real Americans. I wonder why he was a Marine for only two years?","zachvac","145352","Of course, because real Americans wouldn't let other people actually exercise the rights they brag about, would they?

Otherwise, let the unAmerican idiot have their little display. They are about as poignant as a sewage pipe, and any supposed 'message' is lost. So let them burn their copy of the flag, it does not matter. The real symbol is not desecrated, and they are outed as the hidden XXXXX they have always been. Too stupid to form real words, they burn an effigy.","fate-flag-burnners","08:53 AM","government-debates","23"

Flag burning is not a specified right and to attempt argue it is covered under ""freedom of speech"" is quite a reach.","fate-flag-burnners","07:37 PM","government-debates","26"
