"07-07-2005","5889",3,"Heads_On_Pikes","None","It's his ""right"" to burn a flag in the middle of a large gathering of people?? Flag burning is not a specified right and to attempt argue it is covered under ""freedom of speech"" is quite a reach.","zachvac","145733","He doesn't need a right to do something. We are allowed to do anything unless it is prohibited and flag burning is not prohibited. As long as he got a permit or it was on his own property, he has the right to do whatever he damn well pleases with his own property and an attack should be treated as an unprovoked assult. People seem to think that a real American would kick their butts, yet then they claim that the soldiers are fighting for these freedoms. You can't have it both ways, either soldiers are fighting for a big-government who bans stuff because it's offensive or they fight for freedom, but most Conservatives (not all, only the XXXXXX with no real idea of freedom like Voice Of Reason) say that the troops are fighting for freedom and that we shouldn't actually use that freedom, that would be a profanity against the troops. I'm sorry but they fought for the right to do whatever you want to as long as it doesn't impede on anyone else's right and any real American would realize that to beat someone up for exercising the right fought for by the troops is the worst act against freedom they can do. These people should be arrested and thrown in jail for assult, this isn't a country where people get to make attacks because they are offended. They should be treated just like any other mob that attacked a single person without reason. This is not a country where people get to take justice into their own hands. Any police force that arrests the burner and not the people commiting the real crime is just as bad as the people commiting the assult. A real American would take it like a man and restrain themselves. People like this are no better than little kids ""but he was making fun of me, I had to beat him up"".","fate-flag-burnners","10:39 PM","government-debates","32"
"07-07-2005","5889",3,"Voice Of Reason","None","You wouldn't burn one in front of me.........We both know that........","zachvac","145734","I would burn one in front of anyone. I can't really go to the Pacific Northwest or Florida (still don't get where exactly you do live, but it really doesn't matter). I really don't plan on burning a flag unless there really is an ammendment passed, in which case I will do it in protest before it goes into effect. But if you are going to challenge me to do it, I will do it, only unlike Mathew S, I would return VoR's assults punch for punch, it's called self defense. So I could beat him into the ground before having him arrested for assult.","fate-flag-burnners","10:43 PM","government-debates","33"
"07-07-2005","5889",3,"Eddie","None","I would say it is ""his"" right to be free from violence from a large gathering of people.","Heads_On_Pikes","145737","When HE is putting others in danger because he has a wild hair up his arse? The funniest thing is, not only did he get his clock cleaned, HE was arrested to boot. That's what I call good police work!","fate-flag-burnners","10:48 PM","government-debates","34"

If he didn't get a permit to burn it he should be arrested, but a just police force would be arresting the people commiting the actual crime (assult).","fate-flag-burnners","10:53 PM","government-debates","35"

Then they start runnin, get some gasoline on all the other flag burners in their flag burnin cult, and then whadya know, the whole damn citys on fire, everyones runnin around and then, we bomb them, they die, our flag lives happily ever after until the next Bush comes into presidency.","fate-flag-burnners","12:49 AM","government-debates","36"

The problem is that he didn't do this on his property or with a permit. So you're suggesting that in a public display such as this, an attack would be OK. Obviously you have no idea of the concept of provocation, nor of the concept of assault. That's OK, don't let the facts get in the way of your rhetoric.","fate-flag-burnners","09:46 AM","government-debates","38"

I'm referring to the fact that the people posting wouldn't have had a problem if he had gotten a permit first and he was attacked by the citizens and the police. I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know the fine details about what is provocation, but the ""he started it"" argument usually doesn't hold up unless it's self defense. I doubt these people attacking the flag burner could be classified as self defense.","fate-flag-burnners","12:25 AM","government-debates","39"
