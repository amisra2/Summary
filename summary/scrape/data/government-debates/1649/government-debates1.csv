Anyway I feel that the right wants what is best for the country, because they want to lower taxs and I think that is a good thing. The left however wants from what I have heard anyway wants to rise mainly the rich peoples taxs(I am not rich by the way), and that is just redickulas what I think the left is missing is that they EARN that money, now some make the arugument that some people inharite that money and thats true but if they don't save that or invest it right, that money will be gone in a couple of months same goes for people who inharit companys if the don't run it properly it will ethier go bankurpt or they will lose control of that company. I will end by saying in my opioion atleast rich people shouldn't pay any more taxs then middle classed people or poor people.","political-stance-helps-country-more","06:28 PM","government-debates","6"

I am asking because since this is a debate, I thought, and not just a place to express opinions, I would like to know exactly what you mean in order for me to question or agree with your statement. So, more specifically to your statement, in what ways do Republican policies strive to create a functioning society while Democratic policies on the other hand only try to create an unachievable utopia? I guess I feel the need for some things that are kind of specific, otherwise the debate is in danger of turning into a 'democrats are good, and republicans are bad' type of debate. Such a debate, I feel, yields nothing. Again, sorry for not being clear on my question...if this did not clear up my intent, please let me know.","political-stance-helps-country-more","06:54 PM","government-debates","7"

I agree that is a major difference between the right and left. The left does feel, I believe, that the rich should pay more than the poor. I do disagree, however, with your statement about how hard it is for the rich to stay rich. Capitalism is based upon the premise that wealth creates more wealth. True companies go bankrupt and lose money. But I ask how often the CEO, etc. actually become poor from this? Also, what do you mean exactly by rich people shouldn't pay more? For example, simply that we should take the budget of the US, and divide it by the population, and eveyone pay the same amount? Again, thanks, and welcome to the forum. -Dan","political-stance-helps-country-more","07:01 PM","government-debates","8"
"02-05-2004","1649",1,"None","None","None","AMD4EVER","33918","OK, well democrats favor things such as gay marriage, taxes on the rich to give to the poor, higher tax rates, open borders, larger government, smaller military, internationalism, pro environment, anti death penalty, and most of all social justice. Basically this seems to me to show that the democrats believe that large government can do better than small government, if everyone had the same amount of money it would be good, the environment is more important than business, and our country should be open to everyone. These are all very idealistic things that in theory if they all worked would create a wonderful society. If we could simply just open our borders to everyone and have it work out just dandy that would be great. If we could have a clean environment while having businesses be successful that would be great. If the poor could just take money from the rich to improve their lives which not affecting the rich people's lifestyle that would be great. If the government actually was efficient enough and successful enough to be able to spend our money better than individuals can spend their money and use this to improve all our lives that would be great. The democrats are idealistic in my view and perhaps one day they will be able to achieve their goals and make this dream of theirs come true. However their long term plan is one that I cannot see them succeeding on if they were given control of the country today. Republicans however seem to try to do what they can for society and basically allow individuals and businesses do the rest. Capitalism works in such as way that this can be successful right now. The only reason the government even needs to be in place is to uphold the laws and control the military. Other than that the society would simply run all by itself without any help. That is basically my view of what the republicans are trying to do and it seems realistic to me. It will of course hurt the environment and not solve world hunger anytime soon but it is at least a good plan based on the governments current capabilities. But don't get me wrong here, I'm not saying all republicans think this way and clearly Bush does not and clearly Clinton was not the democrat that I speak of here. I'm just talking about the goals of the average republican and average democrat and assuming they had 100% control over the country. I think the democrat government would try to control more than they had the ability to control and society would fall apart because of their vision while the republican government would allow the American society to continue on. Still, the best thing for the US may just be that a mix of democrats and republicans hold office and both sides are compeitively trying to help the society. In that way we can get the best of both sides.","political-stance-helps-country-more","08:06 AM","government-debates","9"

I also think that much of what is 'right' is a matter of opinion, but I I do believe that on most social issues, whether they are right or wrong forthe nation, and the world for that matter is moving, has been moving, and will continue to move in a direction more in line with the stances of the Democratic party. I guess I mean primarily in what I consider to be mostly civil rights issues. For example, The civil rights movement in the 60's I think most would agree was an issue championed much more by Dems than Republicans. Currently, gay rights, for example...I mean does anyone really think that in 100 years gay people aren't going to be allowed to marry?","political-stance-helps-country-more","12:45 AM","government-debates","11"
"03-25-2004","1649",1,"None","None","None","Ghost","40954","I think AMD hit the nail on the head: conservatives want a functioning government and society now, liberals want a utopia. I think that you do need a balance of both, but I do think that conservatism helps our country more. Liberals tend to go the way of appeasement, complete tolerance (which is not a good thing, despite what you hear in school), and cooperation with the UN. Conservatives seem to be much more of confronting enemies and evil head on, they're don't really believe in total tolerance (which is a good thing really, but very very dangerous), and are more independent in a national way.","political-stance-helps-country-more","03:11 AM","government-debates","12"

Left or right, liberalalism, conservatism or socialism can all be very pragmatic or idealistic. While I would agree that conservatism as an ideology might be more inclined to be pragmatic, conservative parties can range from strong idealistic fringe party to pragmatic governing party.","political-stance-helps-country-more","09:03 AM","government-debates","14"

It has been my experience that in general. liberals seem to be more idealistic while republicans tend to be more realistic (though there seems to be a new breed of fascist republican out there that is not as realistic). Idealism is fine, but you can only look at so many pretty pictures before you have to eat.","political-stance-helps-country-more","01:24 PM","government-debates","15"
