I noticed that the lock on my storage building has the brand name ""American Lock Company"" but a close examination reveals the ""China"" on the back.

Their business ethic is ""make money, screw everybody else"" It was a sad day for US industry when the chinese figured out they could trade limited access to their consumer market for technology. Japans drive for mechanization of their factories took 20 years. The chinese did it in 5, and Ford paid the lions share of the bill for it. Better get to market quick. In another 5 years, the chinese will dominate our high tech markets. Already they have taken over 40% of the consumer electronics market (largely due to sales through Wal Mart). Their other favorite trick seems to be providing manufatured products to be sold under an American label. Butler buildings are now mostly made in china. Not long ago I was at a place in kansas city called RSO (they sell salvaged freight) and they had 2 pallet of Crane cam shafts. Point of origin ont he shipping label was Beijing. It is getting to the point that everyting is like the automotive industry, where ""made in America"" is either very subjective or a downright farce. A Ford truck built in a canadian factory is an American car. A Toyoto built in Indiana is apparently not. I never would have believed that Crane was getting their cams from china had I not seen it myself (OR, they could have been chinese knockoffs....another of chinas favorite tricks). In 1979 Crane Cams became an employee-owned company, assembling and implementing an Employee Stock Ownership plan. The ESOP makes each one of its 300+ employees true employee-owners with a stake in their companys future and the empowerment to help grow their company. http://www.cranecams.com/?show=history","JPSartre12","89103","I did a little research on Crane because I remembered them advertising the fact that they were US Made in the past. From what I can gather, all of their camshafts are made in Daytona Beach, FL. Also from their website""Although it is not commonly known, Crane Cams also provides about 95% of the 8620 steel billet, carburized cam cores used by all racing cam companies."" I wonder if what you saw were Crane Cam blanks.","political-stance-helps-country-more","01:17 PM","government-debates","167"

The chinese are notorious for turning out good quality knockoffs. some of the golf clubs they turn out as knockoffs hit better than the ""real"" ones.","political-stance-helps-country-more","01:48 PM","government-debates","168"

Japanese and European engineering is highly, highly over-rated. I could tell you some stories that would curl your hair. Suffice it to say that all 7 of my vehicles are domestic.

As does my experience with Toyota P/Us and F150s. My only domestics are toys, extremely high HP hobbies and a new F350 diesel. If Toyo made anything comparable to the F350, I'd have been looking closely at that. If forced into a corner with no other choices but domestic, I'd probably opt for one of the Ford police units, about all that seems to be consistent. I consider where the profit goes to be the home of any marque.","political-stance-helps-country-more","01:16 PM","government-debates","172"

The Tundra is made in San Antonio, TX. The Ford F150's are made at several US locations. Interesting that your highest performance vehicles are domestic. Same here. Nobody in the world builds performance cars as well as the US dollar for dollar. To get a Honda to put out the same HP as my Z28, I could buy another whole Z28. They're eyeing the market as I write this. Toyota is a formidable competitor in any market they enter. They didn't get to be #2 without trying. F350 Super Duties are made in Kentucky. Toyota employs ~200,000 Americans, so I'd say a lot of Toyotas money enters the US' economy.","political-stance-helps-country-more","01:11 PM","government-debates","173"

Great engine and handling, but not much else. My brother-in-law's Benz SL was much faster and a real pleasure to drive, but out of my financial league. Given my druthers, Ferrari would of course be my first choice. Unfortunately for me, the one I want costs as much as a decent house. My toys are now all domestic old iron not regulated by emissions legislation used to pacify my HP addiction. That's transaction money, quickly diluted and dissolved by repeated taxation. OK for the little guy still pursuing his/her American Dream, but profits are the real money and they don't stay in the US as evidenced by our nightmare trade imbalance.","political-stance-helps-country-more","01:35 PM","government-debates","174"
"02-04-2005","1649",12,"Pendergast","None","Hi, am new here and am happy to be here. Anyway I feel that the right wants what is best for the country, because they want to lower taxs and I think that is a good thing. The left however wants from what I have heard anyway wants to rise mainly the rich peoples taxs(I am not rich by the way), and that is just redickulas what I think the left is missing is that they EARN that money, now some make the arugument that some people inharite that money and thats true but if they don't save that or invest it right, that money will be gone in a couple of months same goes for people who inharit companys if the don't run it properly it will ethier go bankurpt or they will lose control of that company. I will end by saying in my opioion atleast rich people shouldn't pay any more taxs then middle classed people or poor people.","bonddm","89808","I going to have to disagree with you. Left wing is more benficial to society in that they want an equilibrum and a balance of rights, and quality of living. The right wing on the other hand is only concerend with the wealthy getting richer.","political-stance-helps-country-more","02:55 PM","government-debates","175"

They think they can solve the problem of poverty by stealing everything from everyone. Sure, the leftists want greater rights for all, and that is a good thing. But their economic policy is nothing more than legitimized theft. I agree with you, though, in that the right wing is worse than the left wing. The right advocates societal tyranny AND legitimized theft. Under a right-wing government, we must pay taxes to the landlords, we must follow the ""moral"" way of life, and we must be careful to not commit heresy when we speak.","political-stance-helps-country-more","04:27 PM","government-debates","176"

You can't get that kind of power out of a lead sled. If I wanted something to do both, I'd save some money and get a better performer, a Z06 Corvette . Toyota has invested $12.8 Billion in US infrastructure and is investing a ton more in the next year of so. Their timeline for selling 2 million vehicles/year in NA by 2009 was already surpassed, so they're scrambling to increase US capacity.","political-stance-helps-country-more","06:41 PM","government-debates","177"
