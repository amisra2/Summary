"01-28-2005","1649",8,"georged","None","One looming factor about public services in the US is the current administration's coming effort to push many of those services from the federal level down to state and municipal levels. That will allow what they consider normal military expansion to continue in 2005-6 budgets. The problem there is that those programs will still have federal compliance legislation attached, with no funding. I live in a US state that has a constitution permitting no increase in public services or taxes without majority popular vote approval. Lawyers are now looking at how we'll cope with a potential increase in public service costs carrying federal legislation, which always uses federal highway and education funding as a bludgeon in coercing state compliance on all issues.","daewoo","88611","I live in Kansas, where we are constitutionally bound to a balanced budget. Alreayd lawmakers are trying to figure out ways around this without upsetting the population in general. The last couple of years, they have used the low interest rates as an excuse to issue bonds for projects that traditionally were paid out of pocket. Now we are in a situation where not only do we not expect to have nearly enoguh money, we are servicing a deabt load that is nearly 5 times that of 10 years ago. Things do not look good. It is business as usual on just about every level though, since it is widely assumed that we will have they will simply raise taxes to make up the shortfalls. It will be interesting to see what kind of reaction that raises from the general public. Kansas is a radically republican state, and we have a democratic goverener. She has been under a microscope since she took office, and failure to present a reasonable budget will likely be the end of her.","political-stance-helps-country-more","09:40 AM","government-debates","106"
"01-28-2005","1649",8,"Alan Ryan","None","I was struck by the healthy cynicism of your take on the wisdom of paying off the benefit seekers and unemployables rather than seeking to suppress them. A few years ago, I put a similar proposition before a group of pious social professionals at a seminar on ""workfare"": this caused a bogus outrage that resulted in some people almost censuring my very existence. Such a preferred remedy may meet the case while the ratio of those collecting benefit to those paying for it remains an economically viable number. But at least theoretically, unless the economy resumes its former prosperity, the tab will eventually become too big for the taxpayer to wink at any longer. One certainty we can count on is that no political party will grasp this nettle and readjust the situation so that genuinely needy people are assisted while the ""human right"" of freeloaders to live off the state is withdrawn. The $240-million-a-year General Assistance Program intended mostly for single adults was eliminated, ending welfare checks for nearly 83,000 people. In the aftermath, Engler was widely viewed as a coldhearted bureaucrat who was more concerned with balancing budgets than with the pain and suffering of poor people. His popularity sank across the state, polls showed. As it turned out, Michigan was on the vanguard of a national movement to change welfare, putting more focus on work. By the time Engler sought re-election in 1994, none of the three Democrats seeking the nomination proposed a return to the General Assistance Program. http://www.freep.com/news/mich/gov16_20020116.htm","JPSartre12","88616","All is not lost, IMO. When John Engler(R), governor of Michigan, cut the state's welfare role by 250,000 the roar from liberals was almost deafening, but with a Republican Statehouse behind him, he succeeded and even the Democrats in Michigan had to admit that ""tough love"" works. I think that for us to break the dependency on the Federal gov't, we need Washington to wean itself off of Federal social engineering programs. At first, send them back to the states with a concommittant reduction in the state's Federal tax burden. Then, let the states decide which programs it wants to keep...and more importantly, fund locally. With time, I think that you'd see a curious phenemonon take place. Indigents will ""shop states"" to find the best free benefits initially until the population of that state wises up and quickly moves to become more ""heartless"". I'm guessing that in 10 years, California would be transformed from the land of liberal fruits and nuts to the land of heartless Capitalists as California voters tire from the huge influx of street urchins from across the country seeking ""liberal freebies.""","political-stance-helps-country-more","09:56 AM","government-debates","107"

Chase county is the typical central kansas dying agricultural community, with one exception. They have incresed in size at a fairly alarming rate. Apparently wlefare in Chase county is higher than in other parts of the state because chase county is the poorest county in the state and has the highest number of ""disadvantaged"" people per capita (in fact the leeches outnumber the productive folks). People end up in chase county not only from otehr parts of the state, but from oklahoma as well, sinc ekansas pays better than oklahoma, and if you are goin gto move for a paycheck, you may as well maximise the benifit. Not a chance. Just looking over the new GDP numbers. 3.1% growth. Subtract from that deficit and debt service, and you are looking at negative growth. If you want to really scare yourself, there is an awful lot more you can subtract from it to get a better idea of the US economy (military spedning comes to mind). Currently, we have supposedly conservaitve republicans bowing down in worship of a president who passed the biggest social program in recent history. Waiting for true conservatives to come along is not likely an option.","political-stance-helps-country-more","10:38 AM","government-debates","110"

I am showing some uncharacteristic faith in politicians to stick to what is right and proper, not just what they can get away with. I realize it is probably wishful thinking. If our lawmakers do go that route, it spells certain disaster. We cannot afford to service the debt that we have already incurred, much less the addition of any new. Within 2 years, we would have to issue bonds just to make interest payments.","political-stance-helps-country-more","10:42 AM","government-debates","111"
