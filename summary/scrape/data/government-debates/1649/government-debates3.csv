"05-01-2004","1649",3,"Eddie","None","I wouldn`t bet on it. Firstly, why would he? I mean, it is apparant that there where many who had faith in the nazi ideology at the time. Why would Hitler be different from all of those with ""true"" faith? Secondly, Hitler also went out of his way to achieve certain objectives without any apparant gain other than fullfilling his ideological goals. The fact that the holocaust was a secret before the end of the war ought to disaprove the notion that his actions where based on some power maximizing strategy. Thirdly, after having read Mein Kampf (My struggle) I find it very hard to believe that someone would actually write that **** without believing it himself...","pyromattiac","47140","I didn't say he didn't believe in it, I said ""Hitler didn't necessarily have to believe"" I don't know what ""power maximizing"" strategy you are talking about, but it seemed more like a ploy to rally the people and turn the hard times into violent times (not difficult to do) but first he would have to rally the people against a common ""enemy"". He had to choose someone, and it just so happened that most of the Jewish community was richer than the rest of the country and that, most important of all, they looked different. If you think that looks don't matter, focus on what happened in America. We imprisoned all of the Japanese. Not the people of German descent, why? Simply because it was difficult to pick people of German descent out from people that descended from other European countries.","political-stance-helps-country-more","09:09 PM","government-debates","31"

He sure had some impressive strategies for rallying people. And he outlined them in Mein Kampf (My struggle), but racial purity or reclamation of the racial mastery of the german race was not a mean, it was the end. Of course looks matter. But nazi anti-semitism was not based on looks. It was based on a false notion about racial hierarchies, racial interests and racial struggle.","political-stance-helps-country-more","05:49 AM","government-debates","33"

Nazi germany imprisoned and murdered many germans that opposed the Nazi ideology. Marxists, social democrats, union leaders, intellectuals, liberals, anarchists, church officials etc where all systematicly harrased, imprisoned and even murdered. Acording to Nazi ideology there are many ""agents"" of the jewish race (most noteably, marxists). These agents may be of any race and are often ""race traitors"". these so-called ""race traitors"" where rounded up and killed as well, just as gypsies, jews or slavs... The holocaust was not commited to serve a practical purpose (sway the masses) but where done entirely for ideological reasons.","political-stance-helps-country-more","06:11 AM","government-debates","38"

"09-26-2004","1649",3,"None","None","None","Dzeron","68589","I believe that when a country swings from liberal to conserative, at least with regards to economics, the economy becomes more meritocratic. The liberals destroy the aristocratic ruling class, and afterwards the conservatives open the door for meritocrats (i.e. entrepreneurs, inventors, etc.) to rise in wealth. If this is done in the most radical form, that is, if a country swings from egalitarianism to laissez-faire capitalism, it will have a meritocratic economy that will remain meritocratic if inheritance is abolished.","political-stance-helps-country-more","08:35 PM","government-debates","40"

Centrism and pragmatism will always win in the end. Another thing for anyone reading this thread, especially if you are not from the US, or even if you are. Please do not equate Republicans with conservativism and Democrats with liberalism. It's not nearly that clear cut. While the general population of Republicans calls themselves conservative, a lot of their positions are not. While the general population of Democrats are called liberal, a lot of their positions are not. And, a lot of Democrats are called ""conservative dems"" or ""centrist."" It's funny, we have two ruling parties, with no real competition in sight. One is ~85% conservative, the other is about 40-50% conservative. It looks like the US is quite a conservative nation. (Someone else already said that con/lib in one country may be the opposite in another country.)","political-stance-helps-country-more","07:04 PM","government-debates","41"

"01-17-2005","1649",3,"None","None","None","zachvac","87138","Pretty much both parties seem to want the government to protect their rights but not others. The Democrats want the right to be free from guns but will take away others' ability to own a gun. The Republicans want the right to not hear or see gays get married and are willing to compromise their right to get married. And on taxes, someone mentioned that obviously low taxes were better. This is wrong. The library near my house had to close on Wednesdays and Fridays because it didn't have enough money to support keeping it open the whole week. But on the other side of that, someone mentioned that it would be bad for everyone to pay the same amount of money, but that's why we do percentages. Why do rich people have to pay a higher PERCENTAGE? Paying the same percentage of your income already scales it so rich people pay more yet Democrats want rich people to pay more taxes despite the fact that rich people already pay a disproportional amount of the money anyway. And the other thing. Before the debate on why Hitler did what he did... Hitler is irrelevant. He didn't try to bring everyone together so they were all the same race. He just created one race and killed the rest. I oppose affirmative action and totally agree that Dr. King fought for racial equality so that the government didn't view people by color, but as if we were all the same race. The government shouldn't recognize people by color, this is a violation of the 14th amendment. Hitler separated the races and killed the other races, what should be now is we are all brought together into one race, human beings.","political-stance-helps-country-more","12:36 PM","government-debates","43"

You're going to see a lot more of that as the federal government pushes former federal expenditures down to local levels, unfortunately complete with federal compliance legislation, in their effort to fund our gigantic military expenditures. Raising taxes puts politicians out of office, what was formerly a natural method of change without letting them get so deeply entrenched they assumed control of the populace, instead of the other way around. They (politicians) learned to use public debt to avoid raising taxes and losing their power. The rich will accept a certain level of wealth redistribution as long as it maintains social order. That's the price to keep the have-nots and their often bad habits of not following right and wrong as determined by criminal law and killing others in the process geographically separated from those who earn their money and make those lopsided social contributions. We're currently experiencing an era where the rich aren't satisfied with the somewhat chaotic justice system and government plundering, so they're using their power to cut back on their taxes by sending investment capital outside the US and reducing capital gains tax on existing investments.","political-stance-helps-country-more","05:50 PM","government-debates","44"
"01-18-2005","1649",3,"None","None","None","Dzeron","87375","I've been thinking, and I've realized that both liberals and conservatives are bent on keeping us poor. Liberals want to tax the bejeezus out of us and induce poverty directly. Conservatives want to have ""capitalism,"" and simultaneously close off all ""immoral"" exits from poverty (like gambling or growing pot) so the only way anyone can get any money is by working in the rich guy's factory. Populists combine the worst of both worlds.","political-stance-helps-country-more","09:26 PM","government-debates","45"
