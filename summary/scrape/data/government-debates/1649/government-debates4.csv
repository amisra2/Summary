"01-18-2005","1649",4,"Dzeron","None","I've been thinking, and I've realized that both liberals and conservatives are bent on keeping us poor. Liberals want to tax the bejeezus out of us and induce poverty directly. Conservatives want to have ""capitalism,"" and simultaneously close off all ""immoral"" exits from poverty (like gambling or growing pot) so the only way anyone can get any money is by working in the rich guy's factory. Populists combine the worst of both worlds.","daewoo","87387","Welcome to the libertarian party.","political-stance-helps-country-more","10:51 PM","government-debates","46"

I doubt he has a problem with people simply owning land. I, for one, think that there is land that should be privately owned and some that shouldn't. The problem arises in deciding what's what. Who decides? But sitting around bickering about who gets to ""own"" a wildlife refuge or not is better to me than selling it and having the ""owner"" ruin it for the inhabitants, the wildlife.","political-stance-helps-country-more","05:42 PM","government-debates","49"

In lieu of ownership, occupancy would be allowed if a product was produced on the land or as domicile, but with no resale or inheritance provisions. I was just being my usual capitalist pig self who enjoys land ownership and thought a try at ownership might turn theory to actuality, one way ot the other, through experience. I wonder how much pristine land in England will now be developed with the end of fox hunting?","political-stance-helps-country-more","07:14 PM","government-debates","50"

I think it's just as ridiculous as sky ownership. The sky is common property in our society, and I think the same should apply to land. The whole point of property rights is to ensure that we can own what we make. Land ownership is a form of ""power ownership"" whereby the rich can buy power to regulate things (in this case, the use of land.) I think it's the taint of a hypothetical economic system I call the ""power market,"" a system where people do not trade in things, but the power to regulate a command economy.","political-stance-helps-country-more","07:37 PM","government-debates","51"

"01-21-2005","1649",4,"None","None","None","pnac=ww3","87793","Ah, I see now. I didn't realize that Dzeron felt that way. It does seem silly to own land, but it's necessary. Maybe one day when we can have floating buildings and structures, people will want to own the sky, but for now all of these things are land based. I really don't see how much could get done in this country if people weren't allowed to own land in some form or fashion.","political-stance-helps-country-more","06:11 PM","government-debates","53"

"01-22-2005","1649",4,"splinter99","None","do you think a left wing party, such as Labour or the Democrats, are more aware of their countries needs, or vice versa? I personally think a right wing govt. because they are more nationalistic than left wingers and tend to spend more on the countries needs.","AMD4EVER","87846","I think the right wing does more for the country, however the left wing does more for the people. If you want to live in more of a utopian society, perhaps it is possible to at least take a few steps towards that by redistributing wealth and changing our focus from hard work to finding happiness in our life. The poor will no longer be hungry and will have a nicer place to stay, the rich will not work their lives away and spend more time with their families, and everyone in between should receive a little of both. If you want a country that will always be strong and always be leading the way in technology and economics then you will want the right wing perspective. People don't come second in this outlook I don't believe, but their overall importance does drop while the economic aspects increase. This is not a bad thing for all people either. The potential for a better standard of living exists in this view although I believe it is rarely achieved because people have to spend so much time and effort working towards it and when they reach it, they don't even know how to relax and enjoy it. I like the fact that in this country we have people who are fighting on both sides of this. If one side were to demolish the other I don't think it would be for the better. Its just like the competitive side of capitalism, both sides continue to find ways to improve life for the average person while looking out for our country rather than just imposing whatever will they wish on us. But if I had to decide on just one, I would probably pick the right wing outlook. I'd rather know that we're working to advance the human race and our own culture than just focus on enjoying the here and now.","political-stance-helps-country-more","10:14 AM","government-debates","55"

There are few traditional conservatives in today's society, but many liberals and libertarians who claim conservative views in attempts to gain greater access to public and private funds. Other than the entertainment industry, I've met few true liberals who didn't desire enjoying a better standard of living using redistribution of public and private wealth.","political-stance-helps-country-more","09:39 PM","government-debates","57"

In fact, it worked much better than the current system. In this day and age, people expect the government to handle charitable functions. Instead of a number of relatively small, efficient charities taking care of the poor, we have a massive government bureaucracy doing it. Instead of churches helping people out, generally using entirely volunteer labor, we have the government blowing in excess of 80% of the money that is earmarked for poor people on administration costs. Even today, there are certain groups that have opted out of expecting the government to care for their members, and they are better for it. The Mormons come to mind,","political-stance-helps-country-more","02:33 AM","government-debates","58"
"01-24-2005","1649",4,"Tigerlilly","None","I would rather have the government do it with taxation and reform than private endeavours. Libertarians think privatizing everything is the answer to every problem, when it's not. It's running back to the 18th century, which wasn't all that good for the majority of common people.","georged","88123","By their very nature government entities are proven to be the most wasteful, inefficient method to accomplish anything. With most everything in a democracy controlled by wealth, what leads you to think charity taxation would be sponsored by those who dictate legislation in a manner where it would exceed private contributions, which offer limited tax benefits to small givers and large tax benefits to major contributors? Where should common people be, on a standard of living equal to those with wealth? Even science fiction utopias have class distinctions.","political-stance-helps-country-more","05:33 PM","government-debates","60"
