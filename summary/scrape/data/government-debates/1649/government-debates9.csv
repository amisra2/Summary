I believe there are pending lawsuits on that issue as federal compliance has already put many state education budgets way in the red. Non-compliance means reduction of basic federal education grants, the ones based on numerical attendance, a big piece of money. If the feds decide they'll let states sue them. Supposedly, you can't sue yourself. Legally, though I'm not a lawyer, the feds can determine program scope on anything and use their best estimates of what federal compliance will cost. States eat the rest. Medical care will be simple as most states already have legislation in place where no person can be denied medical care. Aid to dependent mothers and housing allowances will also be pretty simple, the fed will just reduce other revenue sharing to accomplish what they want. As a fall back, fuel tax allocation is always the big club, allocation being by congressional committee and people do like their highways maintained.

"01-28-2005","1649",9,"Tigerlilly","None","10 million destitute people is a major problem--a problem not dealt with my Libertarian 19th century scrougeism. OH wait...it was more like 40%, not 12. WOw. libertarianian ""hands"" off poverty really does wonders. Private charities did very little for the poor and the massive poverty realistically began to subside after the age of mass society, which was after socialism and the libertarian model began to disintegrate. Although Americans have long celebrated their nation's wealth and the abundance of its resources, poverty has been omnipresent in American history. From the colonial period to the present day, large numbers of Americans have been poor: they have lacked the resources to feed, clothe, and shelter themselves adequately according to socially defined standards. Just how many Americans have lived in poverty over the course of more than three centuries is impossible to gauge; not only are data scarce, but the definition of poverty has changed too often (and is too subject to debate) to permit precise measurement. Nonetheless, there can be no doubt that poverty, as a personal condition and as a social problem, has long been a prominent feature of the economic and social landscape. Ahhhh, poverty declines dramatically...in the era of socialism at last. In much of europe, the problem was even worse","daewoo","88719","The education debate was between you and somebody else, so I will leave that to them. You are at least trying to refute now, which is a step forward. Is all of this from the same book? Is this really the kind of garbage they are basing education on these days? Lets take a look at this one for a second-- Can't measure it, can't even define it, no proof at all that it existed, but by god, it was obviously a problem. The bolded part above is all the ""fact"" offered here. Once you statr with ""well, we don't really have any data, or even a good definition...."" everything past that is pure speculation on the part of the author. Jesus, no wonder this country is in trouble. And again, you have failed to prove, or even provide any kind of thought provoking argument, that it existed at all. Your source here starts by stating that they have no data or measurement on the topic, even going so far as to say that the data does not exist. Lets go back for a second and examine my original argument, so you know what you are trying to refute (I honestly had to go back and look myself). I contended that----- 1-Government programs are by their very nature inefficient. 2-The economic situation in 17th-19th century America was not one conducive to wide spread poverty. 3-Data regarding poverty during the period is virtually non existant, which I contend is because it was not enough of a problem to bother keeping it. Now, you have effectively proven #3 is true. This is fine with me, though in the future, you may want to try to prove/push your own points, as oppossed to proving those of the opposition. I can argue my own points, I don't need any help. you have effectively done what the author of the referenced work did. You have formed an opinion despite the fact that there is no factual basis for it. You need to learn to think more critically, not just beleive whatever garbage happens to be in whatever textbook is popular at the time.","political-stance-helps-country-more","06:22 PM","government-debates","132"
"01-30-2005","1649",9,"Tigerlilly","None","It's not just that source. It's corroborated by other books and peer reviewed journals. It's highly unlikely they just make it up. It's not my job to find out how they get the information, only that it's part of a legitimate academic source. Being part of a college curriculum means it's highly likely that it's accurate and worth something. Despite the currently popular view that poverty was widespread in America from colonial times to the early 20th century, no evidence has been found to corroborate this. The majority of material suggesting this to be the case focuses on large port cities such as New York, Boston and Sacramento without taking into account the fact that the poverty levels in such cities was driven almost entirely by millions of new immigrants arriving every year from Europe primarily for the purpose of escaping poverty. Besides being illogical to believe that millions of emigrants seeking to escape poverty chose as their destination a country with a high poverty level, charitable records from the time do not support this viewpoint. The only extensive records from the period which address the issue are the records from charitable organizations. In analyzing the records from the 100 largest organizations, it becomes apparent that while the poverty level in New York and Boston may well have approached 25%, the poverty level in the united states as a whole was less than 2% Source was provided from an academic unit. That's enough, since it say sthe opposite, and textbooks in colleges as well as the journals on their databases are selected and reviewed. 1. I agreed with you on one, and I still do. 2. THe second one I am correct, since all historical sources say the same, and I am only required to provide those sources. I could care less how they come to that conclusion. I am not the curriculm. 2 is contrary to mainstream history, therefore I don't buy into it, and neither ought you. 3. Apparently they have information, since this isn't the only source which states the massive problem. It's also in the New International, Spielvogel's text, as well as Zinn's text. That's three academic college sources. I'm not going to disagree with them over the opinion of some guy on a webboard. They are good enough for Universities and the lecturers, they are good enough for me In regards to the first point about proving #3, I don't mind providing you with information when I have the chance. However, I use historical resources that are credible and widely used. I do want the information available to come out, regardless of who's it is. It would be dishonest otherwise, don't you think? Secondly, you didn't argue your points about the 18th and 19th centuries, since you have no records of the time, as you admit, because ""census"" date of the time wasn't ""kept on it,"" as you say. This means it could or could not have been a problem, regardless of their lack of keeping a good record, if that were the case. Historical texts/journals disagree with you, so they most likley have another way of finding the information required. I provided the sources. You don't have to agree with the source, but that doesn't make your case. My job is done; I provided a source which countered your lack of any resources on the topic, despite the burden of proof belonging to you. All texts say the same thing, and most credible historians agree, therefore I am not going to disagree with them. It's unlikely they are wrong. That's critical enough. You must have a problem with History sources. 1. The article describes data as scarce, but not non-existent. They obviously got them from somewhere else. Statistics aren't the only historical methods used. It's nOt my job in this discussion to find out where and to criticise mainstream historical sources. If there were a problem, the myriad researchers would have found it. This is like those people comming up with counters to evolution that they think are unique, as if the researchers of mainstream had not already taken care of that problem. THat's beyond the credible provided academic sources. I'll trust my peer reviewed journals and texts. Impossible is largely hyperbole, since it's not impossible due to the fact that they have rounded numbers, personal accounts of the period, primary documents, and collected, but scarce data from the periods. An inquiry into the cause of industrial depressions and of the increase of want with increase of wealth... The Remedy by Henry George Quote: Not everyone shared in the economic prosperity of this period. Many workers were typically unemployed at least part of the year, and their wages were relatively low when they did work. This situation led many workers to support and join labor unions. Meanwhile, farmers also faced hard times as technology and increasing production led to more competition and falling prices for farm products. Hard times on farms led many young people to move to the city in search of better job opportunities In the 19th century no special concern existed over children or women doing hard work; they had always worked within the family on farms, etc. By 1890 18% of the labor force consisted of children between the ages of 10 and 15. A state of quasi slavery existed where parents bound children to working; child labor was not really addressed until the Progressive Era. Quote: Industrial safety was a large issue: factory work was very dangerous, and it was difficult if not impossible to hold factory owners responsible for deaths and injuries. Around 1900 25-35,000 deaths and 1 million injuries per year occurred on industrial jobsmany of them railroad jobs, which were very dangerous. Fires, machine accidents, wrecks, etc. were common There was no federal regulation of safety and no enforcement of safety regulations.. Insurance and pensions were rare The cost of living during the pre-socialist years was three times as high as the wages paid to the masse who made up 80% of the population. In the 1850s the cost of living rose 12%, wages only 4%. http://www.nv.cc.va.us/home/nvsageh/...WorkingMen.htm Personal accounts and primary sources of poverty wide-spread among the working and lower middle class. In the fifteen years I have worked as a miner I have earned the average rate of wages any of us coal heavers get. To-day I am little better off than when I started to do for myself. I have $100 on hand; I am not in debt; I hope to be able to weather the strike without going hungry.","daewoo","88822","And yet in A New Economic View of American history: From Colonial Times to 1940 , Jeremy Atack Susan Lees and Peter Passell note: If you are interested in poverty in early America, the book is a must have. Their methodology in regards to the question of poverty is interesting. They obtained the records from charitable organizations and used those to study the issue. In reality, I think that their methodology may be a little skewed to the high side, though, since they assume that everybody who sought assistance, or whom the organization identified as being eligible for aid, lived in poverty. One of the organizations they used was The YMCA, including information from the Boston YMCA. The boston YMCA had, as one if its services, A free clinic that treated 73,363 new patients in 1891 and dispensed 85,752 prescriptions. These patients are included in the poverty roster. I think it is unreasonable to assume that everybody who shows up at a free clinic is necessarily living in poverty. They also included estimations from the catholic church regarding poverty (since the catholic church was the biggest charitable organization in the US during the specified period). The catholic church considered anybody in America who did not have at least 1 room for every two people in their home and 3 changes of clothing for everybody in the household to be living in poverty. While today this would certainly be considered poverty, I think they set the bar a little high for the time. It seems to me that they did this to increase the numbers (since, as Atack and Pasall note, poverty was fairly rare) in order to solicit larger donations. I remember being chastised by professors in college for not viewing things with a critiacl eye. Once in particular I was berated rather badly by an economics professor for simply repeating what I had read in a textbook. He said ""Mr Daewoo (nake changed to protect the innocent), does the text you just recited from give any numbers to support that statement, or explain the methodology they used to make the determination?"" ""no"" ""Does is provide any insight at all as to how the numbers were obtained, or any frame of reference as to how one might confirm those numbers?"" ""no"" ""Then how do you know that what you are reciting as fact is indeed fact?"" ""Well, it is in the textbook. Surely somebody has checked it."" ""Mr Daewoo, I wrote that textbook. What you just recited as fact was my personal opinion at the time, and I can assure you that nobody checked it for accuracy, as it has since been proven to be incorrect. You are not going to go far in this world if you do not learn to view things with a critical eye."" That was not an uncommon exchange when I was in college, so I admit that my view of what constitutues ""proof"" is slightly higer than ""Somebody wrote it in a textbook."" If it does not include methodology, raw data, or even an explanation of how the ""fact"" was arrived at, it is not ""proof"". What I posted above is ""proof"". It makes a statement, explains the basis for that statement, clearly identifies the authors, and gives anough information about source that you could (if you felt so disposed and had the time available) check the vlaidity of it yourself. The book explains the full methodology used to arrive at the conclusions they have regarding poverty in early America, including Giving alist of over 200 charitable organization, the record of which are the basis for their conclusion. THAT, is credible evidence. If you need, I can put up the whole list of organizations they used, or thier section on methodology. They actually concluded that only about half of those eleigible for applied or asked for aid, and included the prmise in their final calculation, which I think probably skews them more towards the high end. This is common in the academic world, it makes it easier to defend your work. A quote that starts with ""we don't have the data to support this, but here is what we think"" is no ""credible evidence"". What has happened to College? It used ot be you memorized facts in high school, then in college they taught you to think. Now it seems that you memorize fact in high school, and in college they teach you to think like everybody else. No wonder college grads and college students have taken on so many charachteristics of mindless drones. Then whay did you ask me to prove it? And I have refuted your sources. Beyond that, I have questioned the credibility of them. The fact that they are the textbook your classes use does not make them ""credible"". You now need to either defend your sources or, if they cannot be defended, find new ones. In order for a source to be credible, at the very least methodology and data sources must be explained. As you are still a student, I doubt you know a whole lot about ""mainstream history"", though I would imagine that you know a lot about the curriculem at your school. David Horowitz has written a lot of stuff, most of it better written and better documented than what you have provided here. A lot of what he writes is easily disproven garbage, though. Bellisiles and Finkleman have also written a lot of stuff, again, most of it (especially bellisiles work) is much closer to ""credible source"" than what you have posted here. His Gun study cites data and explains methodology. Of course, when you look at his data and methodology you quickly discover that he is a fraud, but at least he provided it. As an interesting side note, before being exposed as a fraud and subsequently dismissed from his postion in disgrace, he collaborated on several textbooks, some of which are already being used to indoctorinate a new generation of wide eyed Americna college student to (apparently) accept things unquestioningly. I suspect that in the next 5 years we will have to disprove his work all over again, since so much of it already made it into textbooks. Yet another intelectual inbred saying ""It is a fact because it is in my textbooks, and THAT is mainstream history"". This is why you must always think critically and never accept ""facts"" just because they are in print. If they are not independantly verifiable, or their basis is not explained, they are questrionable at best. There are others out there. Like Bellisiles, working from a faulty or even fraudulent basis, who are right now collaborating on new textbooks. As are the text books that Bellisiles collaborated on. Again, if no methodology is expalined, and no basis for the observation is explained, it is an opinion, not a fact, nor is it even a credible source. Besides, what you provided was opinions regarding #3, not #2. #2 focuses on the economic condition of the United states and whether or not it was conducive to poverty. This is not something you argue with regard to whether poverty existed, or whether poverty was a problem. It is strictly an economics question. What I am saying here is that generally economic conditions conducive to poverty include slow, flatline, or even negative economic growth, high levels of unemployment, low availability of industrial materials (raw materials for manufacture.....this requires that employers cut wages badly in order to cover the increased price of raw materials). I would even go so far as to include immigration numbers in this, since coutries that have a problem with poverty do not experience population growth due to immigration. Some do experience dometic population growth if there is a high level of infant mortality (since people have more children as theri odds of survival decrease), but immigration growth in nations with high rates of poverty is null. Since it is widely understood that American economic growth prior to the 20th century was phenomemnal, sometimes so large as to be damaging, and that this economic growth led to a job surplus, and that we saw a massive influx of emigrants during the time period, and that we had the cheapest raw materials on the planet at the time, would you like to just concede this point, and we can move forward to the question of how many people DID live in poverty, and the causes for that poverty? Still sounds an awful lot like you don't have any real data and are looking to use mine. It also sounds like maybe you are coming around, realising that ""historical resources"" which do not explain methodology, or even the most basic reasoning regarding their observations are questionable at best. Thre may be hope for the younger generation yet. I base my argument on the baove cited work, as well as a dozen or so other tomes I have on my shelf that use a similar methodology. Studying poverty in the early part of Americas history has always been problematic due to lack of data availibility. Susan Lee developed the concept of using charitable organizations record to estimate the scale of the poverty problem in early America. Since then, at least a dozen historians have adopted it to one degree or another. Since other records are either horribly incomplete or entirely non existant, and the records of charitable organizations from the time are the only complete records regarding poverty that we have from that time period, the idea caught on fairly well. While there is only limited data that can be gleaned from the records in question, it is nearly inarguably more credible than other guesses regrading poverty at the time, since we already know that other methodologies are basing their opinion son either incomplete data or no data at all. I have no problem with history sources, provided that they provide methodology and explain how they arrived at their conclusion. Otherwise it is just fluff, the opinion of the author. How many researcher do you really htink spend time checking the validity of textbooks? I know that one physics text used at MIT contains at least a half dozen glarign errors. It is common knowledge among students there. They have not ben corrected, though (since most text books are short run). Depending on how good your professor is, he MIGHT point out the errors. Some do not, though. I think this is kind of a test of who is actualyl a worthy pupil and who is not. If you don't catch the errors, and account for them, you almost certianly fail the course (since they are fundamental errors which increase in magnitude as the subject matter becomes more complex). Again, methodology, or at least basis for opinion, if you want it to be regarded as a credible source. This is why research still goes on. What revision is your text book on? I still have a coupel of text books on my shelf from the college days. On is a history text. It is on its 23rd revision. You really think that is because they were so right 23 times that they needed to update? If everything written about history in textbooks and journals was correct, there would be no research, since we already know everything (especially in regards to history, since it has already happened). If it makes you feel any better, I once held the same misconception as you about poverty in our nations history. It was not until I started studying economics that I stopped and went ""Hey, wait a minute, why would we have such high poverty in an economy like THAT. Even the bad years were better than anything we have seen in the last 50 years"". I was then that I started taking a serious look at the history materials I had read on the subject (at the time, I,lie you, was a wide eyed socio fascist with little or no understanding of how the world actually worked, and my views were based largely on the mainly liberal leanings of my soft science professors (literature, history, etc...). As you delve a little deeper into your sources, you will likey find that most of the opinions expressed are based on 3 main sources: 1-firsthand obswervations of the living conditions of the poor, but without taking into account that such firsthand observations invariably center on the worst conditions the author could find to describe 2-Limited data available from New York, Boston, and other port cities, but without taking into account the masisve number of poor emigrants who arriving daily (which really does beg the question, why were so many people coming ot America if it was indeed the land of squalid poverty?) 3- Pure conjecture on the part of the author. Those were the 3 identifible ""sources"" I found when I looked at the same question (that was the beginning of realization for me that an agenda was beig pushed, and not one based in intelligent thought). So, where did those rounded numbers come from? Vauge numbers ore often the result of no data, an idnicator that you are flying on faith. This has nothing to do with poverty. It says that small farms saw hard time (gee, really....) and that wages were relatively low. That is a no brainer as well. Small farmers are STILL having a rough time, and technology and increasing production are STILL driving the cost of farm goods down. That same technology also provided for greater output for the farms with less labor requirement. Today, children are still being driven off the farm and to the city to find jobs. In fact, this has increased. A family farm cannot justify keeping 4 kids around to do the work of one man. at one time, 80 acres was about all 2 men could handle. Now 80 acres is nothing. We have combines that cut a 25 ft swath and can effectively harvest at over 30 miles per hour. Here you are talking cultural differences between then and now. Prior to the technologialc farming revolution, kids stayed on their families farms for life, working along side dear old dad, and peopel knocked them out like it was going out of style due to lack of birth control and the need for labor on the farm During the early part of the 20th century, the leading cause of death in industrial accidents was boiler explosions. A boiler is an expensive piece of equipment. Do you really think that the factory owners were failing to maintain them in the safest manner possible (since a boiler explosion is about all that really happens with a boiler than kills people)? Metallurical advances led to better and safer boilers, which benifitted everybody. Technology made for a safer workplace. While I would certainly agree that government regulation has likely saved some lives, I think to give them too much credit is a farce. The provided data does not fit that statement. Here is the snippet you provided: That is a 12% INCREASE in the cost of living, and a 4% INCREASE in wages. That does not at all supprot the statement that the cost of living was 4 times as high as the wages provided, which is an idiotic and impossible statement. If you look at modern numbers that INCLUDE food and energy, which are generally excluded form COL calcualtions and inflationary calcualtions (I can only assume to keep from scaring the general public, since food and energy to heat your home when it is 2 degrees outside should certianly be considered part of the cost of living), we are doing worse today. Last year, real cost of living went up 8% and real wages went up less than 2%. If you include inflationary calcualtions (weakeneing dollar), the number is horrifying (the dolalr dropped 19% against other major currencies in 2003, and 15% in 2004) I am not sure why they don't include energy costs and food in these numbers, since they are certainly the basis of our economy. Even housing costs are not included in most COL calcualtions anymore (though they used to be). Again, I can only assume this is to keep the public complacent. Even juicy government COLA programs have not kept up with RCOL. This one can help you as well. As mentioned in an above article, prosperity is judged by those who experience the time. The wealthy upper class as well as the plutocracy thought wonders of the time, but the lower middle class, workers, and poor, did not, adn they made up the bulk of the population (75-80%). From the text: WOW, money on hand and NO DEBT. Considering the Average American has a NEGATIVE net worth today, most can only aspire to be as fortunate as this poor person. again, these are worthless as indicators of how wide spread poverty truly was, or what the average living condition for those in poverty are, since such accounts tend to focus on the most morbid conditions one could find in an attempt to highlight the point they are trying to convey. This is like looking at descriptions of the squalor of East St Louis and saying ""that is what America as a whole is like"". Read teh account of the chinese laundryman. He started out making $3.50 per week, but SAVED $3 of it, then got a raise to $5 per week, and SAVED $4.25. After 2 years of working a menial job, he had saved enoguh moeney to start a business. This is the kind of escape from pverty I was talking about, as well as a good example of why I think poverty was largely considered a temporary situation. In a strong, growing economy, anybody who is willing to work, and work hard, is able to get ahead. How long do you think you would have to work at Mc donalds today before you saved up enough cash to start your own business? I appreciate the latest effort to prove my points for me, but again, the idea here is for you to disprove my points, not prove them","political-stance-helps-country-more","10:11 AM","government-debates","134"
