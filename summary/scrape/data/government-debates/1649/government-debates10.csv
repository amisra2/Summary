"01-30-2005","1649",10,"georged","None","When undergrads are unable to quote documented US capitalistic history, forget world history, in argument to published, required textbook theoretical summaries favored by academia and our socialistic leaning government, mediocrity has taken over and that's generally succeeding batches of instructors who will perpetuate those desires. The goverment teat is hanging out there to supply all things seems to be the message.","daewoo","88830","This does seem to be a problem, especially when you have somebody here arguing the postive effects that socialism has had on our country and comletely missing the fact that our nations developed dominance, including a higher standard of living for its citizens, based almost entirely on anti-socialist principals despite the fact that we essentially started with a population the mojority of whihc started out as Europes poor and undesirables. I know that back in the old days, I would have failed any paper where I cited sources such as have been presented here as ""proof"". Sources lacking methodology, data, or basis for rational were at one time considered totally unacceptable in the academic world. I knew that our educational system, particularly at the college level, was largely liberal in their leanings, but never realised until I started debating with tigerlilly exactly how bad the problem had become. It is pretty sad when citing a source that is itself uncited passes for ""proof"" in teh academic world. It does explain the explosion in socialist and liberalist thinking, since both are primarily rooted in obscure idealistic reasoning as opposed to being logic driven based on available facts. If we are no longer using facts as the basis of our educationa and decision making processes, I suppose we will see more of the saem, until such thinking bankrupts the syatem (as factual and logical thinking tells us it invariably must).","political-stance-helps-country-more","11:54 AM","government-debates","136"

"01-30-2005","1649",10,"Tigerlilly","None","Well, the most common belief why many people came to america is because the poverty of europe was worse than America, but that doesn't mean that it was wonderful. The poverty problem was also hidden. Communication wasn't fast or reliable for many people, and America was propagandized as the land of opportunity where you could use social stratification to your advantage. I support SOME socialist programs, because not all are bad. I want to keep min wage laws, factory laws. I want limited aid packages. THere's a difference between a wacko-socialist and a mild socialist. If you can fix the poverty problem: reALLY fix it, and not having millions have no healthcare, no adequate living conditions, that's fine. As it stands now, how many people don't have healthcare? Is it like 10 million children? Should the government do nothing? What will happen when you get rid of any type of welfare and charities cannot (and won't) magically fill the void? Are people going to die? Even if the economy is running efficienty, which Libertarianism tries to do, there will be hundreds of thousands of people who will regardlessly live in poverty. It's not human nature to change and become productive if they aren't. Humans are inherently lazy as a species. I don't think politicians should pork barrel either, but I am for programs that alleviate suffering. I don't want wealth equalization or government domination of resources and capital. SO how do you say I am a fascist or Socialist? Are you a christian because you support (perhaps) some christian ideals? Some ideology does not a socialist make. So ridiculously low labour wages didn't contribute to the problem? How did they get higher wages? Not from Libertarianism, but from mild social policies and regulations. The farms really aren't the concern. It's the city dwellers. Farmers can be expected to decline. It's the wage and conditions of workers and middleclass. Really, we would be fortunate to not barely be able to get food? Most americans have a high standard of living today compared to that of the 19th century. It's considered that conditions in the cities that were selected aren't different from other urban cities. IT's doubtful they are. Oh i did read this. It's an exceptional story, but it doesn't reflect the majority. Entreprenurial ability is one of the 5 major scarce resources in Economics. Not everyone has this ability. If they don't, should they die and their families starve? He has a measly 100 dollars and hopes not to go hungry, which is a problem no one should have to deal with realisticially. YOu ought not have to worry if you are going to get your next meal or starve to death. YOu shouldn't have to have wages which are so low that you can barely feed your family. THe problem is now there are actual min. wage laws and wages are fairly good enough to survive for the majority of people. Then, they were not so lucky. If you do falter, there are also government programs that can help you. THen, you only had your local church or benevolent people to beg up. Now, the situation is getting worse as time goes on, yes. Poverty moves in shifts depending on certain policies and external influences. I never ment that the wages were 4 times lower. I miswrote that. What I meant was that the level of cost of living rose 4 x the ammount of the wages raising. It was bad then, and today's situation is bad too, but at least now wages are more in sync with costs, but that's changing. Back then, the wages were already already very low, as was the typical standard of acceptible living, especially for unskilled labour and low middleclass artisans etc.","daewoo","88884","Certainly not. You had to work for a living. So millions of people were completely duped by a marketing scam, in an age where there was no mass media? You could work hard and get ahead, which was little more than a pipe dream in the rest of the world. Only 11.4% of children did not have health insurance in 2003, according to the census bureau ( http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/hlthins/hlthins.html ). That is 8.4 million children, and over half of them are eligible for insurance but not enrolled. So....what....we provide health insurance for everybody at an inflated cost? I have a better idea, one that has actually not been shown historically to be an utter failure. How about if we cut those programs alltogether, lower taxes, and let people buy their own insurance? I am certianly not against all social programs. I have stated here before, in this very thread, that I am all for engouh social programs to keep the poor contained and compalcent enough to not riot. Beyond that, I don't think we should be prividing them anything. YES, some will die. Regardless of what you do, some will always die. It is inevitable. Always has been, always will be. To push for a 0 death rate is entirely unrealistic. We already have government domination of resources and capitol. It is not so much your economic views that make you a socialist or a fascist as much as your other views. you seem to be all for a state that is ""like a parent"", which is how the fascist state was described by Mussolini. Socialist prefer to call it ""big brother"". but the concept is the same. No, not really, especially since farm production is not tied to labor rates (in fact, if you look at economic reports ""non farm"" wages are a seperate calssification). They got higher wages due to increased labor demand. Barely be able to get food? On the same page there is an account by a chinese gentleman that claimed he made $3.50 a week and saved $3. This guy had $100 stacked away and no debt. That was likely 6 months pay. How many Americans do you think have 6 months pay in the bank and no debt? This guy was a miner, relatively unskilled labor, who had $100 at a time when $200 would buy you a farm with a house. How many unskilled laborers do you know to day that can make such a claim? So, authors are radically different today than they were back then? I mean, if you choose to write abotu poverty, you choose cases that best illustrate your point. Come on. The guy washed laundry by hand. YES, anybody can do that. If your premise was correct, why is it that even in 1900 the US had the higest standard of living in the world? If it was a question of entrepenurial ability (whihc I agree is rare), the majority of peopel would have been starving, which would likely have removed us from that particualr list alltogether. That is the point. In a healthy, growing economy, you do not have to posess incredible amounts of skill to get ahead, you simply have to be willing to show up and do your job. So, do you think he was worried about starvign becuase he was poor, or because he was a cola miner, which implies a remote location, and food simply became scarce in the winter due to the fact that game is harder to come by and winter transportation is unreliable at best, and the ability to store fresh produce was virtually non existant? Keep in mind that at the turn of the century a penny would get you 2 loaves of bread. Until recent years and the boom in professional welfare recipients, poverty has always been traced directly to economic factors. In a growing economy, wiht a low rate of unemployment, poverty was traditionally slight and temporary. With the social programs we have in place, poverty does not change much regardless of economic circumstance becuase there is no incintive for people to go to work./ In addition, massive socail programs have alwyas, without fail, in every situation where they have been tried, proved to be such a drain on the economy that it withered, causing more poverty. the wage was not ""very low"". There is this thing called ""inflation"". A dollar used to be a considerable sum of money. Pennies used to actually buy something. It is incredibly rare for cost of living to NOT rise faster than wages in the US. You will have about 25 years of incresaes in the cost of living without equal increses in the average wage, and then about a 5 yr cycle where the cost of living is heavily overshadowed by wage increases. It has always been this way. A 12% cost of living increase with a 4% wage increase is not remarkable or even bad.","political-stance-helps-country-more","08:13 PM","government-debates","143"
"01-30-2005","1649",10,"daewoo","None","Currently the ""mainstream"" says that we have a good, growing economy. I, having a calculator and knowing how to use it, did my own calculations and made a lot of money last year investing based on the premise of a failing economy. That is the difference between a fact based assesment and a non factual one. That is just sad, though it does explain the inability of most college grads to think outside the box, as well as explaining why those who can fetch a premium on the job market. It also explains why so many Americans live trapped int he lower and middle calss and never manage to break into a financial position beyond basic survival with few luxuries. You do not really get ahead thinking like everybody else.","georged","88885","Other than on a consulting basis I left the corporate world 15-years ago. At that time we were requiring a grad degree (not in internal or published HR data) from primarily private schools as the public schools had turned to MBA programs for revenue sources. They were churning out primarily liberal arts types who thought they'd make big money in business with a quick program by stuffing them with theory bearing little resemblance to the real world. Needless to say, most were absolutely lost when faced with making even feeble attempts to understand structured circumstances and how problems were remedied. Most of us understood at that time the rumors of deteriorating education were indeed a fact; former high school knowledge levels were being pushed up to the undergrad level. The ability of many people able to think on their feet was being reduced to those who were obviously capable, and they were becoming few and far between. We were receiving human robots full of programming errors as America attempted to force all students into believing a college education would be their salvation. Business could easily see the American gravy train slowing down, anyone who didn't understand it with Regan's tax cuts had to be a shining example of the Peter Principle. The politicians knew at the same time, and education became a great horse to ride. Federal student loans made it a very controllable situation, allowing the powerful federal bureacracy to make all rules. Let them learn by questionable rote makes numbers. They either pass or fail a bar set by whatever text books they use. At a certain point capacity became a problem. That's pretty easy to sort out, the fed began applying qualifiers on how applicants would be accepted. Equal rights based on every rationale from poverty to race was employed in a desperate effort to spend money, public funds, to divert what was eventually going to become a two tiered social system out of economic circumstances from reality. Now that an undergrad degree in anything is well on the way to becoming a requirement for fast food counter employment, most of America is adjusting to what will be a lower standard of living for many folks. So what's the political difference if they're kept occupied with what they're being told will be their intellectual and economic saving grace or telling them that they're not getting a useful education? They eventually inherit what's left. Hopefully, most have good trusts to fall back on.","political-stance-helps-country-more","08:43 PM","government-debates","144"
"01-30-2005","1649",10,"Alan Ryan","None","Quite a number of those young Marxists never outgrow their juvenile political enthusiasms. What's more, a significant fraction of them - now posing as a ""liberal intelligentsia"" - occupy influential positions in government, the media, universities, and the law. I would suggest that the misguided egalitarianism of this so-called liberal elite is responsible for the sentimental welfarism that is supposed to solve the problem of poverty. One of my sons has fairly high level job in the administration of the health service (he has adopted the world view of the ""liberal elite""): when I argue in this way with him, he accuses me of being a callous reactionary brute.","Dzeron","88886","I don't think Marxism or socialism are egalitarian philosophies.

I think we have all long been aware of the decline in the quality of education for a purely curriculum driven standpoint. When businesses started hiring college grads for positions that traditionally did not require one simply so they could insure that the applicant could read and perform arithmetic at an 8th grade level, that should have clued most into the declining standard as far as bulk of knowledge obtained goes. I was unaware that the definition of ""fact"" had changed from an academic standpoint from something that could be proven to merely something that has been written. It would appear from the recent conversation that the current crop of students is so well indoctrinated in the new order of things that they fail to grasp the circular logic involved. It is a fact because it is in the book, and we have proof that it is a fact because.........it is in the book. Somebody with a word processor and a linguistic gift could elevate themselves to the level of god. Froma purely practical standpoint, I suppose it doesn't matter what you tell them. It seems that the new educational system is certain to prove to be useful in the future, since it is likely to include massive poverty and a two tier socail system. Teaching them not to think, to shut up and believe what they are told to believe certainly has its benifits if you are the guy in charge of keeping the unwashed masses in the gutter where they belong. We may very well find that our modern system of higer education is neraly as useful as christianity for keeping the poor in their place.","political-stance-helps-country-more","10:33 PM","government-debates","146"

The short term, desired effect of generally poor quality of education, from the perspective of a callous capitalist, is to build a citizenry capable of accepting government direction without question. If textbook matter is controlled by federal funding including direct school grants and individual scholastic loans for 'higher' education, it becomes a matter of fact that education will be to prevailing government standards, always substandard due to political necessity, without regard to practical application. The long-term problem is having a populace unable to relate to anything but what is/was in their mediocre textbooks and unfounded personal esteem, being mentored by instructors with that same lack of personal responsibility. In a declining economy, and maybe someone else sees recovery to our former, superior level of prosperity but I don't, the government is going to end up caring for a large population devoid of common sense and practical skills. It'll take a generation for those unable to generate their own wealth to go through what meager assets they inherit from lower and middle-class parentage immersed in personal and public debt. At that point, which we're already beginning to see, we'll experience the wealthy, a new middle class of government employees, and the have-nots. With that number of people being supported by public funds, the only major issue becomes how long we can afford to support them when 50% of annual budget is being spent on military expenditures and crusades. We're cooking up one big mess.","political-stance-helps-country-more","09:18 AM","government-debates","150"
