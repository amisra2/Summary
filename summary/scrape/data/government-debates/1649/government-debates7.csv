What's more, a significant fraction of them - now posing as a ""liberal intelligentsia"" - occupy influential positions in government, the media, universities, and the law. I would suggest that the misguided egalitarianism of this so-called liberal elite is responsible for the sentimental welfarism that is supposed to solve the problem of poverty.

Prior to that there was little demand for US social professionals, most public funding being confined to state facilities and services. Our government's entry into subsidized living in the 1960s spawned a huge industry of public employees covering every mental and physical health discipline in the book and an even greater number of new ones. As federal social engineering programs grew, the staffs serving them increased in logarithmic fashion as 'treatment' methodology became fashionable. I can see where Marxist ideology would flourish in that atmosphere. I also view that US government social direction change as a beginning conditioning effect on the general populace, the government take care of everyone attitude that now seems so very common in the generation first exposed to it and progressively more so in succeeding generations. That also spawned the first crop of US politicans who started using public money as an incentive for votes from the cushioned sector.","political-stance-helps-country-more","02:48 PM","government-debates","94"

Business paid its share, easily passed on to end consumers, no government costs and one of the few plans other than military expenditures we've had as a nation that extended beyond 3-4 years. In original form, it would have eliminated future tax burdens on those who pay the bulk of personal taxes to carry the poor. And that exposure is now in the very near future. Then the politicians, we both know who, got into it in a serious manner and discovered they could pump almost anything not being paid out into general revenue to meet budget shortfalls and avoid the risk of not being reelected by raising other taxes. That meant they kept it as a big slush fund, with no public attention desired. To have properly maintained it would have meant actuary and contributory adjustments and pushing the retirement age out to 70, where it should have been years ago, but that would have meant closer scrutiny and public uproar.","political-stance-helps-country-more","06:02 PM","government-debates","96"

(A rare case in which America might be behind social policy in Europe ?) The number of people on the public payroll here in the UK is growing almost exponentially and ""stealth"" taxes have been increased to finance this huge bureaucracy. Incentives to get off welfare and back into employment are disappearing fast and even middle income families expect and get tax credits for shouldering responsibilities that are strictly private choices and which should be economically neutral. But once ""free"" welfare services are rolling, they are very difficult to stop. No political party has any credible plan to even modify the rate of increase. The only (feeble) hope I can conjure that might eventually stall the idiotic growth of welfare systems is that, in the end, people will revolt against inferior services and the state will be compelled to retreat.","political-stance-helps-country-more","04:33 AM","government-debates","99"

It has been a lot of years since there was any incentive to get off welfare here in the US. Most people who are currently on welfare never get off, and when their kids get old enough to collect (since they inevitably reproduce, we build benifits for reproduction into the system), they take their kids down and sign them up. The more kids you have, the more money you get, so we are effectively encouraging the dregs of society to reproduce at a disporportionatly high rate, thus ensuring that future generations will have even MORE layabouts to support. I can certainly understand the reluctance of any major political party to address the issue (that is the case here, too) since nothing motivates career welfare recipients to get out and vote like the suggestion that they might have to get a job. Personally, I have no problem with reasonable social programs. It is certainly cheaper and easier to pay off the lower end of society than it is to have to hold them back by force. When you are encouraging them to breed, and providing no incentive for them to improve their situation, it will not take long before there are more of them than the system can handle. The up side is that, as I pointed out earlier in the thread, economic circumstances are such in America that we will soon not have enough money to support those who, God bless them, just don't feel like working. Maybe as our european counterparts watch the wealthiest nation on the planet wither and die, they will learn something from the display. While massive social spending has certainly not been the main cause of the decline, it is certainly a major one.","political-stance-helps-country-more","05:39 AM","government-debates","100"

In the US free services permeate our society from college age through retirement, the entire span of voters. Modification of increase isn't even a consideration, expansion is what helps win elections. One looming factor about public services in the US is the current administration's coming effort to push many of those services from the federal level down to state and municipal levels. That will allow what they consider normal military expansion to continue in 2005-6 budgets. The problem there is that those programs will still have federal compliance legislation attached, with no funding. I live in a US state that has a constitution permitting no increase in public services or taxes without majority popular vote approval. Lawyers are now looking at how we'll cope with a potential increase in public service costs carrying federal legislation, which always uses federal highway and education funding as a bludgeon in coercing state compliance on all issues. And then there's Russia, with thousands of retired people demonstrating daily about reductions in their previously bare subsistence only pensions. Russia's attitude about what the public thinks hasn't changed much since being the czars, bullets always being less expensive and troublesome than civil disobedience.","political-stance-helps-country-more","09:01 AM","government-debates","101"

The success of this kind of manipulation (which is so regular as to be quite unremarkable here) depends of course on the apathy/ignorance of the ""voter in the street"". Nobody is supposed to notice what's going on.

Keep the unwashed masses in the gutter where they belong with enough to keep from starving to death and (more importantly) from rioting. The system has, as I think you are implying, broken down. No longer are we giving folks the minimum amount needed to keep them complacent. Now we have bred a whole generation of human leeches whose entire existence is Dependant on the legislated charitable contributions of those members of society who are actually productive. The problem is that we have raised the bar as far as what is expected to keep them complacent. No longer is just a roof over their head and enough food to keep them alive acceptable. Now welfare recipients it he US expect enough cash to be able to purchase and maintain a nice car, have a nice entertainment system, etc... These things are no longer considered luxuries, but the right of every American welfare recipient. It won't be long before we cannot afford to keep people at this level, and when we fail to do so, electrified fences, attack dogs, roving patrol, and belt fed machine guns may very well start looking more affordable. I would agree that government programs to help the truly needy is a noble cause. The problem seems to be that governments can not seem to differentiate between ""truly needy"" and ""human leech"".","political-stance-helps-country-more","09:31 AM","government-debates","105"
