"01-25-2005","1649",5,"Tigerlilly","None","Show it worked well. THe situation for many people wasn't good relying on charity. THe population was also much smaller and events were much different through most of American History. Prove it worked better. Prove people were happier and better off. I am not going to trust anything to charaties. They are unreliable and sporadic. You are trusting in pity parties. People will willingly give up enough money to help everyone else. That's neither human nature nor efficient. I would rather have the government do it with taxation and reform than private endeavours. Libertarians think privatizing everything is the answer to every problem, when it's not. It's running back to the 18th century, which wasn't all that good for the majority of common people.","daewoo","88160","The poor probably weren't happier. Under such a sytem of voluntary charity, there is no such thing as a professional welfare recipient. Traditionally, private charities have been known to give a hand up, not a hand out. If you look at the difference in placement in private housing programs as opposed to public housing programs (not to mention the quality of housing provided), private job services as opposed to public job services, etc... It becomes almost immeditly (and painfully) obvious that despite the fact that government funding for such programs severely overshadows private funding (we are talking several orders of magnitude), the private programs actually place more people in homes, and put more people in jobs, than the government programs. Until after the new deal, poverty numbers in this country were not routinely kept. Poverty was considered a temporary situation. You fell on hard times, you went to a church (nearly every church had a indigent fund to help you out), or to the salvation army, or goodwill, and they would help you out with paying your bills and keeping your family fed until you could find a new job or get something going as far as putting some money in your pocket. But it has always worked. You can argue all you want that it is sporadic or inefficient, but the longest running charitable program in the world has been running out of the basement of a church in boston since 1802. Even if people cannot be fully expected to give out money from the goodness of their hearts, they can certainly be expected to do it for the tax break. Of course you would. you prefer a nanny state. I just thank god that there are millions of Americans out there oiling their bolt carriers just waiting for the chance to shoot those who think along the same lines as you should your type ever actually gain enough power to make a significant difference. Not that it really matters. By giving people a choice of whether to work for a lower wage, or stay home and not work and collect welfare (which in many cases pays better than entry level positions), the libs have effectively destroyed the manufaturing base in this country. It does not matter one iota what you ""prefer"". Cash is running out of here at the rate of a trillion + per year, JUST in trade deficit (not even going to touch on things like debt service, foreign aid, etc...). It will not be long before there is not enough money left in the country to finance social programs anyway. This is the problem with your concept here. As warm and fuzzy as it may make you feel to think you are helping out the poor, the idea you are pushing has never worked before, and it does not seem likely it will work in the future. While it certainly helps out some people in the short term, it has always proved ruinous to your ecenomy in the end. Evne coutnries where such systems are apparently working, such as sweden, have some pretty serious problems once you peel back the feel good rhetoric.","political-stance-helps-country-more","01:45 AM","government-debates","62"
"01-25-2005","1649",5,"Tigerlilly","None","Of course eveyrone shouldn't be the same class. I never said that. Society has a duty to make sure everyone (or at least as many people as possible) has at least a basic standard of living and education to preserve social Utility. We must make sure that everyone has a net of safety if they really choose to work and contribute to society. The poor shouldn't be on an equal standard of living to the wealthy, but from a Utilitarian POV, and according to Rawlsian justice, you ought to have them have equal opportunity to offices and programs. Everyone should have at least an equal basic foundation provided. I don't believe charaties can provide for these goals on the scale required. They haven't done that well in the past, and the populations have only gotten larger and needs have gotten greater. It's basically relying on people's good will to help others, which as we see in Communism--is relatively non-existent. I don't donate to charity, and I probably never would unless I am required to. Millions are like this, and that's why charity doesn't work. I wouldn't pay taxes to go to education if I weren't made to either. People are inherently greedy and lazy and they need to be forced to do what's in the greater interest of society. I would like to see an education plan funded largely through charity. I would like to see a successful welfare system based on charity. It won't. As a famous Literary Libertarian once stated"" are there no prisons? No work camps? No shelters? The Libertarian party focues too much on investment and personal freedom, not enough on collective good, beneficience, and duty. It's the Eboneezer Scruge party.","georged","88174","I find it difficult to comprehend any society other than pure communism providing an equal foundation of basic living to all citizens without extreme birth control measures. And that eliminates class distinctions. The US is trying that without birth control through various social programs that have for the most part failed, merely expanding the poor base through succeeding generations. As I recall, we're now up to 8th generation welfare recipients and running out of money. Using aid to dependent mothers, food stamps, housing allowances and general welfare payments, we've basically grown our slums at a predictable rate. Prior to the great depression starting in 1929, when the US was still primarily a rural society, midwifes often arbitrarily made the decision of whether or not newborn children were physically capable of entering society in a contributing manner or if affordable. While I'm not suggesting such draconian measures as a solution to our current problems, some method of birth control will be required to successfully maintain any social program caring for those who are unable or unwilling to care for themselves. If you want graphic examples of what a complete lack of birth control can achieve without fiscal capability to care for it, go to most large Mexican or S. American cities (and other nations, but I've seen these) where huge bands of children, homeless and members of families that can't feed them, roam garbage and waste dumps like talking rats to eat and clothe themselves. Catholicism, pro-birth and no money at work within contemporary society.","political-stance-helps-country-more","09:49 AM","government-debates","63"

"01-25-2005","1649",5,"Tigerlilly","None","And few people actually care about others. It's not a very compassionate society. THe 18th century, for anyone who wasn't rich or high middle class, sucked. What's the source that states that charties give people more homes than does government help? What's the source for Jobs vs Government job placement programs? THere was always a census. But provide a source stating this. Yes, and the idea of only temporary poverty is nonsensical. Today, it's not forseeable that society can rely on charity if it can't rely on the taxation of millions of people.","daewoo","88246","Not in America it didn't, becuse there were plenty of exits from poverty available and every church in the country (which at the time was more or less insanely religous) operated outreach type programs. It seems your definition of ""sucked"" is ""you could not just feed off the public teat for your entire life"". If that is the case, you are entirely correct. BUT, at the same time, you actually had a chance to do something with your life. Department of housing and urban development issues a quarterly report re:housing placement and availability. Labor department keeps data on government job placement programs. For private programs you have to ""go to the source"". The problem with your plan is the waste inherent to any government program. With 80% of total revenue going to cover administrative costs being considered acceptable, and 50% being considered fairly high for a government program, only a relatively small fraction of the total money ""donated"" through taxation actually provides any benifit to the poor. Local privet charities, though (which I differetiate from large national charities because most f the large national charities have number no better, and often worse, than their government counterparts), have a flowthrough of nearly 80%, and in many cases 100%, since they often rely on volunteer labor and donated facilities. Try to find the numbers. Go ahead. They simply are not out available. If the taxation in question actually resulted in the majority of those funds ending up assisting the poor, there wouldn't be a problem. Again, you fail to address the inefficiency inherent to government programs. That seems to be the achilles heel of you entire thought process. It is why socialist societies inevitably fail. We spenmd huge amounts of money for relatively small gains, at the same time stifiling industry and depriving them of low cost labor, which decreases opportunities to exit from poverty. As long as you are runnign a job surplus and your economy is growing, poverty can be written off as a temporary. At the end of the day, we have tried both ways. Mine worked. Yours didn't. Not only did yours not work, it has led to the breeding of a sub class of people.....professional welfare recipients. Today, a child raised on welfare is almost certain to end up a long time welfare recipient themselves. And why not? That is how they were raised, how they learned the system works. You sit at home all day and once a week get your welfare check and get money put into your vision card account.","political-stance-helps-country-more","09:30 PM","government-debates","69"

That's a built-in escape clause from personal responsibility rationalized by compassion. Our current experience with government charity, because it was easier than facing difficult social issues during our long run of prosperity, has proven that all we've done is create a new class of people. As prosperity continues to diminish and our tax base declines, those government responsibilities are being pushed down to state and municipal levels complete with federal compliance requirements. While potentially a very effective form of wealth redistribution, I can assure you that all it will eventually do is create capital flight, widening the gap in our inevitable two-tier system of have and have not. Normally, when someone posts an opinion in a forum, it's the task of the questioner to provide references to challenge that statement, allowing the original poster to refute the challenge.

When seniors, the largest voting block in America and primarily existing on government checks disbursing more than those voters paid in, are combined with the 20-million Americans receiving one form or another of government financial aid, elections have become a popularity contest of who can promise to deliver the most in public funds, available or not, to those who made the lowest, if any, contribution.

"01-26-2005","1649",5,"Tigerlilly","None","This is largely a false dichotomy. There is more than two solutions: privatise and keep them on perma-welfare. It's also a strawman, since I am not saying they shoudo feed off the public for their entire lives for any reason Keep beating the strawman till you knock it over, but that's not my possition. 1. YOu have yet to prove that life didn't suck for the majority in the 18th and 19th century unless they were poor or upper middle class. The situation ony got better with mixed system. 1. It should be very easy for you to cut and past from this source and link to it. I am not going to do your homework for you. Telling and showing from a credible source are 2 different things. 2. Secondly, the above doesn't show how much money goes to the poor via charity compared to government. THe government could entirely waste a lot, yet still have more helped. All it shows (from what you are saying anyway) is that there is less corruption, less bureaucracy, and more efficiency. It says zippo about who's helped the most. THe end justifies the means. Do you have evidence that MORE people are helped? This statistic you use is misleading. You can have 100% efficiency with 5 million dollars, or 30% efficiency with 100 million dollars +. If given alternatives: say tw, even with inefficiencies, and if more benefit with A than with B, you ought to do A. It's the heart of UP. Unless smal lprivate charities can donate hundreds of bililions of dollars, according tothe gov' budget for welfare, medicaid, medicare, then they are going to be hard pressed to prove a good safety net for people. the free market is very efficient at distributing private goods, moreso than a centralized economy. However efficiency means the absence of waste and deadweight losses, it does NOT include equity. The absence of a unique and mathematically derived yardstick to measure the relative import of equity versus efficiency is the main reason that the equity versus efficiency debate is primarily political not economic. --sd.net A problem with libertarianism is it relies on MASS donations and charity, which goes AGAINST human nature. People will not donate lots of money or enough to cover the costs of what is needed to make an equitible, morally just society. Charity is only as reliable as its donors, and frankly, Americans are selfish *******s. It would take over a power of ten increase in charitable giving to make up the difference, and I kind of doubt that would happen in any realistic world. sd.net","daewoo","88296","How would one go about proving that? Census data from the time does not include poverty figures. We DO know that the economic situation from the time period was not one that was generally considered conducive to poverty. We were running a radically positive trade balance and taxes were virtually nill. During the 18th century, we were so hard up for labor that we were using endentured servitude to get people over here, and they were lining up around the block to get on the boat, so something must have looked pretty good to them. I have been reading economic reports on such things for years. I am not going to do your homework for you. If you want to refute it, feel free to do soo (you won't be able to). No fari pointing out that social security historically has spent between 1-3% of total revenue on administration costs. Since total revenue for SS over the years has been more than benifits delivered by several orders of magnitude, that tells us nothing (and frankly is a slimy liberal trick). Maybe this is why they say that if you are young and don't vote liberal you have no heart, and when you get older, if you don't vote conservative, you have no brain. Odds are less people are helped by private charities at this point, since most Americans don't feel any particular obligation ot help the poor privatly, since it is supposedly all done at a public level. In business, there is a thing called a CBA, or ""cost/benifit analysis"". It is how you decide if you are using your money wisely. Those like yourself who advocate the governement handling any more than is absolutly necessary, need to learn how to do a CBA. In facty, I think that if anybody in government knew how to do a CBA we would be in better shape. If, you have the opportunity to spend 100 billion dollars and help 100 people, or spend 1 billion dollars and help 50 people in the same manner, obviously the wise thing to do is go with the 1 billion dollar program, and encourage it to expand (or do it 100 times). This is why we have snipers in the military. A grunt with a machine gun can spray a lot of bullets and put down a lot of guys. A sniper can fire one, take down the commander, and end the battle. Again, you really need to do a CBA on this. It is not just a matter of helping the poor, it is a matter of helping the poor without bankrupting your nations. As I said before, this is pretty much a moot point since witht the trade defcits, budgetary deficits and production numbers we are putting out, there will soon not be enoguh money to run social programs anyway. This is largely the result of doing things your way. 3. No evidence provided about these local charities. ALl heresay and sources people have to go looking for. That's unreasonable. An interesting quote, though it lacks examination of the cost of equity, which is pivitol to any such conversation. No, it doesn't. It relies mostly on building a strong economy, which minimizes the need for social welfare programs, like what we had for the majority of this nations history. We know what kind of economic factors lead to poverty. You can either slap a bandaid on it (social programs) or you can treat the root of the problem. Unfortunatly in putting a bandaid on it, we have aggrevated the actual problem. If you are running an economy where there is a job surplus and you are not dragging your people down with out of control taxation, you don't need the huge social programs that you do if you are running an economy that has a job deficit. Currently, there are people in this country who simply cannot get a job. There aren't enough jobs out there for everybody, and employers can afford to be highly selective regarding who they hire. What is ""sd.net""? Whoever or whatever it is, they are wrong. Private charitable contributions in 2003 were in excess of $240 billion. You want to calculate 240,000,000,000^10? It is a really, really big number. More money than we have in this country, and likely more money than we have in the entire world. Who is making these idiotic statements?","political-stance-helps-country-more","12:11 PM","government-debates","74"
