I agree that is a major difference between the right and left. The left does feel, I believe, that the rich should pay more than the poor. I do disagree, however, with your statement about how hard it is for the rich to stay rich. Capitalism is based upon the premise that wealth creates more wealth. True companies go bankrupt and lose money. But I ask how often the CEO, etc. actually become poor from this? Also, what do you mean exactly by rich people shouldn't pay more? For example, simply that we should take the budget of the US, and divide it by the population, and eveyone pay the same amount?

"02-05-2004","1649",1,"None","None","None","AMD4EVER","33918","OK, well democrats favor things such as gay marriage, taxes on the rich to give to the poor, higher tax rates, open borders, larger government, smaller military, internationalism, pro environment, anti death penalty, and most of all social justice. Basically this seems to me to show that the democrats believe that large government can do better than small government, if everyone had the same amount of money it would be good, the environment is more important than business, and our country should be open to everyone. These are all very idealistic things that in theory if they all worked would create a wonderful society. If we could simply just open our borders to everyone and have it work out just dandy that would be great. If we could have a clean environment while having businesses be successful that would be great. If the poor could just take money from the rich to improve their lives which not affecting the rich people's lifestyle that would be great. If the government actually was efficient enough and successful enough to be able to spend our money better than individuals can spend their money and use this to improve all our lives that would be great. The democrats are idealistic in my view and perhaps one day they will be able to achieve their goals and make this dream of theirs come true. However their long term plan is one that I cannot see them succeeding on if they were given control of the country today. Republicans however seem to try to do what they can for society and basically allow individuals and businesses do the rest. Capitalism works in such as way that this can be successful right now. The only reason the government even needs to be in place is to uphold the laws and control the military. Other than that the society would simply run all by itself without any help. That is basically my view of what the republicans are trying to do and it seems realistic to me. It will of course hurt the environment and not solve world hunger anytime soon but it is at least a good plan based on the governments current capabilities. But don't get me wrong here, I'm not saying all republicans think this way and clearly Bush does not and clearly Clinton was not the democrat that I speak of here. I'm just talking about the goals of the average republican and average democrat and assuming they had 100% control over the country. I think the democrat government would try to control more than they had the ability to control and society would fall apart because of their vision while the republican government would allow the American society to continue on. Still, the best thing for the US may just be that a mix of democrats and republicans hold office and both sides are compeitively trying to help the society. In that way we can get the best of both sides.","political-stance-helps-country-more","08:06 AM","government-debates","9"

I also think that much of what is 'right' is a matter of opinion, but I I do believe that on most social issues, whether they are right or wrong forthe nation, and the world for that matter is moving, has been moving, and will continue to move in a direction more in line with the stances of the Democratic party. I guess I mean primarily in what I consider to be mostly civil rights issues. For example, The civil rights movement in the 60's I think most would agree was an issue championed much more by Dems than Republicans. Currently, gay rights, for example...I mean does anyone really think that in 100 years gay people aren't going to be allowed to marry?","political-stance-helps-country-more","12:45 AM","government-debates","11"

I think that you do need a balance of both, but I do think that conservatism helps our country more. Liberals tend to go the way of appeasement, complete tolerance (which is not a good thing, despite what you hear in school), and cooperation with the UN. Conservatives seem to be much more of confronting enemies and evil head on, they're don't really believe in total tolerance (which is a good thing really, but very very dangerous), and are more independent in a national way.","political-stance-helps-country-more","03:11 AM","government-debates","12"

Personally, I think that many conservatives are more idealistic and unrealistic. Generally, conservatives seem to be in favor of less federal government involvement in things. This often seems to manifests itself in the idea that corporations can regulate themselves, and be fair to their workers and the environment (something I think is unrealistic and idealistic) and that states can be trusted to do what is right for their people. (Also, I believe, this is often unrealistic and idealisitc as shown by the south's attitude to segration.) Don't get me wrong, I love the idea that corporations can be trusted, and that states should be allowed to govern themselves, but history just does not seem to indicate this is true. I like states and corporations to have freedom, but to think that there is no need for any kind of oversight is, I think, idealistic, and unrealistic.","political-stance-helps-country-more","03:59 PM","government-debates","16"

The next logical step that our country should take is trying to convince other countries to adopt our views. Things like womens rights can only be taken so far, the line was crossed a few years ago with Roe vs Wade, which made the killing of the weakest members of society legal. Somewhat similar to a cooling graph, the liquid of society supercools past the line and then stabilizes. Civil rights can be taken too far, but then again so can control.

The poor will no longer be hungry and will have a nicer place to stay, the rich will not work their lives away and spend more time with their families, and everyone in between should receive a little of both. If you want a country that will always be strong and always be leading the way in technology and economics then you will want the right wing perspective. People don't come second in this outlook I don't believe, but their overall importance does drop while the economic aspects increase. This is not a bad thing for all people either. The potential for a better standard of living exists in this view although I believe it is rarely achieved because people have to spend so much time and effort working towards it and when they reach it, they don't even know how to relax and enjoy it.

Under such a sytem of voluntary charity, there is no such thing as a professional welfare recipient. Traditionally, private charities have been known to give a hand up, not a hand out. If you look at the difference in placement in private housing programs as opposed to public housing programs (not to mention the quality of housing provided), private job services as opposed to public job services, etc... It becomes almost immeditly (and painfully) obvious that despite the fact that government funding for such programs severely overshadows private funding (we are talking several orders of magnitude), the private programs actually place more people in homes, and put more people in jobs, than the government programs. Until after the new deal, poverty numbers in this country were not routinely kept. Poverty was considered a temporary situation. You fell on hard times, you went to a church (nearly every church had a indigent fund to help you out), or to the salvation army, or goodwill, and they would help you out with paying your bills and keeping your family fed until you could find a new job or get something going as far as putting some money in your pocket. But it has always worked. You can argue all you want that it is sporadic or inefficient, but the longest running charitable program in the world has been running out of the basement of a church in boston since 1802. Even if people cannot be fully expected to give out money from the goodness of their hearts, they can certainly be expected to do it for the tax break. Of course you would. you prefer a nanny state. I just thank god that there are millions of Americans out there oiling their bolt carriers just waiting for the chance to shoot those who think along the same lines as you should your type ever actually gain enough power to make a significant difference. Not that it really matters.

Cash is running out of here at the rate of a trillion + per year, JUST in trade deficit (not even going to touch on things like debt service, foreign aid, etc...).

We must make sure that everyone has a net of safety if they really choose to work and contribute to society. The poor shouldn't be on an equal standard of living to the wealthy, but from a Utilitarian POV, and according to Rawlsian justice, you ought to have them have equal opportunity to offices and programs. Everyone should have at least an equal basic foundation provided. I don't believe charaties can provide for these goals on the scale required. They haven't done that well in the past, and the populations have only gotten larger and needs have gotten greater. It's basically relying on people's good will to help others, which as we see in Communism--is relatively non-existent. I don't donate to charity, and I probably never would unless I am required to.

Prior to the great depression starting in 1929, when the US was still primarily a rural society, midwifes often arbitrarily made the decision of whether or not newborn children were physically capable of entering society in a contributing manner or if affordable. While I'm not suggesting such draconian measures as a solution to our current problems, some method of birth control will be required to successfully maintain any social program caring for those who are unable or unwilling to care for themselves. If you want graphic examples of what a complete lack of birth control can achieve without fiscal capability to care for it, go to most large Mexican or S.

It seems your definition of ""sucked"" is ""you could not just feed off the public teat for your entire life"". If that is the case, you are entirely correct. BUT, at the same time, you actually had a chance to do something with your life. Department of housing and urban development issues a quarterly report re:housing placement and availability. Labor department keeps data on government job placement programs. For private programs you have to ""go to the source"". The problem with your plan is the waste inherent to any government program. With 80% of total revenue going to cover administrative costs being considered acceptable, and 50% being considered fairly high for a government program, only a relatively small fraction of the total money ""donated"" through taxation actually provides any benifit to the poor. Local privet charities, though (which I differetiate from large national charities because most f the large national charities have number no better, and often worse, than their government counterparts), have a flowthrough of nearly 80%, and in many cases 100%, since they often rely on volunteer labor and donated facilities. Try to find the numbers. Go ahead. They simply are not out available. If the taxation in question actually resulted in the majority of those funds ending up assisting the poor, there wouldn't be a problem. Again, you fail to address the inefficiency inherent to government programs. That seems to be the achilles heel of you entire thought process. It is why socialist societies inevitably fail. We spenmd huge amounts of money for relatively small gains, at the same time stifiling industry and depriving them of low cost labor, which decreases opportunities to exit from poverty. As long as you are runnign a job surplus and your economy is growing, poverty can be written off as a temporary. At the end of the day, we have tried both ways. Mine worked. Yours didn't. Not only did yours not work, it has led to the breeding of a sub class of people.....professional welfare recipients.

YOu have yet to prove that life didn't suck for the majority in the 18th and 19th century unless they were poor or upper middle class. The situation ony got better with mixed system. 1. It should be very easy for you to cut and past from this source and link to it. I am not going to do your homework for you. Telling and showing from a credible source are 2 different things. 2. Secondly, the above doesn't show how much money goes to the poor via charity compared to government. THe government could entirely waste a lot, yet still have more helped. All it shows (from what you are saying anyway) is that there is less corruption, less bureaucracy, and more efficiency. It says zippo about who's helped the most. THe end justifies the means. Do you have evidence that MORE people are helped? This statistic you use is misleading. You can have 100% efficiency with 5 million dollars, or 30% efficiency with 100 million dollars +. If given alternatives: say tw, even with inefficiencies, and if more benefit with A than with B, you ought to do A. It's the heart of UP. Unless smal lprivate charities can donate hundreds of bililions of dollars, according tothe gov' budget for welfare, medicaid, medicare, then they are going to be hard pressed to prove a good safety net for people. the free market is very efficient at distributing private goods, moreso than a centralized economy. However efficiency means the absence of waste and deadweight losses, it does NOT include equity. The absence of a unique and mathematically derived yardstick to measure the relative import of equity versus efficiency is the main reason that the equity versus efficiency debate is primarily political not economic. --sd.net A problem with libertarianism is it relies on MASS donations and charity, which goes AGAINST human nature. People will not donate lots of money or enough to cover the costs of what is needed to make an equitible, morally just society. Charity is only as reliable as its donors, and frankly, Americans are selfish *******s. It would take over a power of ten increase in charitable giving to make up the difference, and I kind of doubt that would happen in any realistic world. sd.net","daewoo","88296","How would one go about proving that? Census data from the time does not include poverty figures. We DO know that the economic situation from the time period was not one that was generally considered conducive to poverty. We were running a radically positive trade balance and taxes were virtually nill. During the 18th century, we were so hard up for labor that we were using endentured servitude to get people over here, and they were lining up around the block to get on the boat, so something must have looked pretty good to them. I have been reading economic reports on such things for years. I am not going to do your homework for you. If you want to refute it, feel free to do soo (you won't be able to). No fari pointing out that social security historically has spent between 1-3% of total revenue on administration costs. Since total revenue for SS over the years has been more than benifits delivered by several orders of magnitude, that tells us nothing (and frankly is a slimy liberal trick). Maybe this is why they say that if you are young and don't vote liberal you have no heart, and when you get older, if you don't vote conservative, you have no brain. Odds are less people are helped by private charities at this point, since most Americans don't feel any particular obligation ot help the poor privatly, since it is supposedly all done at a public level. In business, there is a thing called a CBA, or ""cost/benifit analysis"". It is how you decide if you are using your money wisely. Those like yourself who advocate the governement handling any more than is absolutly necessary, need to learn how to do a CBA. In facty, I think that if anybody in government knew how to do a CBA we would be in better shape. If, you have the opportunity to spend 100 billion dollars and help 100 people, or spend 1 billion dollars and help 50 people in the same manner, obviously the wise thing to do is go with the 1 billion dollar program, and encourage it to expand (or do it 100 times). This is why we have snipers in the military. A grunt with a machine gun can spray a lot of bullets and put down a lot of guys. A sniper can fire one, take down the commander, and end the battle. Again, you really need to do a CBA on this. It is not just a matter of helping the poor, it is a matter of helping the poor without bankrupting your nations. As I said before, this is pretty much a moot point since witht the trade defcits, budgetary deficits and production numbers we are putting out, there will soon not be enoguh money to run social programs anyway. This is largely the result of doing things your way. 3. No evidence provided about these local charities. ALl heresay and sources people have to go looking for. That's unreasonable. An interesting quote, though it lacks examination of the cost of equity, which is pivitol to any such conversation. No, it doesn't. It relies mostly on building a strong economy, which minimizes the need for social welfare programs, like what we had for the majority of this nations history. We know what kind of economic factors lead to poverty. You can either slap a bandaid on it (social programs) or you can treat the root of the problem. Unfortunatly in putting a bandaid on it, we have aggrevated the actual problem. If you are running an economy where there is a job surplus and you are not dragging your people down with out of control taxation, you don't need the huge social programs that you do if you are running an economy that has a job deficit. Currently, there are people in this country who simply cannot get a job. There aren't enough jobs out there for everybody, and employers can afford to be highly selective regarding who they hire. What is ""sd.net""? Whoever or whatever it is, they are wrong. Private charitable contributions in 2003 were in excess of $240 billion. You want to calculate 240,000,000,000^10?

People don't donate nearly as much as is needed and that the Fed's can offer because they are lazy and greedy and people naturally don't give a **** until, they are forced to give a ****. Yes. I know about marginal analsys and opportunity cost. It's all quite irrelevant to the fact that people will not donate enough money. The didn't prior, and they won't now, and they won't in the future when you regress back to the level of 18th 19th century.

YOu don't have to get EVERYONE and you don't have to spend on all projects, but choose wisely. Not everyone needs to be protected. You help as many as you can without destroying the economy. Taxation is important. Conservatives in the government can't manage their spending. They spend on pointless projects, cut taxes, and then go to war. That's another problem.

It also called for strengthening our industrial infrastructure, which would provide millions of good paying production jobs. The libertarian formula relies on the fact that in a capitolist society, not only are prices based on the principals of supply and demand, so is labor. Maybe you can show me an example of a capitolistic economy where there was a large job surplus and poverty was a problem, or unemployment was a problem. During the 17th and 18th centuries in America, employers certianly had the option of simply dismissing their labor force. They didn't do it, though, because with such a massive labor shortage (due to the rapidly growing economy) that to do so would have been to cut their own throat. Since the government was only spendiung about 5% of our GDP, and the labor wagesw ere based ona labor shortage, people bought their own health care. It was not until WWII and the wage caps that came with it that companies started providieng healt benifits for their people (as a way around the wage caps). Then, people decided that there is no reason that those who have not worked for their health care should be deprived of it, so we ended up with governemtn healt care programs and all the inefficiencies that came with it. Sorry, if you want to refute, it is your responsibility to do so, THEN, I come back and spank you with my sources. Thats the way it works in about any debating situation. thi is not a classroom, it is a debate. It certianly sounds like you are having trouble finding data with which to refute. Here are a couple of places you can start: http://www.lib.umich.edu/govdocs/stats.html http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/colle...ts/histcensus/ The second is a census browser for old census data. Maybe you can find poverty numbers for the 17th and 18th century that support your claims (though you cannot, since the data was not even kept). OR, it could be that if the governemtn was not spending over 50% of our GDP on all levels, including regualtory costs and debt service, there would be more money in our pockets, which would almost certianly lead to higher charitable contributions. No, it is not. You would make a good politician.....just throw money at the problem until it goes away. Maybe you could point us towards and efficient government, or an efficiantly run government program. I nhave not seen one to date, so am having trouble visualising one. The problem with this plan is that nobdy really seems to have aconcrete definition of ""pork"" or ""trimming the fat"". What programs would you cut? Which pograms are providing as little benifit to society as a whole as our social programs? Since it is already fairly well established that a strong, growing, productive economy is possibly the most effective way to combat poverty (i.e if there truly is a job for every person, you can effectively cut social programs and know with a farily large degree of confidence that anybody who is unemployed is simply lazy), doesn't it make more sense to cut the social programs and turn that money back over to industry as expansion capitol? I would argue that since social programs inevitably breed laziness, socail programs are the ""fat"" that we need to be trimming. Socail programs are detrimental to any economy. I have not seen a single economic system that spends massively on social programs that has suceeded in the long run. As spending on social programs goes up, there is less capitol available for expansion. In addition, when you make it profitable fro people to NOT work, only a fool would be out there working. So not only have you killed off your expansion capitol, you have effectively removed the lower end of your labor pool from consideration as well. No. You want to refute, do so. If not, you can concede the point. Then provide some (that would be you refuting). Keep in mind that we are discussing 18th and 19th century America, not europe (which is a whole different ballgame). No, I provide my analysis of the data which has been available to me. You refute, then I come back and proe my statements (or, more properly, disprove yours). The problem here seems to be that you lack the sources to launch a proper counter. If that is the case, you concede graciously, you don't start bawling ""prove it"" like a child on a playground.

It has been a lot of years since there was any incentive to get off welfare here in the US. Most people who are currently on welfare never get off, and when their kids get old enough to collect (since they inevitably reproduce, we build benifits for reproduction into the system), they take their kids down and sign them up. The more kids you have, the more money you get, so we are effectively encouraging the dregs of society to reproduce at a disporportionatly high rate, thus ensuring that future generations will have even MORE layabouts to support. I can certainly understand the reluctance of any major political party to address the issue (that is the case here, too) since nothing motivates career welfare recipients to get out and vote like the suggestion that they might have to get a job. Personally, I have no problem with reasonable social programs. It is certainly cheaper and easier to pay off the lower end of society than it is to have to hold them back by force. When you are encouraging them to breed, and providing no incentive for them to improve their situation, it will not take long before there are more of them than the system can handle.

Private charities did very little for the poor and the massive poverty realistically began to subside after the age of mass society, which was after socialism and the libertarian model began to disintegrate. Although Americans have long celebrated their nation's wealth and the abundance of its resources, poverty has been omnipresent in American history. From the colonial period to the present day, large numbers of Americans have been poor: they have lacked the resources to feed, clothe, and shelter themselves adequately according to socially defined standards. Just how many Americans have lived in poverty over the course of more than three centuries is impossible to gauge; not only are data scarce, but the definition of poverty has changed too often (and is too subject to debate) to permit precise measurement. Nonetheless, there can be no doubt that poverty, as a personal condition and as a social problem, has long been a prominent feature of the economic and social landscape.

"01-30-2005","1649",9,"Tigerlilly","None","It's not just that source. It's corroborated by other books and peer reviewed journals. It's highly unlikely they just make it up. It's not my job to find out how they get the information, only that it's part of a legitimate academic source. Being part of a college curriculum means it's highly likely that it's accurate and worth something. Despite the currently popular view that poverty was widespread in America from colonial times to the early 20th century, no evidence has been found to corroborate this. The majority of material suggesting this to be the case focuses on large port cities such as New York, Boston and Sacramento without taking into account the fact that the poverty levels in such cities was driven almost entirely by millions of new immigrants arriving every year from Europe primarily for the purpose of escaping poverty. Besides being illogical to believe that millions of emigrants seeking to escape poverty chose as their destination a country with a high poverty level, charitable records from the time do not support this viewpoint. The only extensive records from the period which address the issue are the records from charitable organizations. In analyzing the records from the 100 largest organizations, it becomes apparent that while the poverty level in New York and Boston may well have approached 25%, the poverty level in the united states as a whole was less than 2% Source was provided from an academic unit. That's enough, since it say sthe opposite, and textbooks in colleges as well as the journals on their databases are selected and reviewed. 1. I agreed with you on one, and I still do. 2. THe second one I am correct, since all historical sources say the same, and I am only required to provide those sources. I could care less how they come to that conclusion. I am not the curriculm. 2 is contrary to mainstream history, therefore I don't buy into it, and neither ought you. 3. Apparently they have information, since this isn't the only source which states the massive problem. It's also in the New International, Spielvogel's text, as well as Zinn's text. That's three academic college sources. I'm not going to disagree with them over the opinion of some guy on a webboard. They are good enough for Universities and the lecturers, they are good enough for me In regards to the first point about proving #3, I don't mind providing you with information when I have the chance. However, I use historical resources that are credible and widely used. I do want the information available to come out, regardless of who's it is. It would be dishonest otherwise, don't you think? Secondly, you didn't argue your points about the 18th and 19th centuries, since you have no records of the time, as you admit, because ""census"" date of the time wasn't ""kept on it,"" as you say. This means it could or could not have been a problem, regardless of their lack of keeping a good record, if that were the case. Historical texts/journals disagree with you, so they most likley have another way of finding the information required. I provided the sources. You don't have to agree with the source, but that doesn't make your case. My job is done; I provided a source which countered your lack of any resources on the topic, despite the burden of proof belonging to you. All texts say the same thing, and most credible historians agree, therefore I am not going to disagree with them. It's unlikely they are wrong. That's critical enough. You must have a problem with History sources. 1. The article describes data as scarce, but not non-existent. They obviously got them from somewhere else. Statistics aren't the only historical methods used. It's nOt my job in this discussion to find out where and to criticise mainstream historical sources. If there were a problem, the myriad researchers would have found it. This is like those people comming up with counters to evolution that they think are unique, as if the researchers of mainstream had not already taken care of that problem. THat's beyond the credible provided academic sources. I'll trust my peer reviewed journals and texts. Impossible is largely hyperbole, since it's not impossible due to the fact that they have rounded numbers, personal accounts of the period, primary documents, and collected, but scarce data from the periods. An inquiry into the cause of industrial depressions and of the increase of want with increase of wealth... The Remedy by Henry George Quote: Not everyone shared in the economic prosperity of this period. Many workers were typically unemployed at least part of the year, and their wages were relatively low when they did work. This situation led many workers to support and join labor unions. Meanwhile, farmers also faced hard times as technology and increasing production led to more competition and falling prices for farm products. Hard times on farms led many young people to move to the city in search of better job opportunities In the 19th century no special concern existed over children or women doing hard work; they had always worked within the family on farms, etc. By 1890 18% of the labor force consisted of children between the ages of 10 and 15. A state of quasi slavery existed where parents bound children to working; child labor was not really addressed until the Progressive Era. Quote: Industrial safety was a large issue: factory work was very dangerous, and it was difficult if not impossible to hold factory owners responsible for deaths and injuries. Around 1900 25-35,000 deaths and 1 million injuries per year occurred on industrial jobsmany of them railroad jobs, which were very dangerous. Fires, machine accidents, wrecks, etc. were common There was no federal regulation of safety and no enforcement of safety regulations.. Insurance and pensions were rare The cost of living during the pre-socialist years was three times as high as the wages paid to the masse who made up 80% of the population. In the 1850s the cost of living rose 12%, wages only 4%. http://www.nv.cc.va.us/home/nvsageh/...WorkingMen.htm Personal accounts and primary sources of poverty wide-spread among the working and lower middle class. In the fifteen years I have worked as a miner I have earned the average rate of wages any of us coal heavers get. To-day I am little better off than when I started to do for myself. I have $100 on hand; I am not in debt; I hope to be able to weather the strike without going hungry.","daewoo","88822","And yet in A New Economic View of American history: From Colonial Times to 1940 , Jeremy Atack Susan Lees and Peter Passell note: If you are interested in poverty in early America, the book is a must have. Their methodology in regards to the question of poverty is interesting. They obtained the records from charitable organizations and used those to study the issue. In reality, I think that their methodology may be a little skewed to the high side, though, since they assume that everybody who sought assistance, or whom the organization identified as being eligible for aid, lived in poverty. One of the organizations they used was The YMCA, including information from the Boston YMCA. The boston YMCA had, as one if its services, A free clinic that treated 73,363 new patients in 1891 and dispensed 85,752 prescriptions. These patients are included in the poverty roster. I think it is unreasonable to assume that everybody who shows up at a free clinic is necessarily living in poverty. They also included estimations from the catholic church regarding poverty (since the catholic church was the biggest charitable organization in the US during the specified period). The catholic church considered anybody in America who did not have at least 1 room for every two people in their home and 3 changes of clothing for everybody in the household to be living in poverty. While today this would certainly be considered poverty, I think they set the bar a little high for the time. It seems to me that they did this to increase the numbers (since, as Atack and Pasall note, poverty was fairly rare) in order to solicit larger donations. I remember being chastised by professors in college for not viewing things with a critiacl eye. Once in particular I was berated rather badly by an economics professor for simply repeating what I had read in a textbook. He said ""Mr Daewoo (nake changed to protect the innocent), does the text you just recited from give any numbers to support that statement, or explain the methodology they used to make the determination?"" ""no"" ""Does is provide any insight at all as to how the numbers were obtained, or any frame of reference as to how one might confirm those numbers?"" ""no"" ""Then how do you know that what you are reciting as fact is indeed fact?"" ""Well, it is in the textbook. Surely somebody has checked it."" ""Mr Daewoo, I wrote that textbook. What you just recited as fact was my personal opinion at the time, and I can assure you that nobody checked it for accuracy, as it has since been proven to be incorrect. You are not going to go far in this world if you do not learn to view things with a critical eye."" That was not an uncommon exchange when I was in college, so I admit that my view of what constitutues ""proof"" is slightly higer than ""Somebody wrote it in a textbook."" If it does not include methodology, raw data, or even an explanation of how the ""fact"" was arrived at, it is not ""proof"". What I posted above is ""proof"". It makes a statement, explains the basis for that statement, clearly identifies the authors, and gives anough information about source that you could (if you felt so disposed and had the time available) check the vlaidity of it yourself. The book explains the full methodology used to arrive at the conclusions they have regarding poverty in early America, including Giving alist of over 200 charitable organization, the record of which are the basis for their conclusion. THAT, is credible evidence. If you need, I can put up the whole list of organizations they used, or thier section on methodology. They actually concluded that only about half of those eleigible for applied or asked for aid, and included the prmise in their final calculation, which I think probably skews them more towards the high end. This is common in the academic world, it makes it easier to defend your work. A quote that starts with ""we don't have the data to support this, but here is what we think"" is no ""credible evidence"". What has happened to College? It used ot be you memorized facts in high school, then in college they taught you to think. Now it seems that you memorize fact in high school, and in college they teach you to think like everybody else. No wonder college grads and college students have taken on so many charachteristics of mindless drones. Then whay did you ask me to prove it? And I have refuted your sources. Beyond that, I have questioned the credibility of them. The fact that they are the textbook your classes use does not make them ""credible"". You now need to either defend your sources or, if they cannot be defended, find new ones. In order for a source to be credible, at the very least methodology and data sources must be explained. As you are still a student, I doubt you know a whole lot about ""mainstream history"", though I would imagine that you know a lot about the curriculem at your school. David Horowitz has written a lot of stuff, most of it better written and better documented than what you have provided here. A lot of what he writes is easily disproven garbage, though. Bellisiles and Finkleman have also written a lot of stuff, again, most of it (especially bellisiles work) is much closer to ""credible source"" than what you have posted here. His Gun study cites data and explains methodology. Of course, when you look at his data and methodology you quickly discover that he is a fraud, but at least he provided it. As an interesting side note, before being exposed as a fraud and subsequently dismissed from his postion in disgrace, he collaborated on several textbooks, some of which are already being used to indoctorinate a new generation of wide eyed Americna college student to (apparently) accept things unquestioningly. I suspect that in the next 5 years we will have to disprove his work all over again, since so much of it already made it into textbooks. Yet another intelectual inbred saying ""It is a fact because it is in my textbooks, and THAT is mainstream history"". This is why you must always think critically and never accept ""facts"" just because they are in print. If they are not independantly verifiable, or their basis is not explained, they are questrionable at best. There are others out there. Like Bellisiles, working from a faulty or even fraudulent basis, who are right now collaborating on new textbooks. As are the text books that Bellisiles collaborated on. Again, if no methodology is expalined, and no basis for the observation is explained, it is an opinion, not a fact, nor is it even a credible source. Besides, what you provided was opinions regarding #3, not #2. #2 focuses on the economic condition of the United states and whether or not it was conducive to poverty. This is not something you argue with regard to whether poverty existed, or whether poverty was a problem. It is strictly an economics question. What I am saying here is that generally economic conditions conducive to poverty include slow, flatline, or even negative economic growth, high levels of unemployment, low availability of industrial materials (raw materials for manufacture.....this requires that employers cut wages badly in order to cover the increased price of raw materials). I would even go so far as to include immigration numbers in this, since coutries that have a problem with poverty do not experience population growth due to immigration. Some do experience dometic population growth if there is a high level of infant mortality (since people have more children as theri odds of survival decrease), but immigration growth in nations with high rates of poverty is null. Since it is widely understood that American economic growth prior to the 20th century was phenomemnal, sometimes so large as to be damaging, and that this economic growth led to a job surplus, and that we saw a massive influx of emigrants during the time period, and that we had the cheapest raw materials on the planet at the time, would you like to just concede this point, and we can move forward to the question of how many people DID live in poverty, and the causes for that poverty? Still sounds an awful lot like you don't have any real data and are looking to use mine. It also sounds like maybe you are coming around, realising that ""historical resources"" which do not explain methodology, or even the most basic reasoning regarding their observations are questionable at best. Thre may be hope for the younger generation yet. I base my argument on the baove cited work, as well as a dozen or so other tomes I have on my shelf that use a similar methodology. Studying poverty in the early part of Americas history has always been problematic due to lack of data availibility. Susan Lee developed the concept of using charitable organizations record to estimate the scale of the poverty problem in early America. Since then, at least a dozen historians have adopted it to one degree or another. Since other records are either horribly incomplete or entirely non existant, and the records of charitable organizations from the time are the only complete records regarding poverty that we have from that time period, the idea caught on fairly well. While there is only limited data that can be gleaned from the records in question, it is nearly inarguably more credible than other guesses regrading poverty at the time, since we already know that other methodologies are basing their opinion son either incomplete data or no data at all. I have no problem with history sources, provided that they provide methodology and explain how they arrived at their conclusion. Otherwise it is just fluff, the opinion of the author. How many researcher do you really htink spend time checking the validity of textbooks? I know that one physics text used at MIT contains at least a half dozen glarign errors. It is common knowledge among students there. They have not ben corrected, though (since most text books are short run). Depending on how good your professor is, he MIGHT point out the errors. Some do not, though. I think this is kind of a test of who is actualyl a worthy pupil and who is not. If you don't catch the errors, and account for them, you almost certianly fail the course (since they are fundamental errors which increase in magnitude as the subject matter becomes more complex). Again, methodology, or at least basis for opinion, if you want it to be regarded as a credible source. This is why research still goes on. What revision is your text book on? I still have a coupel of text books on my shelf from the college days. On is a history text. It is on its 23rd revision. You really think that is because they were so right 23 times that they needed to update? If everything written about history in textbooks and journals was correct, there would be no research, since we already know everything (especially in regards to history, since it has already happened). If it makes you feel any better, I once held the same misconception as you about poverty in our nations history. It was not until I started studying economics that I stopped and went ""Hey, wait a minute, why would we have such high poverty in an economy like THAT. Even the bad years were better than anything we have seen in the last 50 years"". I was then that I started taking a serious look at the history materials I had read on the subject (at the time, I,lie you, was a wide eyed socio fascist with little or no understanding of how the world actually worked, and my views were based largely on the mainly liberal leanings of my soft science professors (literature, history, etc...). As you delve a little deeper into your sources, you will likey find that most of the opinions expressed are based on 3 main sources: 1-firsthand obswervations of the living conditions of the poor, but without taking into account that such firsthand observations invariably center on the worst conditions the author could find to describe 2-Limited data available from New York, Boston, and other port cities, but without taking into account the masisve number of poor emigrants who arriving daily (which really does beg the question, why were so many people coming ot America if it was indeed the land of squalid poverty?) 3- Pure conjecture on the part of the author. Those were the 3 identifible ""sources"" I found when I looked at the same question (that was the beginning of realization for me that an agenda was beig pushed, and not one based in intelligent thought). So, where did those rounded numbers come from? Vauge numbers ore often the result of no data, an idnicator that you are flying on faith. This has nothing to do with poverty. It says that small farms saw hard time (gee, really....) and that wages were relatively low. That is a no brainer as well. Small farmers are STILL having a rough time, and technology and increasing production are STILL driving the cost of farm goods down. That same technology also provided for greater output for the farms with less labor requirement. Today, children are still being driven off the farm and to the city to find jobs. In fact, this has increased. A family farm cannot justify keeping 4 kids around to do the work of one man. at one time, 80 acres was about all 2 men could handle. Now 80 acres is nothing. We have combines that cut a 25 ft swath and can effectively harvest at over 30 miles per hour. Here you are talking cultural differences between then and now. Prior to the technologialc farming revolution, kids stayed on their families farms for life, working along side dear old dad, and peopel knocked them out like it was going out of style due to lack of birth control and the need for labor on the farm During the early part of the 20th century, the leading cause of death in industrial accidents was boiler explosions. A boiler is an expensive piece of equipment. Do you really think that the factory owners were failing to maintain them in the safest manner possible (since a boiler explosion is about all that really happens with a boiler than kills people)? Metallurical advances led to better and safer boilers, which benifitted everybody. Technology made for a safer workplace. While I would certainly agree that government regulation has likely saved some lives, I think to give them too much credit is a farce. The provided data does not fit that statement. Here is the snippet you provided: That is a 12% INCREASE in the cost of living, and a 4% INCREASE in wages. That does not at all supprot the statement that the cost of living was 4 times as high as the wages provided, which is an idiotic and impossible statement. If you look at modern numbers that INCLUDE food and energy, which are generally excluded form COL calcualtions and inflationary calcualtions (I can only assume to keep from scaring the general public, since food and energy to heat your home when it is 2 degrees outside should certianly be considered part of the cost of living), we are doing worse today. Last year, real cost of living went up 8% and real wages went up less than 2%. If you include inflationary calcualtions (weakeneing dollar), the number is horrifying (the dolalr dropped 19% against other major currencies in 2003, and 15% in 2004) I am not sure why they don't include energy costs and food in these numbers, since they are certainly the basis of our economy. Even housing costs are not included in most COL calcualtions anymore (though they used to be). Again, I can only assume this is to keep the public complacent. Even juicy government COLA programs have not kept up with RCOL. This one can help you as well. As mentioned in an above article, prosperity is judged by those who experience the time. The wealthy upper class as well as the plutocracy thought wonders of the time, but the lower middle class, workers, and poor, did not, adn they made up the bulk of the population (75-80%). From the text: WOW, money on hand and NO DEBT. Considering the Average American has a NEGATIVE net worth today, most can only aspire to be as fortunate as this poor person. again, these are worthless as indicators of how wide spread poverty truly was, or what the average living condition for those in poverty are, since such accounts tend to focus on the most morbid conditions one could find in an attempt to highlight the point they are trying to convey. This is like looking at descriptions of the squalor of East St Louis and saying ""that is what America as a whole is like"". Read teh account of the chinese laundryman. He started out making $3.50 per week, but SAVED $3 of it, then got a raise to $5 per week, and SAVED $4.25. After 2 years of working a menial job, he had saved enoguh moeney to start a business. This is the kind of escape from pverty I was talking about, as well as a good example of why I think poverty was largely considered a temporary situation. In a strong, growing economy, anybody who is willing to work, and work hard, is able to get ahead. How long do you think you would have to work at Mc donalds today before you saved up enough cash to start your own business?

"01-30-2005","1649",10,"Tigerlilly","None","Well, the most common belief why many people came to america is because the poverty of europe was worse than America, but that doesn't mean that it was wonderful. The poverty problem was also hidden. Communication wasn't fast or reliable for many people, and America was propagandized as the land of opportunity where you could use social stratification to your advantage. I support SOME socialist programs, because not all are bad. I want to keep min wage laws, factory laws. I want limited aid packages. THere's a difference between a wacko-socialist and a mild socialist. If you can fix the poverty problem: reALLY fix it, and not having millions have no healthcare, no adequate living conditions, that's fine. As it stands now, how many people don't have healthcare? Is it like 10 million children? Should the government do nothing? What will happen when you get rid of any type of welfare and charities cannot (and won't) magically fill the void? Are people going to die? Even if the economy is running efficienty, which Libertarianism tries to do, there will be hundreds of thousands of people who will regardlessly live in poverty. It's not human nature to change and become productive if they aren't. Humans are inherently lazy as a species. I don't think politicians should pork barrel either, but I am for programs that alleviate suffering. I don't want wealth equalization or government domination of resources and capital. SO how do you say I am a fascist or Socialist? Are you a christian because you support (perhaps) some christian ideals? Some ideology does not a socialist make. So ridiculously low labour wages didn't contribute to the problem? How did they get higher wages? Not from Libertarianism, but from mild social policies and regulations. The farms really aren't the concern. It's the city dwellers. Farmers can be expected to decline. It's the wage and conditions of workers and middleclass. Really, we would be fortunate to not barely be able to get food? Most americans have a high standard of living today compared to that of the 19th century. It's considered that conditions in the cities that were selected aren't different from other urban cities. IT's doubtful they are. Oh i did read this. It's an exceptional story, but it doesn't reflect the majority. Entreprenurial ability is one of the 5 major scarce resources in Economics. Not everyone has this ability. If they don't, should they die and their families starve? He has a measly 100 dollars and hopes not to go hungry, which is a problem no one should have to deal with realisticially. YOu ought not have to worry if you are going to get your next meal or starve to death. YOu shouldn't have to have wages which are so low that you can barely feed your family. THe problem is now there are actual min. wage laws and wages are fairly good enough to survive for the majority of people. Then, they were not so lucky. If you do falter, there are also government programs that can help you. THen, you only had your local church or benevolent people to beg up. Now, the situation is getting worse as time goes on, yes. Poverty moves in shifts depending on certain policies and external influences. I never ment that the wages were 4 times lower. I miswrote that. What I meant was that the level of cost of living rose 4 x the ammount of the wages raising. It was bad then, and today's situation is bad too, but at least now wages are more in sync with costs, but that's changing. Back then, the wages were already already very low, as was the typical standard of acceptible living, especially for unskilled labour and low middleclass artisans etc.","daewoo","88884","Certainly not. You had to work for a living. So millions of people were completely duped by a marketing scam, in an age where there was no mass media? You could work hard and get ahead, which was little more than a pipe dream in the rest of the world. Only 11.4% of children did not have health insurance in 2003, according to the census bureau ( http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/hlthins/hlthins.html ). That is 8.4 million children, and over half of them are eligible for insurance but not enrolled. So....what....we provide health insurance for everybody at an inflated cost? I have a better idea, one that has actually not been shown historically to be an utter failure. How about if we cut those programs alltogether, lower taxes, and let people buy their own insurance? I am certianly not against all social programs. I have stated here before, in this very thread, that I am all for engouh social programs to keep the poor contained and compalcent enough to not riot. Beyond that, I don't think we should be prividing them anything. YES, some will die. Regardless of what you do, some will always die. It is inevitable. Always has been, always will be. To push for a 0 death rate is entirely unrealistic. We already have government domination of resources and capitol. It is not so much your economic views that make you a socialist or a fascist as much as your other views. you seem to be all for a state that is ""like a parent"", which is how the fascist state was described by Mussolini. Socialist prefer to call it ""big brother"". but the concept is the same. No, not really, especially since farm production is not tied to labor rates (in fact, if you look at economic reports ""non farm"" wages are a seperate calssification). They got higher wages due to increased labor demand. Barely be able to get food? On the same page there is an account by a chinese gentleman that claimed he made $3.50 a week and saved $3. This guy had $100 stacked away and no debt. That was likely 6 months pay. How many Americans do you think have 6 months pay in the bank and no debt? This guy was a miner, relatively unskilled labor, who had $100 at a time when $200 would buy you a farm with a house. How many unskilled laborers do you know to day that can make such a claim? So, authors are radically different today than they were back then? I mean, if you choose to write abotu poverty, you choose cases that best illustrate your point. Come on. The guy washed laundry by hand. YES, anybody can do that. If your premise was correct, why is it that even in 1900 the US had the higest standard of living in the world? If it was a question of entrepenurial ability (whihc I agree is rare), the majority of peopel would have been starving, which would likely have removed us from that particualr list alltogether. That is the point. In a healthy, growing economy, you do not have to posess incredible amounts of skill to get ahead, you simply have to be willing to show up and do your job. So, do you think he was worried about starvign becuase he was poor, or because he was a cola miner, which implies a remote location, and food simply became scarce in the winter due to the fact that game is harder to come by and winter transportation is unreliable at best, and the ability to store fresh produce was virtually non existant? Keep in mind that at the turn of the century a penny would get you 2 loaves of bread. Until recent years and the boom in professional welfare recipients, poverty has always been traced directly to economic factors. In a growing economy, wiht a low rate of unemployment, poverty was traditionally slight and temporary. With the social programs we have in place, poverty does not change much regardless of economic circumstance becuase there is no incintive for people to go to work./ In addition, massive socail programs have alwyas, without fail, in every situation where they have been tried, proved to be such a drain on the economy that it withered, causing more poverty. the wage was not ""very low"". There is this thing called ""inflation"". A dollar used to be a considerable sum of money. Pennies used to actually buy something. It is incredibly rare for cost of living to NOT rise faster than wages in the US. You will have about 25 years of incresaes in the cost of living without equal increses in the average wage, and then about a 5 yr cycle where the cost of living is heavily overshadowed by wage increases. It has always been this way. A 12% cost of living increase with a 4% wage increase is not remarkable or even bad.","political-stance-helps-country-more","08:13 PM","government-debates","143"

At that time we were requiring a grad degree (not in internal or published HR data) from primarily private schools as the public schools had turned to MBA programs for revenue sources. They were churning out primarily liberal arts types who thought they'd make big money in business with a quick program by stuffing them with theory bearing little resemblance to the real world. Needless to say, most were absolutely lost when faced with making even feeble attempts to understand structured circumstances and how problems were remedied. Most of us understood at that time the rumors of deteriorating education were indeed a fact; former high school knowledge levels were being pushed up to the undergrad level. The ability of many people able to think on their feet was being reduced to those who were obviously capable, and they were becoming few and far between. We were receiving human robots full of programming errors as America attempted to force all students into believing a college education would be their salvation. Business could easily see the American gravy train slowing down, anyone who didn't understand it with Regan's tax cuts had to be a shining example of the Peter Principle. The politicians knew at the same time, and education became a great horse to ride. Federal student loans made it a very controllable situation, allowing the powerful federal bureacracy to make all rules. Let them learn by questionable rote makes numbers. They either pass or fail a bar set by whatever text books they use. At a certain point capacity became a problem. That's pretty easy to sort out, the fed began applying qualifiers on how applicants would be accepted. Equal rights based on every rationale from poverty to race was employed in a desperate effort to spend money, public funds, to divert what was eventually going to become a two tiered social system out of economic circumstances from reality. Now that an undergrad degree in anything is well on the way to becoming a requirement for fast food counter employment, most of America is adjusting to what will be a lower standard of living for many folks. So what's the political difference if they're kept occupied with what they're being told will be their intellectual and economic saving grace or telling them that they're not getting a useful education?

I think we have all long been aware of the decline in the quality of education for a purely curriculum driven standpoint. When businesses started hiring college grads for positions that traditionally did not require one simply so they could insure that the applicant could read and perform arithmetic at an 8th grade level, that should have clued most into the declining standard as far as bulk of knowledge obtained goes. I was unaware that the definition of ""fact"" had changed from an academic standpoint from something that could be proven to merely something that has been written. It would appear from the recent conversation that the current crop of students is so well indoctrinated in the new order of things that they fail to grasp the circular logic involved. It is a fact because it is in the book, and we have proof that it is a fact because.........it is in the book. Somebody with a word processor and a linguistic gift could elevate themselves to the level of god. Froma purely practical standpoint, I suppose it doesn't matter what you tell them. It seems that the new educational system is certain to prove to be useful in the future, since it is likely to include massive poverty and a two tier socail system. Teaching them not to think, to shut up and believe what they are told to believe certainly has its benifits if you are the guy in charge of keeping the unwashed masses in the gutter where they belong.

I have noticed that our new line of engineers has to a large degree lost the ability to apply that knowledge in anything resembeling a unique or original design concept. I have an engineer that works for me that is nearly 70 years old. I have no idea why he is still working (could have soemthing to do with the fact that I am paying him a small fortune). I cannot count the numebr of times that the bean counters have sent a project back to enginnering with instructions that $20 thousand needs to be cut. The engineering team rarely meets that goal, usually cutting 1/4 of what is needed and returning it with a note ""that is all we can cut"". The project invariably goes to Sid (old guy), and he always seems to be able to exceed the orginal goal. sid does nto posess as much bulk knowledge as most of the younger guys do, but he is an ENGINEER, as opposed to a calculator attached to an autocad machine. After my ongoing conversation on this thread, I thing that this may be becsuase they have been taught to stay within the MAINSTREAM and not to question things. This, of course means that you are just doing what everybody else is doing, and if you could get ahead just doing what everybody else was doing, everybody else would already be a millionaire.

He asked the other day how I make my short term picks. He said mine were much better than his. I told him ""I just look at the candlesticks and try to decide what people are thinking"". The blank stare told me right away that he had no idea what I was talking about. He knew what a candlestick chart was, but not how to use the information provided to make reasonable decisions based on the provided data. This guy majored in business with a minor in economics! While this certainly shows that any idiot in America should be able to make money if they are willing to think even mariginally outside the box and take even minimal risks, I certainly does not say a whole lot about our educational system. I think a full generation is rather optomistic. Too many Americans have a negative net worth.","political-stance-helps-country-more","10:46 AM","government-debates","154"

The short term, desired effect of generally poor quality of education, from the perspective of a callous capitalist, is to build a citizenry capable of accepting government direction without question. If textbook matter is controlled by federal funding including direct school grants and individual scholastic loans for 'higher' education, it becomes a matter of fact that education will be to prevailing government standards, always substandard due to political necessity, without regard to practical application. The long-term problem is having a populace unable to relate to anything but what is/was in their mediocre textbooks and unfounded personal esteem, being mentored by instructors with that same lack of personal responsibility. In a declining economy, and maybe someone else sees recovery to our former, superior level of prosperity but I don't, the government is going to end up caring for a large population devoid of common sense and practical skills. It'll take a generation for those unable to generate their own wealth to go through what meager assets they inherit from lower and middle-class parentage immersed in personal and public debt. At that point, which we're already beginning to see, we'll experience the wealthy, a new middle class of government employees, and the have-nots. With that number of people being supported by public funds, the only major issue becomes how long we can afford to support them when 50% of annual budget is being spent on military expenditures and crusades.

A good friend of mine from high school developed an idea for a product in the machine tool industry. When he started out, we were manufaturing it for him on a fairly small scale using our excess capacity. He grew beyond waht we could provide (mine is basically a prototyping and short run production company, we are not set up for large scale production) and switched to a custom manufacturing company, American based, for supply. Roughly 6 months into the venture, he was approached by a representative of a chinese company who announced that they planned to manufacture an identical item. He basically blackmailed the guy. He was given the choice of either purchasing the units from the chinese company, or being driven out of business by the competition (since the chinese companies wholesale price for the item at about half the price that he was paying his manufaturer). The representative had all the research needed to make an informed decision. He had sales estimates, supply channel details, and even itemised estimates of what it would cost to defend the patent should my buddy make a foolish choice (their estimate was in the $500,000.00 range, which I think was probably a little low). He, like JP, was adamant that he woudl not carry a foreign product, and counted on the fact that his product was American made as his saving grace. The month that the imported item came on the market, his sales dropped by over 90%. He organised for a patent defense, and lost everything trying to defend his patent. He is now a salesman for a (ironically enough) german toolmaker. His concept was good, and in the six months beteen the time he went to market and lost the market, he made quite a bit of money. In the end he could not compete because his manufaturer was forced to pay higher wages (by several orders of magnitude), and higher prices for hisa raw materials than the competition. Polls show that over 80% of Americans say they are willing to pay a higher price for an American made product. When it comes time to actually put their money where their mouth is they prove themselves to be less than honest about this. I am not being critical of your plan, JP, I am just wondering how you account for such things (fishing for some free tips).","political-stance-helps-country-more","08:06 PM","government-debates","162"

The products that we're making are made on a machine that would cost $Millions to duplicate. For a niche market, I don't think there'd be many Chinese investors wanting to clone the output for such a small market. If the products become highly desirable, we'll practice ""continuous improvements"" and keep them at least a generation behind. Also, the racing community isn't like the general consumer market. There is a high degree of brand loyalty towards products that work and cost is a minor factor. For the ""tuner market"", that's another story. There you have to strike while the iron's hot and go on to something else. I have some ideas about combining several product/services in a bundle and selling the package. Since at least one of the parts of the bundle involves installation, that immediately eliminates foreign competition. If I don't sell the product separate from the installation, they'll have to clone the product AND set up local installation sites.
