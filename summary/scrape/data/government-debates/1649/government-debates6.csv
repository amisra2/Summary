Mature discussion consists, or should, of an exchange of learned opinions. Every formal debate and civilized conversation consists of a statement and if disputed, the challenger provides an opposing opinion with appropriate references, allowing the original speaker to respond in kind or gracefully stand corrected. All technical forums I frequent also follow that format. Being knowledgeable of all facets of a subject is what makes for interesting, opposing viewpoints. Being a devil's advocate also requires that position. Knowing only one side of any subject provides dull, prove it, one-sided exchanges. Those too lazy or lacking knowledge to dispute a statement with contrary facts are readily available in most public bars, on school playgrounds and from the always plentiful street corner oracles. And the aforementioned classrooms.","political-stance-helps-country-more","07:25 PM","government-debates","76"
"01-26-2005","1649",6,"Tigerlilly","None","He is saying that the 18th century and 19th century wasn't bad for many people and that charities were successful. I ask him to provide proof to counter textbooks and most academic articles published which say the opposite. He has yet to provide a credible academic source which says that the Libertarian Lassez fair system of the period prevented and effectively alleviated the mass poverty described in historical texts.","Dzeron","88400","I wouldn't call the system of the 18-19th century libertarian or laissez-faire. Remember, they had slavery up until 1864. Public, compulsory education has existed since the early 1800s. The government gave grants to railroads, refused to legalize labor unions, imposed tariffs, and did lots of other corporate-statist things. That isn't libertarian.","political-stance-helps-country-more","09:03 PM","government-debates","78"
"01-26-2005","1649",6,"Tigerlilly","None","Untill the government stepped in, the 18th and 19th century socio-economic philosophy was largely laissez fair, which is what Libertarians support. It was that way in Europe, especially, untill the advent of socialism after the industrial revolution started to show problems with the system. The industrial revolution began in the late 18th century and contiuned on into the 19th century. Compuslory ""mass"" education was a socialist product of that which was made in response to the growing animosity between classes and the desire to created an educated voting base, because private educations were expensive and isolated. REad Howard Zinn's: A people's history of the UNited STates. Ayn Rand also likes to praise the 18th -19th century laissez fair system.","pnac=ww3","88408","Thank god for socialist education!

That's what conservatives support. The libertarians support a version of capitalism where the state legalizes much more exits from poverty than in conservatism. It is, therefore, much more egalitarian than the state capitalism of the past. There is an even more egalitarian faction of the Libertarian Party called the Thomas Paine Caucus, which advocates limitations on the power of landlords.","political-stance-helps-country-more","09:22 PM","government-debates","81"
"01-27-2005","1649",6,"Tigerlilly","None","Show source and proof. Charities from private organizations don't provide more money than taxation. Yet again, no credible source shown. In the 19th and 18th century libertarian philosophies, without socialism mixed in, it was far better and cheaper and ""more efficient' economically just to fire non-skilled workers and the poor instead of providing anything for them. Get hurt? oh well, bye bye. Can't afford healthcare? OH well, bye bye? Aren't there any prisons? Aren't there any work camps? If you are lucky, a church might give you some scraps. This country needs many of the socialist decisions added through history. The only system didn't work normatively, therefore it was changed. No. It relies on charity for federal programs instead of taxation. The Badnarik Libertarian platform called for getting rid of many programs and replacing them with private charitible agencies, which is ludicrous. Economic efficiency isn't normative socially. Nope kid. You provided information without posting the document and the source, therefore you are making the statement, therefore it's your responsibility bubba, not mine. You make the postive and give ""information"", you must include the source. Burden of proof. It is not the responsibility of anyone in any case to refute what you say. YOu need to prove it. If you're too lazy to show your source and quote, then your concession is accepted. Postive statement + evidence = provide proof and source. You haven't done that. YOu expect people to go and believe you based on ""faith."" Duh ya think? Charities don't give as much money and help as many people as the government? Swell analysis. People don't donate nearly as much as is needed and that the Fed's can offer because they are lazy and greedy and people naturally don't give a **** until, they are forced to give a ****. Yes. I know about marginal analsys and opportunity cost. It's all quite irrelevant to the fact that people will not donate enough money. The didn't prior, and they won't now, and they won't in the future when you regress back to the level of 18th 19th century. And you cannot help the poor the way tha tis needed through small private charities. Government needs to cute the fat an stop pork barreling and use more efficiency. YOu don't have to get EVERYONE and you don't have to spend on all projects, but choose wisely. Not everyone needs to be protected. You help as many as you can without destroying the economy. Taxation is important. Conservatives in the government can't manage their spending. They spend on pointless projects, cut taxes, and then go to war. That's another problem. You are actually quite wrong. In a debate, the person making the statement to be challenged: ""there was no proverty problem"" or ""times were socially and economically good becaues of libertarian philosophy"" is the one who has to show sources. The questioner doesn't have to do anything. The burden is on the person making the statement of truth. No sources = personal opinion and faith-based evidence. I am not doing the homework for the positive side. THere are MANY sources which show the opposite in19th and 18th century life. nd focuses quite heavily on the industrial poverty of the late 18th and 19th centuries that was exacerbated by libertarian economic ideology and lassez fair policies. I cannot access his magical sources, becaues most of them are amorphous, non cited. You make the statement, you provide the direct source that's easily accessible or directly quote/show from it.

The $241 billion number comes from the American Association of Fundraising Counsel. Article at http://www.aafrc.org/press_releases/...icansgive.html Now, calculate 241 billion to the tenth power. Go to ""start""->programs->accessories->calculator. enter 240000000000 x^y 10 ""="" Yes, Badnarack plan called for replacing governmetn charity programs with private ones. It also called for strengthening our industrial infrastructure, which would provide millions of good paying production jobs. The libertarian formula relies on the fact that in a capitolist society, not only are prices based on the principals of supply and demand, so is labor. Maybe you can show me an example of a capitolistic economy where there was a large job surplus and poverty was a problem, or unemployment was a problem. During the 17th and 18th centuries in America, employers certianly had the option of simply dismissing their labor force. They didn't do it, though, because with such a massive labor shortage (due to the rapidly growing economy) that to do so would have been to cut their own throat. Since the government was only spendiung about 5% of our GDP, and the labor wagesw ere based ona labor shortage, people bought their own health care. It was not until WWII and the wage caps that came with it that companies started providieng healt benifits for their people (as a way around the wage caps). Then, people decided that there is no reason that those who have not worked for their health care should be deprived of it, so we ended up with governemtn healt care programs and all the inefficiencies that came with it. Sorry, if you want to refute, it is your responsibility to do so, THEN, I come back and spank you with my sources. Thats the way it works in about any debating situation. thi is not a classroom, it is a debate. It certianly sounds like you are having trouble finding data with which to refute. Here are a couple of places you can start: http://www.lib.umich.edu/govdocs/stats.html http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/colle...ts/histcensus/ The second is a census browser for old census data. Maybe you can find poverty numbers for the 17th and 18th century that support your claims (though you cannot, since the data was not even kept). OR, it could be that if the governemtn was not spending over 50% of our GDP on all levels, including regualtory costs and debt service, there would be more money in our pockets, which would almost certianly lead to higher charitable contributions. No, it is not. You would make a good politician.....just throw money at the problem until it goes away. Maybe you could point us towards and efficient government, or an efficiantly run government program. I nhave not seen one to date, so am having trouble visualising one. The problem with this plan is that nobdy really seems to have aconcrete definition of ""pork"" or ""trimming the fat"". What programs would you cut? Which pograms are providing as little benifit to society as a whole as our social programs? Since it is already fairly well established that a strong, growing, productive economy is possibly the most effective way to combat poverty (i.e if there truly is a job for every person, you can effectively cut social programs and know with a farily large degree of confidence that anybody who is unemployed is simply lazy), doesn't it make more sense to cut the social programs and turn that money back over to industry as expansion capitol? I would argue that since social programs inevitably breed laziness, socail programs are the ""fat"" that we need to be trimming. Socail programs are detrimental to any economy. I have not seen a single economic system that spends massively on social programs that has suceeded in the long run. As spending on social programs goes up, there is less capitol available for expansion. In addition, when you make it profitable fro people to NOT work, only a fool would be out there working. So not only have you killed off your expansion capitol, you have effectively removed the lower end of your labor pool from consideration as well. No. You want to refute, do so. If not, you can concede the point. Then provide some (that would be you refuting). Keep in mind that we are discussing 18th and 19th century America, not europe (which is a whole different ballgame). No, I provide my analysis of the data which has been available to me. You refute, then I come back and proe my statements (or, more properly, disprove yours). The problem here seems to be that you lack the sources to launch a proper counter. If that is the case, you concede graciously, you don't start bawling ""prove it"" like a child on a playground. If this was a magazine article, or an academic research paper, you would be correct, in the name of propreity, everything would need to be cited and we would need (ugh) footnotes. This is not an academic paper. It is a debate. Sniveling does not score any points.","political-stance-helps-country-more","05:26 AM","government-debates","83"
"01-27-2005","1649",6,"Tigerlilly","None","it doesn't matter what setting it is. In any debate setting, you have what it called the Burdeon of Proof. That burden of proof rests on the individual saying anything that can be proven. He must , when asked, provide the evidence. For example: A 303 engine has massive torque? Does it? Prove it. Man then goes online or cites a quote from a book or academic journal and then proves it. He doesn't spout off an opinion and statistics with no source attatched. NO one can verifiy it. The challenger doesn't have to provide an oposing opinion untill the facts are proven through sources and those sources are visible. After that, THEN the challenger can post his opinion, and the challener must provide all sources used. Asking for proof isn't childish or lazy. It's called following debate logic. IT doesn't work that you just say whateve ryou want and expect peopel to hunt down refutation material. That's not how a debate goes. that is lazy, but on behalf of the person making a statement.","daewoo","88429","No, you refute, then I come back and beat you to death with a hammer that has ""the real world"" written on it. No, a 303 is a reworked 327. It is a short stroke engine. Even Chevys modern offering (in the monte carlo) only has 323 ft lbs of torque! Torque is a fanction of displacement and stroke length. While 323 ft lbs of torque is certainly respectable, the modern 350 puts out 389 ft lbs, and the V-10 puts out over 425! these are all right off of chevys spec sheets, which are available at their web page. See how it is done? Here is her problem. She can't find any sources with which to refute, so she is hoping to use mine, or attack their validity. This is why it is the responsibilty of the other party to refute. Yea, it is pretty much childish and lazy. If you want to refute the point, you hunt down material with which to do it. If you can't find any, or don't have eny, you concede graciously, hopefully having learned something.","political-stance-helps-country-more","05:45 AM","government-debates","84"

God, mental levitation, etc. require burden of proof for opening statement, all of which are circular arguments having no factual basis. Personal belief. In a true debate no materials, reference books, websites, etc. are allowed. All debaters must use their retained knowledge of the subject or face default. That's the object of debate, learned opinions exchanging viewpoints. Otherwise it's just a couple or group of people passing information on a one-sided basis with the knowledgeable party(s) providing a learning session for others. As children our family was raised with 'If you don't know what you're talking about in a social setting, keep your mouth shut'. If we were curious enough about something, we asked questions of our parents, school teachers and peer group outside the social setting. At that point if our curiosity was strong enough, we were provided the information those parties had available and instructed on how to glean additional information on a subject. That's how personal and often professional interests are developed. Sating curiosity or understanding anything new is an educational process, not debate.","political-stance-helps-country-more","09:09 AM","government-debates","86"

To my mind, especially when dealing with economic matters, either your position is grounded in logic and has been shown historically to work, or it is not. If it is not, you change your position. Money has no friends and no loyalties. I have mentioned here before that I am a partner in an on line currency trading enterprise. It was amazing to me how many of our American subscribers ended up bankrupting their accounts 4th quarter last year because despite the fact that the dollar had been free falling for some time, they continued to go short on the euro and cable medium and long term.

That phrase ordinarily passed as they eventually recognized the reality of living in a capitalistic society versus the cost of socialism. At least in the US, I can't help but feel our overwhelming government pursuit of equality for votes will adversely dilute our quality of education at the university level. There are people who will not benefit from higher education in a manner that improves society simply because higher education is now presented as a social necessity, not a personal decision. Under those circumstances the tradition of opening one's mind will rapidly be replaced by layers of learn by rote information without the ability to assimilate, examine and reach rational conclusions. In general, we're going to put some superficial, technical polish on a lot of what will remain dogmatic brains loyal to formative age peer knowledge.
