Personally, I think that many conservatives are more idealistic and unrealistic. Generally, conservatives seem to be in favor of less federal government involvement in things. This often seems to manifests itself in the idea that corporations can regulate themselves, and be fair to their workers and the environment (something I think is unrealistic and idealistic) and that states can be trusted to do what is right for their people. (Also, I believe, this is often unrealistic and idealisitc as shown by the south's attitude to segration.) Don't get me wrong, I love the idea that corporations can be trusted, and that states should be allowed to govern themselves, but history just does not seem to indicate this is true. I like states and corporations to have freedom, but to think that there is no need for any kind of oversight is, I think, idealistic, and unrealistic.","political-stance-helps-country-more","03:59 PM","government-debates","16"

Regarding big government: liberals are big government in your wallet, conservatives are big government in your bedroom. I think the only political party that is truly small government is liberterian (not one, myself). To answer the initial question though - I think we would be limping and useless without the great diversity or thought, ideas and opinions we have here. I think the lack of those things is one of the main reasons totalitarian governments fail.","political-stance-helps-country-more","08:00 PM","government-debates","17"
"03-28-2004","1649",2,"Phunting","None","Not entirely. I see the view over drugs and sexual abstinence held by many of the right to be ridiculously idealistic. But you are correct, you need both wings to fly...","Ghost","41389","Yeah, the right normally encompasses the majority of Christians in this country, and they do have some ridiculous views about sex..drugs I dunno, I have objections to them, especially serious ones. But the paranoia they hold about things like this is pretty funny. As far as sex goes, the Buddhists have it right. You do need both philosophies in a country to have it run effectively, if you have either one in total control you're going to have problems.","political-stance-helps-country-more","06:08 PM","government-debates","18"

The real issue should not be ""what ideology is better?"", for they are both contraining and divisive. What is necessary is a government unshackled from ideology so as to be flexible and diverse enough to handle the varying situations a State encounters. Any government bound by an ideology, be it ""conservative"" or ""liberal"" <those vague terms which mean little anyway> is doomed to incrementalism and stagnation.","political-stance-helps-country-more","03:50 PM","government-debates","23"

During the civil rights movement, Dr. King dreamed of a color-blind society. A society ""that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character"". The goal is to have all men equal. It is not to support a person because of the color of their skin. We now live in a nation in which schools prefer minorities over the majority, in which the best and the brightest are not chosen simply because of their skin. If we lived in a 100% right-wing country, I can guarentee you that it would truly be color blind. With no racial quotas for television networks to fill.","political-stance-helps-country-more","08:51 PM","government-debates","24"

I do apologize, I didn't mean a 100% right wing, what I truly was thinking of was a 100% fair and equal country. It seems to me that our country is at a turning point, the progressive aims have been over-achieved and now we need to get back to a balance. The next logical step that our country should take is trying to convince other countries to adopt our views. Things like womens rights can only be taken so far, the line was crossed a few years ago with Roe vs Wade, which made the killing of the weakest members of society legal. Somewhat similar to a cooling graph, the liquid of society supercools past the line and then stabilizes. Civil rights can be taken too far, but then again so can control. I would like to finish saying that we are near an equilibrium in our country, but a few of the civil rights issues that end up hurting people need to be corrected.","political-stance-helps-country-more","08:48 PM","government-debates","26"

It was a part of the national socialistic (nazi) ideology.

Firstly, why would he? I mean, it is apparant that there where many who had faith in the nazi ideology at the time. Why would Hitler be different from all of those with ""true"" faith? Secondly, Hitler also went out of his way to achieve certain objectives without any apparant gain other than fullfilling his ideological goals. The fact that the holocaust was a secret before the end of the war ought to disaprove the notion that his actions where based on some power maximizing strategy. Thirdly, after having read Mein Kampf (My struggle) I find it very hard to believe that someone would actually write that **** without believing it himself...","political-stance-helps-country-more","05:57 PM","government-debates","30"
