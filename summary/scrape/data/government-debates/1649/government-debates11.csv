I have noticed that our new line of engineers has to a large degree lost the ability to apply that knowledge in anything resembeling a unique or original design concept. I have an engineer that works for me that is nearly 70 years old. I have no idea why he is still working (could have soemthing to do with the fact that I am paying him a small fortune). I cannot count the numebr of times that the bean counters have sent a project back to enginnering with instructions that $20 thousand needs to be cut. The engineering team rarely meets that goal, usually cutting 1/4 of what is needed and returning it with a note ""that is all we can cut"". The project invariably goes to Sid (old guy), and he always seems to be able to exceed the orginal goal. sid does nto posess as much bulk knowledge as most of the younger guys do, but he is an ENGINEER, as opposed to a calculator attached to an autocad machine. After my ongoing conversation on this thread, I thing that this may be becsuase they have been taught to stay within the MAINSTREAM and not to question things. This, of course means that you are just doing what everybody else is doing, and if you could get ahead just doing what everybody else was doing, everybody else would already be a millionaire. The thought of loosing Sid scares the hell out of me. He may well be irreplacable. And you have just wrapped the whole problem up into a single short paragraph. I have already voiced my opinion regarding to blind faith in whatever bit of fluff happens to be in your textbook. Add the problem of lack of practical skills to the scale and you are looking at REAL problems. I have a brother in law who is a day trader (currencies and stocks). While I personally have no interest in this kind of thing (I am not intereseted in money making schemes that require that I be shackled to a computer), we do email back and forth about it fairly frequently (he is my wifes favorite brother, so I am willing to put forth some effort to ""play nice""). He asked the other day how I make my short term picks. He said mine were much better than his. I told him ""I just look at the candlesticks and try to decide what people are thinking"". The blank stare told me right away that he had no idea what I was talking about. He knew what a candlestick chart was, but not how to use the information provided to make reasonable decisions based on the provided data. This guy majored in business with a minor in economics! While this certainly shows that any idiot in America should be able to make money if they are willing to think even mariginally outside the box and take even minimal risks, I certainly does not say a whole lot about our educational system. I think a full generation is rather optomistic. Too many Americans have a negative net worth.","political-stance-helps-country-more","10:46 AM","government-debates","154"

A good friend of mine from high school developed an idea for a product in the machine tool industry. When he started out, we were manufaturing it for him on a fairly small scale using our excess capacity. He grew beyond waht we could provide (mine is basically a prototyping and short run production company, we are not set up for large scale production) and switched to a custom manufacturing company, American based, for supply. Roughly 6 months into the venture, he was approached by a representative of a chinese company who announced that they planned to manufacture an identical item. He basically blackmailed the guy. He was given the choice of either purchasing the units from the chinese company, or being driven out of business by the competition (since the chinese companies wholesale price for the item at about half the price that he was paying his manufaturer). The representative had all the research needed to make an informed decision. He had sales estimates, supply channel details, and even itemised estimates of what it would cost to defend the patent should my buddy make a foolish choice (their estimate was in the $500,000.00 range, which I think was probably a little low). He, like JP, was adamant that he woudl not carry a foreign product, and counted on the fact that his product was American made as his saving grace. The month that the imported item came on the market, his sales dropped by over 90%. He organised for a patent defense, and lost everything trying to defend his patent. He is now a salesman for a (ironically enough) german toolmaker. His concept was good, and in the six months beteen the time he went to market and lost the market, he made quite a bit of money. In the end he could not compete because his manufaturer was forced to pay higher wages (by several orders of magnitude), and higher prices for hisa raw materials than the competition. Polls show that over 80% of Americans say they are willing to pay a higher price for an American made product. When it comes time to actually put their money where their mouth is they prove themselves to be less than honest about this. I am not being critical of your plan, JP, I am just wondering how you account for such things (fishing for some free tips).","political-stance-helps-country-more","08:06 PM","government-debates","162"

Their business ethic is ""make money, screw everybody else"" It was a sad day for US industry when the chinese figured out they could trade limited access to their consumer market for technology. Japans drive for mechanization of their factories took 20 years. The chinese did it in 5, and Ford paid the lions share of the bill for it. Better get to market quick. In another 5 years, the chinese will dominate our high tech markets. Already they have taken over 40% of the consumer electronics market (largely due to sales through Wal Mart). Their other favorite trick seems to be providing manufatured products to be sold under an American label. Butler buildings are now mostly made in china. Not long ago I was at a place in kansas city called RSO (they sell salvaged freight) and they had 2 pallet of Crane cam shafts. Point of origin ont he shipping label was Beijing. It is getting to the point that everyting is like the automotive industry, where ""made in America"" is either very subjective or a downright farce. A Ford truck built in a canadian factory is an American car. A Toyoto built in Indiana is apparently not. I never would have believed that Crane was getting their cams from china had I not seen it myself (OR, they could have been chinese knockoffs....another of chinas favorite tricks).","political-stance-helps-country-more","08:33 PM","government-debates","163"

The products that we're making are made on a machine that would cost $Millions to duplicate. For a niche market, I don't think there'd be many Chinese investors wanting to clone the output for such a small market. If the products become highly desirable, we'll practice ""continuous improvements"" and keep them at least a generation behind. Also, the racing community isn't like the general consumer market. There is a high degree of brand loyalty towards products that work and cost is a minor factor. For the ""tuner market"", that's another story. There you have to strike while the iron's hot and go on to something else. I have some ideas about combining several product/services in a bundle and selling the package. Since at least one of the parts of the bundle involves installation, that immediately eliminates foreign competition. If I don't sell the product separate from the installation, they'll have to clone the product AND set up local installation sites. Since some of the technology will be patented, if they do establish domestic installation sites, they'll be US targets for infringement and not foreign targets.","political-stance-helps-country-more","08:31 AM","government-debates","164"

It took them a couple of years to understand the market applications, but quality is now indistinguishable from US finish work. Needless to say, no performance cranks are forged in the US. Even Ford Performance has purchased blanks from Germany for years. Crower and those few independents still left are basically job shops servicing a limited niche market. Loyalty in the domestic automotive aftermarket is still mostly branded names, but many other than Edelbrock and a couple of others who dominate markets have gone to off-shore sources to retain their name and market share. My brother manufactures safety devices and he went to Taiwan in 1991 to close his production here. The actual production was Chinese, but at that time US sentiment for commercial products was still Made in the USA union dominated. He did final assembly here with minimum wage help until 1995, and by then our economy was struggling to the point where price was king and country of origin was no longer a factor. He now employs only minimum wage warehouse shipping and receiving people, an office staff for billing and customer service and has an outside company do his accounting, probably in India, but he doesn't know as it comes to his controller from a US namesake. His next step is drop shipments from China to his major distributors but they're still mostly in the process of attempting to survive and unable to cope with major changes in their business methodology.","political-stance-helps-country-more","09:44 AM","government-debates","165"
