One of the few places where I will allow the idea of government intervention is in education and training. If someone has to depend on minium wage to live, then they also need additional assistance to get further training to move beyond the minium wage job. Minium wage needs to be tied to further job training. Minium wage makes liberals feel like that are really assisting poor people with a minium amount of effort.","minimum-wage","10:24 PM","government-debates","7"

What and you think that if minimum wage is abolished that all the ""conservatives"" would increase the average without a minimum wage? What kind of sense does that make? Minimum wage is not a requirement, this is key...people can pay more if they want to. But they don't, they pay the bare minimum, why?, because they are greedy. What happens if there is no minimum, it goes as low as the business can get some poor idiot to work for. You statement is ludicrous.","minimum-wage","11:21 PM","government-debates","8"

Employment of low skilled (and often young) males dropped 5%...7% for females. -The 1978 Congressional Minimum Wage Study Commisson concluded that for every 10% increase in the min wage, 1-3% of low skilled workers would be barred from employment, or lose their jobs. -A 1995 study at the University of Wisconsin concluded that in states with an increase in minimum wage, low skilled working mothers tended to stay on welfare for an average of 44% longer than in those states without the increase. -A 1995 study at Michigan State University concluded that higher skilled teens (or those often perceived to be more ""desirable"", such as white teens) displaced lower skilled or less ""desirable"" teens by as much as 20% after a minimum wage hike. -A 1992 study of New Jersey's employment rate after their min wage hike found that employment declined 4%, compared to neighboring Pennsylvania's employment rate, which remained stable. -A 1988 study by the Council of Economic Advisors concluded that the increase in federal min wage would result in job losses for minorty, low skilled, and younger workers. -A 2001 study at Ohio University shows that because of inefficient targeting of the poor and unintended adverse consequences on employment and earnings, min wage laws are ineffective as an antipoverty device. -A 2000 study out of John Hopkins University concluded that *the proposed federal min wage hikes would harm low skilled and minority teen workers. -A 2001 study out of Ohio State University concluded that there*is no statistically significant negative relationship between the minimum wage and a lowering of*poverty. I could go on. The simple fact of the matter is that the min wage hurts low skilled workers (that is, workers whos marginal revenue product is below the set min) and does nothing for the rest of us. I mean, the DOE determined that 38% of people on welfare are functionally illiterate. Four out of ten welfare recipients couldnt perform simple quantitative tasks, such as making change. How can we expect these people, who produce next to nothing, to find a job at $5.75 an hour? -GFA","minimum-wage","02:36 PM","government-debates","20"

Therefore, what minimum wage esablishes is how much the companies pay X. And that money, in turn, comes out of the profits paid to the executive. It won't come out of firing more workers, because then the company would fall below X and be unable to operate, and repealing min. wage would not cause more hirings, because the company has no reason to hire more than X.","minimum-wage","05:11 PM","government-debates","28"

(or possibly both.) In order to expand, it will need to hire more than X number of workers. When the companies success is diminished, it will then eliminate a portion of the expansion and lay off some of those extra workers that it took on. With the situation you described, if a company laid off people, it would automatically have to shut its doors.","minimum-wage","09:09 PM","government-debates","29"
