Let's say Mr. A wanted anyother employee but could no aford to pay the minimum wage. And Mr. B was a homeless person who would work for less than minimum wage. Should the government prohibit Mr. A from hiring Mr. B?","minimum-wage","12:26 AM","government-debates","2"

In the real world employers would take advantage of the desperation of the man you speak of. See how close they could get him to working for nothing.

One of the few places where I will allow the idea of government intervention is in education and training. If someone has to depend on minium wage to live, then they also need additional assistance to get further training to move beyond the minium wage job. Minium wage needs to be tied to further job training. Minium wage makes liberals feel like that are really assisting poor people with a minium amount of effort.","minimum-wage","10:24 PM","government-debates","7"

What and you think that if minimum wage is abolished that all the ""conservatives"" would increase the average without a minimum wage? What kind of sense does that make? Minimum wage is not a requirement, this is key...people can pay more if they want to. But they don't, they pay the bare minimum, why?, because they are greedy. What happens if there is no minimum, it goes as low as the business can get some poor idiot to work for. You statement is ludicrous.","minimum-wage","11:21 PM","government-debates","8"
