I was wondering if any of them can back this accusation up with facts. If you look at the definition of empire, I think you will find that this does not accurately describe the position of the United States. Furthermore, the U.S. was never really competitive in the 19th-20th century race to colonize third world countries. What facts support your claim that America is an empire and/or a colonist? Empire: a major political unit having a territory of great extent or a number of territories or people under a single soveriegn authority; esp: one having an emperor as chief of state. (Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 10th Edition) Colonialism: control by one power over a dependent area or people (Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 10th Edition) Please give me your version of why the U.S. is considered by you to be an empire. Give historic facts that back your position if necessary. Is the left's attempt to reclassify the United States another example of them misrepresenting the facts? Do the communists have a version of history distorted enough to rival Karl Marx or Noam Chomsky?","u-s-imperialism","12:10 AM","government-debates","1"

It failed because it was still a totally amateur sport, and the rising American Football had more money. In similar fashion it split in Australia and the UK, with a professional form, Rugby League emerging. Rugby Union has only just gone fully professional in the last decade.

"09-23-2003","175",1,"mizmaxx","None","So, anyway, back to the topic... Well, I'm not a ""communist"", but I do recognize the US as an imperialist state. The US was not part of the European ""race"" for the colonization of Africa, Asia and Australia because it was busy colonizing the US. They called it ""how the West was won"". The US is a former British colony whose colonists decided to finish the job alone from where they were. That's the only difference between the US and, say, South Africa. The reason they could do this was because of the ""luck"" of the effectiveness of the use of biological war against the First Nations- through smallpox mostly. Thus, wereas most other colonized areas remained populated by indigenous peoples, the American invaders were able to push the indigenous population further and further west until they almost completely eradicated them. This combined with the desire for land fueled by British industrialisation and the concomitant push of peasants off their land into crappy city jobs and squalor, created America. Of course, colonisation must keep on going, the empire must grow, so there was Mexico, Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico. It was during this time that people started to revolt in large numbers globally, and the powers that be recognized that they would have to try something different. So instead of explicit colonialism through political colonies, the US simply threatens or attacks with their sizeable army anyone whose resources appeal to them, and sets up a military presence to make sure it continues. As they say, the truth is out there....","montalban","16868","Sorry, but I get carried away when it comes to talking footy. (that's football) Politically, I'm a socialist.* I thought I'd just announce that as we're into confession mode. The USA is an imperial power. However it decided to rule by the cheap means; economy. So, in China for example, in the 1800s, when it was impossible with it to compete with Britain, it called for an 'open-door' policy. It wanted 'free trade' because it couldn't afford to colonise parts of China. Britain claimed zones of 'influence' in China, but it too didn't have the resources to annex big slabs of land. So in part it supported this 'open-door' policy. So American seemingly benign stance was based on politico-economic realities When the USA could take something cheaply, they did, orchestrating a war with light-weights such as Spain. It annexed Hawaii, which was almost an independent kingdom. It waited till the last moment to join in WWI. It sat by while the democracies, Britain and France were being hacked to death by Nazi Germany. American culture rules supreme too. I live in a small nation (by population standards). We are aware of what happens in the USA, with baseball, gridiron, basketball etc. You'd never have heard of Rugby Union - which we're world champions of. Cricket, as well. I'm not complaining, just stating a fact. You guys are the rule by which most people are either trying to live by, or react against. *Religiously I'm ultra-conservative. I believe Jesus was a socialist, and will follow Him. It may explain a bit of schizoid behaviour. It's also why I'm so argumentative, because I disagree with people on either one, or the other front.","u-s-imperialism","06:14 AM","government-debates","14"
"09-23-2003","175",1,"None","None","None","AMD4EVER","16919","The US isn't as imperialistic as it could be. I hope you will at least grant us that. In our past we have tried to expand our area of control as much as possible while other powerful countries were grasping at areas of land around the world. Most of this expansion has ended and now it would seem that economics are where the US influence is spreading. Even our culture has begun to spread across the world as has our language and people. We are buying control and using our economic power to attain more economic power. We have used our technology as well to gain power. One shocking example of this is that much of Europe is dependent on our GPS system in ways pertaining to their military and we could theoretically block GPS signals to them at any time. So I'll go as far as to say that the US is always going to look to expand it's influence on the rest of the world, but we could go much further than this. Our military strength is a bargaining tool and our political connections would allow us to forum quite a powerful army if indeed we wished to do so. I don't doubt that the US with the support of Russia or China or NATO or the UN could take control of much of the world through force. I don't doubt that had Germany/Japan or Russia/China become the superpowers that the threat of force could have been the most dominant way of expanding areas of control. Although I doubt that every country is happy to see the US gaining more influence and control in the world through the use of politics, technology, and economy, I don't think they would be any happier with many of the other superpowers that could have taken the US's place.","u-s-imperialism","01:30 PM","government-debates","15"

No, the rest of the world (as well as many US people) are NOT ""happy"" to see little US flags on the bombs dropping on their houses and the guns being used to shoot their babies. The argument ""someone else might be doing it if it weren't us"" is no excuse. It's an absurd moral argument. I could just shoot you, because if I don't someone else will, just look at the murder rates in the US! AT any rate, the question was US=Imperialist? Unequivocally yes.","AMD4EVER","17304","I think they were a little more than just colder. Against who? Have we used a threat of force against sensible country lately? Iraq wasn't sensible nor is Iran, Afghanistan, or North Korea. We use politics, technology, and the economy to expand our influence, not force. If we wanted to use force then surely our borders would be rapidly changing. That is not the case. Nor is the world ever happy to see anyones flag on a bomb that will drop on their homes. The US + UN sees to it that the countries who are becoming a threat to the world are kept under control. Neither the US or UN just randomly says hey lets attack this country today. Weak indeed but a good point nonetheless. The US will one day not be the strongest country in the world. It is likely that China will surpass us one day just as the EU may do so as well if they can get their act together. I would give it maybe 20 more years before the US isn't considered the only superpower in the world. Do you think that the future is brighter because of this? Will the next superpower be less focused on spreading their influence? I already agreed with this. The point I'm trying to make is that you have to keep it in perspective. The previous superpowers of the world tried to expand their influence just as the current ones do and the future ones will too. That is what you get for being a world leader.","u-s-imperialism","01:37 PM","government-debates","19"

It is in fact an imperialist myth, thank you very much, to say that you saved us. American involvement in WWII did not begin in 1939, when we went to war. It didn't despite your commitment to aid China (attacked since 1933). You intervened in your own national interest. IF you saved us, it was in your national interest - in an effort to have a strong supply base to strike back at Japan. Let's settle the record. When Japan entered the war, most of our forces were overseas fighting against the Germans and Italians in North Africa. Our Prime Minister, John Curtin wanted to withdraw out troops to defend our own country. This became more critical when the Japanese had very early successes in Singapore and the Philippines. ""Winston Churchill wanted these troops to be diverted to Burma to stop the Japanese from invading India ""Backed unanimously by War Cabinet and caucus, Curtin followed the formal advice. He had no doubts and days and nights of bitter cable exchanges with Churchill followed. President Roosevelt was also bringing pressure to bear. Parliament met twice in secret session. The last straw was Churchill ordering the 7th Division to turn north for Burma, but he had to give way after no fewer than four staunch Australian protests. Curtin played a pivotal role in changing Australia from a nation with an inward perspective, regarding itself as a colonial satellite of Great Britain which sided automatically with the Mother country, to a nation with a more international outlook capable and prepared to make its own decisions. By standing up to Churchill, he ensured that Australia's interests were not overridden by Britain's."" http://john.curtin.edu.au/resources/...y/details.html Roosevelt wanted Australia's troops, not to defend our own country, but to defend India (which both he and Churchill believed was more important than Australia). ""One could conclude that Curtin's place in Australian history is on a spur to the main path of advance. He stood up to Roosevelt and Churchill and saved Australian troops of the 7th Division from joining the 8th in Japanese prisoner of war camps, their almost certain fate if committed to Burma without air support or sea control, and under British command. He put Australia on a total war footing. He became the central figure in one of our most affecting stories. But he did not fight the Battle of Australia because it never took place, he did not ""save"" Australia from a Japanese attack which was always unlikely and soon impossible, and he did not take part in the key strategic decisions of the Pacific war. As a war lord Curtin was not in the class of Churchill or Roosevelt."" http://john.curtin.edu.au/events/speeches/edwardsj.html Our war effort was not as mighty as the USA's, however in your national interest, you at first wanted to abandon Australia! Then when Curtin stood up to you you made plans on how to then best carry out the war, from Australia. However, even then, excepting for your navy, your army still had to be raised - and many of the soldiers were ear-marked not for the Pacific, but for Britain. ""During 1942, US forces in Australia steadily increased in number, but did not exceed Australian forces until 1943. Until then, the country?s defence relied mainly on Australian efforts, reinforced by the occasional intervention of US naval forces from Hawaii."" http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/mee...eName=inoffice ""With their naval forces effectively defeated, the Japanese called off their planned capture of Port Moresby by sea. Instead they launched a land attack, across the Owen Stanley mountains. Establishing bases on the north coast of New Guinea, the Japanese forces began the assault on Port Moresby. MacArthur was slow to respond to this challenge, not believing a successful attack across the forbidding terrain was likely. But the Japanese soldiers captured Kokoda, and pushed on towards Port Moresby. At MacArthur?s urging, Curtin ordered the Australian army commander, General Thomas Blamey, to go to Port Moresby to take personal charge of its defence. Blamey arrived at Port Moresby in late September, in the middle of an eight-week Australian offensive on the Kokoda Trail. But the Japanese defeat at Milne Bay made their advance impossible, and the victory at Kokoda on 2 November 1942 marked the turning point in the southward sweep of the Japanese offensive. The Japanese commanders turned their attention to the Solomon Islands base of Guadalcanal."" (Ibid) So, even when we were allies, you were quite prepared to abandon us, because in the global scheme of things, 7million Australians were not as important as the wealth of supplies from India!

""The China Theatre of Operations more resembled the Soviet-German war on the Eastern Front than the war in the Pacific or the war in Western Europe. On the Asian continent, as on the Eastern Front, an Allied partner, China, carried the brunt of the fighting."" http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/brochures/72-38/72-38.htm You stated that America 'saved' Australia. As the Soviet Union took on more troops than the Americans ever did, it makes just as much sense as saying that the Soviet Union saved the United States. (using your logic).

As long as we maintain our standing as an economic power there is no real threat that can be posed to our government. The British empire collapsed because they were spread way too thin and couldn't really defend all their territories. The US is well covered as far as it's own population goes. There really is no rising threat in the internal population that is threatening the government. I just don't find it too realistic that the US will collapse from the inside out instead of the other way around. External forces are previlant in our globalized system especially in the case of economics. If another country becomes an economic power, such as China and India probably will, then they will pose an external threat to the US way of life. This may lead to a chain reaction that eventually collapses the US. Still I think it will take some major external pressure like this before the internal forces can even become important enough to threaten the US empire. However, because of globalization it is likely that the US and the next superpower(s) will be economically linked and will keep each other afloat as long as war doesn't break out. This attribute of globalization has been keeping stability in the worlds economic powers for years now and I wouldn't suspect that this will change in the future either. The US form of imperialism has been one that has both strengthend ourselves and has brought stability to the worlds strongest countries as well as increased stability in the third world countries. With the way that this system works it will either take a major world war or a major economic collapse before the US or any other major superpower could fall in my opinion.

None of the nations has been invaded by US troops since WWII (though Japan was 'occupied') Cambodia is not the best example I could have used. Cambodia was in an embryonic state - having gained independence from France, it never really got a chance to get its feet on the ground. Chile for instance had a democratically elected Socialist Government - which was thrown out in a US sponsored coup, so it is academic as to whether this government could have been sustained - it just never had a chance to show us. Nicaragua was fairly stable once the Sandanistas came to power in the early 1980s despite the USA's best efforts. I think however you implied that the world has been pretty much stable - and that this is a good thing. Saudi Arabia has been stable in the years I've looked at here. However, it is hardly a beacon for liberal ideals.

We are putting our fingers in the rapidly appearing holes in the dam, but we are running out of fingers. I do agree that North Korea is creating their own problem, and this would be easily fixed, but the problems faced by the US are multi-faceted and not quite so easy to remedy.

Korea is far more threatening to the rest of the world, including the US, than the rest of the world is to them.","AMD4EVER","19025","The US would need to face a Russian threat for it to be as great of a threat as North Korea is facing today. The US does have threats all over the place but no where near the level of threat that North Korea is facing. North Korea has the potenial to glow in the dark. The US doesn't face that much of a threat. Only Russia could actually accomplish such a thing unless we turned our nukes on ourselves. North Korea has the potential to drop to zero in population while the US doesn't. North Korea has the potential to lose a great percentage of their population while the US doesn't. The claim that North Korea is more of a threat to us than we are to them is correct in one way. It would be like an insane person being more of a risk to a 6'6 linebacker than the linebacker is to him since the linebacker cares if he gets hurt while the insane person doesn't. Therefore the insane person has less to lose and probably doesn't feel as threatened as the linebacker does. However, in reality the complete opposite is really true. If the insane person attacks he would likely be killed. So even as it may seem like the linebacker is more threatened and willing to avoid conflict than the insane person, the insane person is the only one risking death. The North Korean problem may be a short term one while the US problem may last for centuries. Still I would place my money on the US being around 50 years from now rather than North Korea based on not only recent events, but also based on South Korean and Japanise threats as well as their small size and big mouth. But I'm really not even focusing on the future threats as much as I am the short term threats.

"10-11-2003","175",4,"sundowner","None","And we don't? That is why we are closely monitoring N. Korea and Iran right now. We are not 100% positive that these nations do not already have nuclear weapons. What about the terrorists? It is possible that they could have ""pruchased"" nuclear weapons or the materials neccesary for nuclear weapons. We also have the potential to be attacked with chemical weapons or biological agents like Anthrax. You think the 5 people killed by the Anthrax attacks were bad, what would happen if Anthrax was introduced to the water supply, or detonated in a so called ""dirty bomb"" over a major population center. The fall out form biological agents could not only kill people for 100's of miles, but continue to kill people for years. We might be able to wipe them off the map, but you will see conventional war with N. Korea long before you ever see them glow...(not a bad idea though). Like those 19 insane terrorists on 9/11? The ones who died for their cause..and took 3000 innocent Americans with them? Like that? Or North Korea could continue to be a thorn in the side of the world as they have done since the 1950's. They could require monitoring and a sizealbe force of our military to watch them as they have done for 50+ years. As far as big mouth...you are absolutely correct, old Kimmy needs a muzzle and a haircut. As far as small, not quite. N. Korea has one of the largest armies in the world, and they could threaten many of our allies in a number of ways, like S. Korea, or Japan. Remember, we fought them once, yet the threat remains. Are we likely to lose today, probably not, but engaging in war with N. Korea is a huge risk to the US.","AMD4EVER","19053","Name one threat that could cover 10% of our territory with nuclear explosions? North Korea is facing the threat of having at least that done to them if they really do launch an attack on the US. Sure the US will feel like it lost more but logically the US will lose less than North Korea as North Korea will face the inevitable task of surrender and probably end up in US or South Korean hands. North Korea has the possibility of not existing. How can you argue that the US faces a greater threat than this in the short term? Either this is a weak argument or you are missing the point here. The point is that we are the linebacker and North Korea is the insane person. That sums up almost everything. You are saying ""But the US lost 3,000 people and look how upset that made them"" while I'm saying 3,000 is .00001% of our population and North Korea stands to lose a whole lot more than that percentage if their external stability fails. You are focusing on who will feel the most for their loss while I'm focusing on the numbers and percents and final outcomes. North Korea is clearly troubled by greater external threat than the US is even if they don't care about it as much as the US does. Don't you agree with this? North Korea will probably continue to be a thorn in our side and as long as that is true they will face great external instability. They are risking everything by threatening us and should they follow through we will be hurt but they will be dead. They are small in land size and that means a single nuke will destroy a greater percentage of their land than a single nuke will do to the US. This becomes a big deal in nuclear battles as does population and world connections. The US would have support in a nuclear conflict if attacked. North Korea is likely to be the one attacking so they would have little in the way of world connections. This also hurts them because they are too small to completely supply themselves and this can be shown based on their starving populations even while they recieve aid packages from the US and China. Small matters especially in nuclear conflict. As for their army they are a threat but they are not as threatening as their numbers would bear out. The country would be in so much chaos after a few nuclear strikes that I wouldn't expect them to be able to stand up to a US led attack and it could even be Iraq all over again. The chain of command would fail as poor communications and lack of supply + food + oil becomes and issue. A broken North Korea would crumble especially in the face of a very angry US led attack. Their military wouldn't be able to protect anything and would be best served to begin a gurilla war because they would fail in straight conflict. You prove my point when you bring up the Korean war. The North Koreans controlled almost the whole of Korea and we took almost EVERYTHING back. They had nothing except a sure defeat until the Chinese got involved. This is the world connection that the North Koreans lack. Sure China will support North Korea as long as they are being good. If you see the North march on Seoul or nuke Japan or, God forbid, Los Angeles, I would wager a guess that China will march on North Korea in response. China surely wouldn't support the North Koreans for being the aggressor nor did they do so in the Korean war. In short, North Korea faces external stability issues just as the US does. The problem for North Korea is that they cannot deal with the consequences of extreme instability while the US can. A few chemical and nuclear strikes on the US will hurt us. That is what the US faces in an extreme case. The force of a US led war against North Korea is what the North Koreans face in an extreme case. They would either be destroyed or lose control over their country. Having said all this I would like to ask this question of you again.

We do not control who attacks us, the terrorist regimes are not going to wait for us to do anything to them before they attack...as seen on 9/11, they will just attack us.

The one thing they have going for them is the fact that the US doesn't want a nuclear conflict. But should the US decide to go forward with this anyways they are the ones in control of how far this conflict will escalate. North Korea is in the hands of the US before and after war begins, that is not control. No one can put the US in this situation. The terrorists and terrorist supporters can only force the US to attack them, their homes, and way of life and await defeat. A nuclear attack against us will probably cause the fall of several countries while a nuclear attack against North Korea would cause the fall of their country. Also your note of no matter who the US makes friends with we will still have enemies can apply to every country. At least the US is in a great position to defend themselves after an attack like this. Countries in the EU face terrorism just as the Middle East does and most of the rest of the worlds countries. External instability like this will exist forever unless you want to turn this into 1984 in which case the terrorists win. Why do you even bring up 9/11 and mention that we have no control over attacks against us? Guess what, we have proven that we have some control over how often we get attacked. We responded to 9/11 in a way that collapsed two governments and put us partial control of two different nations. We also increased our own internal security to protect ourselves from the outside. After that we had zero terrorist attacks against us. Our response was powerful and our safeguards were well placed and as a result we are now in more control over attacks against us, wouldn't you agree? Who is more likely to be attacked is probably the US but that doesn't mean we face the greater external instability threat. For instance, the 6'6 linebacker vs the insane person. No one wants to hurt he insane person here yet he has his life at risk. Everyone wants to attack the linebacker yet he is in a position to defend himself and will not lose if attacked. So who has more at risk? The linebacker who will get attacked and win or the insane person who will probably do something stupid and die? I don't know what the odds are of North Korea doing something stupid but the situation doesn't look all that great for them. First off China is the real player here, not the US. China can dictate what North Korea does or doesn't do. If China puts heat on North Korea they will give in. The US can only use force to make North Korea give in. So how might China turn against North Korea? Surely North Korea won't make a first strike as that is suicide. They are already completely contained because they depend too much on Chinese support to risk it all. There is no risk-reward ratio for this situation, it is all risk. I think the US will take advantage of this situation by helping (secretly ie Israel) Japan or South Korea to get their own nuclear weapons program going. This will freak the Chinese out instantly and they will demand that the US help end this. The Japanise or South Korean government will claim they are looking to defend themselves from the North Korean threat. The Chinese will have only two choices of either dealing with North Korea and ending the threat or face the threat of Japan and South Korea building a legitimate nuclear defense. China will do what is in their interest which is drop the support of North Korea. At that point North Korea will have everything to lose and nothing to gain. They will have the option of either ending their program, keeping their program and being cut off from the world, or attacking and going out in a blaze of horrifying glory. This is a chess game that the US can control through China or China can simply take control and bring it to an end right now. My opinion remains that the US is not as threatened by external instability as North Korea is. I believe the US can even guide the destruction of North Korea if we wish to and make it look legitimate to the world. The US has such great power, strength, and size that we can overcome a lot of obsticles while North Korea cannot overcome the simplest of them. The war on terrorism is as threatening to the US as WWII and yet we are being as successful in this war as we were in WWII. North Korea is now facing the threat of WWIII coming to them as well as the threat of humiliation if forced to drop their nuclear weapons program and the risk of isolating themselves from the world if they don't drop their program. The US faces only 1 of these threats and we of course are able to maintain a 'legitimate' nuclear weapons program all the while. North Korea is going to inevitably be hurt by external forces because of their external instability very badly just as the US will be. It is just a matter of who can shake it off and dish some out and who cannot.","u-s-imperialism","09:57 PM","government-debates","58"
