"10-07-2003","175",3,"AMD4EVER","None","Very nice post Montalban. I agree with almost everything you said. I am curious though, do you believe that the US only became a world power after WWII and it was because they were late to the battle?","montalban","18453","The US was a world power before WWII. However their power was checked by the fact that there wasn't a whole lot of places to expand into. The US was fortunate that they came through WWII without any major damage to mid-continental USA. The Soviets were not quite so lucky, having lost 20,000,000 people and much of their industrial lands had been devestated.","u-s-imperialism","05:59 AM","government-debates","31"
"10-07-2003","175",3,"sundowner","None","No, we never walked into someones land and claimed it as our own, making them ""subjects"" of our own. This is not what Americans would do. We never took over the land of others for our own use and placed them into ""reservations"". We never almost decimated an entire race of people so we could stretch sea to shining sea. We never...wait...yes we did. Oh well, maybe they did not fit the definition of a third world country, so I guess it was ok.","montalban","18454","Really? There are many Native Americans that would strongly disagree. What do you mean by 'we never almost decimate an entire race'? This makes no sense Anyway You annexed the sovereign state of Texas (albeit with the agreement of a large number of Texans). Then you took lands of Mexico, by force, though you did give them some money. You took land of the Spanish (Puerto Rico is still US territory! So too, I believe, is Guam. ""Between the Civil War and 1900, the U.S. began its apprenticeship as an imperial power. As early as the 1850's, the U.S. was sending troops to Argentina, Nicaragua, Japan, Uruguay and China, as well as eyeing sugar rich Cuba for annexation purposes.The latter half of the Nineteenth Century was spent in industrialization and the instalment and maintenance of a social order that would prove beneficial to capitalist expansion and progress. "" http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/9852/usimp.htm You still have American Samoa, the US Virgin Islands Hawaii too was a state that had a monarchy; the first reigning monarch of any nation to visit the USA in fact! US citizens orchestrated a coup there, then applied for admission to the US. ""Between the end of the Spanish-American War and the dawn of the Great Depression, the United States sent troops to Latin American countries thirty-two times.

To respond to your post after this one dealing with US imperialism, I can only say that this seems like a strange debate. I think everyone must know that the US has been imperialistic in the past just as many other countries have been. As of today we are less worried about expanding our lands as we did in the past because now we are focused on wealth and power through economics. The US continues to grow in power and our influence spreads daily into many countries around the world. This is the modern US form of imperialism. Is there anyone actually debating that the US has been and still is imperialistic? Is there anyone who is even willing to debate that the next superpower, whoever it may be, won't be imperialistic?","u-s-imperialism","09:22 AM","government-debates","33"

It just happens that they had even more rural and mining areas... just like the fact that although they lost 20,000,000 people they had millions more. This however is not the argument I am trying to make; that they only succeeded because they had even more. I wanted recognition of the many things that they lost. Not everyone, you need to see the posts of Kelvin et al on this. I mentioned this on another forum, that perhaps China or India might be - this is just speculation, however even that was enough to get the blood boiled of RevHellBound. All empires come and go. The most expansive - Britain's lasted a few centuries. Who know what would be the cause of the US crumbling away - perhaps it would be internal forces, because there seems to be an inordinate amount of Americans at war in one form of another with their own government. Only in totalitarian nations have I come across so many people in fear of their own government! With so many people disliking the American government - even a right-wing 'small government' like the one in power now, surely it must fall.","u-s-imperialism","06:38 AM","government-debates","36"
"10-08-2003","175",3,"None","None","None","AMD4EVER","18674","As it stands now I don't think that the US government will fall because of internal influences. As long as we maintain our standing as an economic power there is no real threat that can be posed to our government. The British empire collapsed because they were spread way too thin and couldn't really defend all their territories. The US is well covered as far as it's own population goes. There really is no rising threat in the internal population that is threatening the government. I just don't find it too realistic that the US will collapse from the inside out instead of the other way around. External forces are previlant in our globalized system especially in the case of economics. If another country becomes an economic power, such as China and India probably will, then they will pose an external threat to the US way of life. This may lead to a chain reaction that eventually collapses the US. Still I think it will take some major external pressure like this before the internal forces can even become important enough to threaten the US empire. However, because of globalization it is likely that the US and the next superpower(s) will be economically linked and will keep each other afloat as long as war doesn't break out. This attribute of globalization has been keeping stability in the worlds economic powers for years now and I wouldn't suspect that this will change in the future either. The US form of imperialism has been one that has both strengthend ourselves and has brought stability to the worlds strongest countries as well as increased stability in the third world countries. With the way that this system works it will either take a major world war or a major economic collapse before the US or any other major superpower could fall in my opinion. The entire system of globalization and the free market would have to fail in order for an empire the size and strength of the US to crumble from the inside.","u-s-imperialism","10:30 AM","government-debates","37"

"10-10-2003","175",3,"mizmaxx","None","So three people getting filthy rich while everyone else starves is a good thing? Cultural degradation doesn't lead to stability, sorry.

I never said all dictatorships were caused by the US. .... that you know of.","AMD4EVER","18884","I'd say out of the 6 billion people on Earth at least 4 billion of them are richer right now than they would be had the economic systems never changed since the era of globalization began. I don't think the number is as small as 3 people. How doesn't it lead to stability. Think China and their reform to capitalism and westernization. Are them more of a threat to the world as a communist nation or as a globalized nation? It will be stabilizing to have them westernize. However, it isn't necessarily good. Yeah I can see what you mean. The people are just about ready to burst because the US and Canada depend so much on each other. Nor did I.

Wouldn't that be great Governments provide infrustructure, roads, reails, electricity, and water? lol, well I can't debate that! Thank goodness for our government in that case.
