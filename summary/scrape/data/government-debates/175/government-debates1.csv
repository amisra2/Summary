I was wondering if any of them can back this accusation up with facts. If you look at the definition of empire, I think you will find that this does not accurately describe the position of the United States. Furthermore, the U.S. was never really competitive in the 19th-20th century race to colonize third world countries. What facts support your claim that America is an empire and/or a colonist? Empire: a major political unit having a territory of great extent or a number of territories or people under a single soveriegn authority; esp: one having an emperor as chief of state. (Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 10th Edition) Colonialism: control by one power over a dependent area or people (Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 10th Edition) Please give me your version of why the U.S. is considered by you to be an empire. Give historic facts that back your position if necessary. Is the left's attempt to reclassify the United States another example of them misrepresenting the facts? Do the communists have a version of history distorted enough to rival Karl Marx or Noam Chomsky?","u-s-imperialism","12:10 AM","government-debates","1"

I think I am going to like it here, but we must debate this anti-Bush stance of yours sometime soon. I would like to get that out of the way soon.","u-s-imperialism","03:58 AM","government-debates","5"

Not so long ago there was a doco on Gen Douglas MacArthur called ""American Caesar"". Only an drongo would assume that MacArthur a) wore a toga b) addressed the senate c) had ambitions on becoming emperor The US can be described as an empire if you take into account the economic, military, cultural dominance it has over the world. I'm actually suprised that you're not all going U-S-A U-S-A we're #1 Are you ashamed of the USA's position of dominence?","u-s-imperialism","05:10 AM","government-debates","6"

You're in 'Pool B' playing Scotland, Fiji, Japan, and your close ally, France. Australia (""the Wallabies"") have 'Pool A' against Argentina, Ireland, Namibia and Romania. Other nations playing are; Canada South Aftica England Samoa Georgia Uruguay New Zealand Wales Italy and Tonga It a game with 15 per side. There's no specialist offence/defence/kickers etc. basically you double-up as offence when you have the ball, defence when you don't. There's little in the way of bodily protection either. The previous world cup winners are (in order...) New Zealand Australia South Africa Australia","u-s-imperialism","11:48 PM","government-debates","10"

Wow... the things you learn. lol","montalban","16415","According to my rugby sources, it was more popular in the USA in 1900 than any other code of football, and Teddy Roosevelt wanted it promoted heavily. It failed because it was still a totally amateur sport, and the rising American Football had more money. In similar fashion it split in Australia and the UK, with a professional form, Rugby League emerging. Rugby Union has only just gone fully professional in the last decade. I played it at school, but I like Rugby League better. Still, we are the current world champions - and it's actually a proper international event, not like a world champion of baseball!","u-s-imperialism","08:29 PM","government-debates","12"
"09-23-2003","175",1,"mizmaxx","None","So, anyway, back to the topic... Well, I'm not a ""communist"", but I do recognize the US as an imperialist state. The US was not part of the European ""race"" for the colonization of Africa, Asia and Australia because it was busy colonizing the US. They called it ""how the West was won"". The US is a former British colony whose colonists decided to finish the job alone from where they were. That's the only difference between the US and, say, South Africa. The reason they could do this was because of the ""luck"" of the effectiveness of the use of biological war against the First Nations- through smallpox mostly. Thus, wereas most other colonized areas remained populated by indigenous peoples, the American invaders were able to push the indigenous population further and further west until they almost completely eradicated them. This combined with the desire for land fueled by British industrialisation and the concomitant push of peasants off their land into crappy city jobs and squalor, created America. Of course, colonisation must keep on going, the empire must grow, so there was Mexico, Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico. It was during this time that people started to revolt in large numbers globally, and the powers that be recognized that they would have to try something different. So instead of explicit colonialism through political colonies, the US simply threatens or attacks with their sizeable army anyone whose resources appeal to them, and sets up a military presence to make sure it continues. As they say, the truth is out there....","montalban","16868","Sorry, but I get carried away when it comes to talking footy. (that's football) Politically, I'm a socialist.* I thought I'd just announce that as we're into confession mode. The USA is an imperial power. However it decided to rule by the cheap means; economy. So, in China for example, in the 1800s, when it was impossible with it to compete with Britain, it called for an 'open-door' policy. It wanted 'free trade' because it couldn't afford to colonise parts of China. Britain claimed zones of 'influence' in China, but it too didn't have the resources to annex big slabs of land. So in part it supported this 'open-door' policy. So American seemingly benign stance was based on politico-economic realities When the USA could take something cheaply, they did, orchestrating a war with light-weights such as Spain. It annexed Hawaii, which was almost an independent kingdom. It waited till the last moment to join in WWI. It sat by while the democracies, Britain and France were being hacked to death by Nazi Germany. American culture rules supreme too. I live in a small nation (by population standards). We are aware of what happens in the USA, with baseball, gridiron, basketball etc. You'd never have heard of Rugby Union - which we're world champions of. Cricket, as well. I'm not complaining, just stating a fact. You guys are the rule by which most people are either trying to live by, or react against. *Religiously I'm ultra-conservative. I believe Jesus was a socialist, and will follow Him. It may explain a bit of schizoid behaviour. It's also why I'm so argumentative, because I disagree with people on either one, or the other front.","u-s-imperialism","06:14 AM","government-debates","14"

In our past we have tried to expand our area of control as much as possible while other powerful countries were grasping at areas of land around the world. Most of this expansion has ended and now it would seem that economics are where the US influence is spreading. Even our culture has begun to spread across the world as has our language and people. We are buying control and using our economic power to attain more economic power. We have used our technology as well to gain power. One shocking example of this is that much of Europe is dependent on our GPS system in ways pertaining to their military and we could theoretically block GPS signals to them at any time. So I'll go as far as to say that the US is always going to look to expand it's influence on the rest of the world, but we could go much further than this. Our military strength is a bargaining tool and our political connections would allow us to forum quite a powerful army if indeed we wished to do so. I don't doubt that the US with the support of Russia or China or NATO or the UN could take control of much of the world through force. I don't doubt that had Germany/Japan or Russia/China become the superpowers that the threat of force could have been the most dominant way of expanding areas of control. Although I doubt that every country is happy to see the US gaining more influence and control in the world through the use of politics, technology, and economy, I don't think they would be any happier with many of the other superpowers that could have taken the US's place.","u-s-imperialism","01:30 PM","government-debates","15"
