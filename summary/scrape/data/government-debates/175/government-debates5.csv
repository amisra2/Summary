"10-14-2003","175",5,"mizmaxx","None","How boring. I hope they do bomb the US, but actually get the pentagon this time. Of course, dumb patriots will let the gov't do anything then. I remember when the show ""Talking to Americans"" asked random Americans whether they should bomb Saskatchewan. Without asking for any more information, people gave long explanations about how Saskatchewan needed to be put under control and all kinds of bs. Of course, Saskatchewan is a Canadian province which is not at all being considered a threat by the US gov't. That doesn't matter. The US political climate is such right now that people will swallow any amount of bs, and are willing to excuse any action on the part of their gov't. Pathetic.","kelvin90701","19227","First off, your sick. To actually want to see more death and destruction. Are Americans somehow less intelligent? Your notions are racist for lack of a better term. What to meet stupid? Walk out your front door and sample the people on the side walk. You'll find the same stupid around the world.","u-s-imperialism","01:49 AM","government-debates","61"
"10-14-2003","175",5,"AMD4EVER","None","As compared to how they would be during a period of instability? I'm not surprised that you declare the US evil for causing instability but give it no credit for creating this stability that we have been focused on.","montalban","19231","So, a good strong jack-boot leader is preferable - stability at any cost? Like the sword of Damacles, the US hangs over the rest of the 'free-world', ready to drop-in the moment our freedoms aren't the way you like it. Take Iraq for example. The US enters as liberators yet you won't let many of the Iraqi clerics have political say even though it's permissable in their society and foreign to your own So, you're establishing a form of government that you like, not the one the Iraqis like","u-s-imperialism","03:19 AM","government-debates","62"

Americans want to use force first.","u-s-imperialism","03:27 AM","government-debates","63"

The US being the only superpower has helped bring stability to the world. US liberators need to stabilize Iraq before we can put them in power. If only they realized that... We are not going to force a certain government in Iraq although we will push to get one we like in control","u-s-imperialism","07:02 AM","government-debates","64"

It is good to become stable as you are then able to focus on more important things after that point. So is the US stable? Yes. Is stability good? Yes. Does this make the US good? Only in terms of keeping stability, yes it does.","u-s-imperialism","07:33 AM","government-debates","66"

Ask they natives in your country what they think of YOUR imperialism. You keep hammering the point that somehow Americans are genitcally bred for imperialism or have a tendancy for crimes against humanity. Looking for someone to bash?

I've never denied the crimes committed by my government. You on the other hand do.* So, if you actually want to address the issue of US Imperialism (the subject of this thread) then please do. And please stop trying to deflect attention from your own nation's wrongs. If you want to critique Australia, start another thread. *You accused me on another thread of not recognising that the US saved Australia. I did. And I pointed out that you didn't recognise the efforts of China and the Soviet Union. Now, instead of taking that in, you just come up with the same jingo again. A jingo is not an argument.","u-s-imperialism","06:53 AM","government-debates","70"

I for one acknowledge the hurts, hates and injury caused by my nation. On numerous posts I have stated as much. Kelvin, instead of taking time out to reflect on what the US has done - and this thread is called ""US Imperialism"" instead just deflects arguments back on people... to the effect of saying ""Don't criticise the US, you've done bad things!"" Yet, he's not even game to recognise the injuries caused by US Imperialism, and, even though all life is sacred, the US has caused a lot more misery than Australia. I don't like dealing with people who sprout a jingo rather than an argument. However at the same time other people are reading these posts too.","u-s-imperialism","06:57 AM","government-debates","71"

Guaranteed the Pentagon causes enough death and destruction on a daily basis that, on balance, bombing it would probably decrease the levels temporarily.","kelvin90701","20220","That is exactly the rationale that was used for killing people at both the Pentagon and the towers.","u-s-imperialism","08:20 PM","government-debates","73"
