"09-25-2003","175",2,"mizmaxx","None","Well, Russia is colder, so... Paul Bernardo, he was a Canadian serial killer. Politics, technology and economy? Try ""threat of force"". No, the rest of the world (as well as many US people) are NOT ""happy"" to see little US flags on the bombs dropping on their houses and the guns being used to shoot their babies. The argument ""someone else might be doing it if it weren't us"" is no excuse. It's an absurd moral argument. I could just shoot you, because if I don't someone else will, just look at the murder rates in the US! AT any rate, the question was US=Imperialist? Unequivocally yes.","AMD4EVER","17304","I think they were a little more than just colder. Against who? Have we used a threat of force against sensible country lately? Iraq wasn't sensible nor is Iran, Afghanistan, or North Korea. We use politics, technology, and the economy to expand our influence, not force. If we wanted to use force then surely our borders would be rapidly changing. That is not the case. Nor is the world ever happy to see anyones flag on a bomb that will drop on their homes. The US + UN sees to it that the countries who are becoming a threat to the world are kept under control. Neither the US or UN just randomly says hey lets attack this country today. Weak indeed but a good point nonetheless. The US will one day not be the strongest country in the world. It is likely that China will surpass us one day just as the EU may do so as well if they can get their act together. I would give it maybe 20 more years before the US isn't considered the only superpower in the world. Do you think that the future is brighter because of this? Will the next superpower be less focused on spreading their influence? I already agreed with this. The point I'm trying to make is that you have to keep it in perspective. The previous superpowers of the world tried to expand their influence just as the current ones do and the future ones will too. That is what you get for being a world leader.","u-s-imperialism","01:37 PM","government-debates","19"

It is in fact an imperialist myth, thank you very much, to say that you saved us. American involvement in WWII did not begin in 1939, when we went to war. It didn't despite your commitment to aid China (attacked since 1933). You intervened in your own national interest. IF you saved us, it was in your national interest - in an effort to have a strong supply base to strike back at Japan. Let's settle the record. When Japan entered the war, most of our forces were overseas fighting against the Germans and Italians in North Africa. Our Prime Minister, John Curtin wanted to withdraw out troops to defend our own country. This became more critical when the Japanese had very early successes in Singapore and the Philippines. ""Winston Churchill wanted these troops to be diverted to Burma to stop the Japanese from invading India ""Backed unanimously by War Cabinet and caucus, Curtin followed the formal advice. He had no doubts and days and nights of bitter cable exchanges with Churchill followed. President Roosevelt was also bringing pressure to bear. Parliament met twice in secret session. The last straw was Churchill ordering the 7th Division to turn north for Burma, but he had to give way after no fewer than four staunch Australian protests. Curtin played a pivotal role in changing Australia from a nation with an inward perspective, regarding itself as a colonial satellite of Great Britain which sided automatically with the Mother country, to a nation with a more international outlook capable and prepared to make its own decisions. By standing up to Churchill, he ensured that Australia's interests were not overridden by Britain's."" http://john.curtin.edu.au/resources/...y/details.html Roosevelt wanted Australia's troops, not to defend our own country, but to defend India (which both he and Churchill believed was more important than Australia). ""One could conclude that Curtin's place in Australian history is on a spur to the main path of advance. He stood up to Roosevelt and Churchill and saved Australian troops of the 7th Division from joining the 8th in Japanese prisoner of war camps, their almost certain fate if committed to Burma without air support or sea control, and under British command. He put Australia on a total war footing. He became the central figure in one of our most affecting stories. But he did not fight the Battle of Australia because it never took place, he did not ""save"" Australia from a Japanese attack which was always unlikely and soon impossible, and he did not take part in the key strategic decisions of the Pacific war. As a war lord Curtin was not in the class of Churchill or Roosevelt."" http://john.curtin.edu.au/events/speeches/edwardsj.html Our war effort was not as mighty as the USA's, however in your national interest, you at first wanted to abandon Australia! Then when Curtin stood up to you you made plans on how to then best carry out the war, from Australia. However, even then, excepting for your navy, your army still had to be raised - and many of the soldiers were ear-marked not for the Pacific, but for Britain. ""During 1942, US forces in Australia steadily increased in number, but did not exceed Australian forces until 1943. Until then, the country?s defence relied mainly on Australian efforts, reinforced by the occasional intervention of US naval forces from Hawaii."" http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/mee...eName=inoffice ""With their naval forces effectively defeated, the Japanese called off their planned capture of Port Moresby by sea. Instead they launched a land attack, across the Owen Stanley mountains. Establishing bases on the north coast of New Guinea, the Japanese forces began the assault on Port Moresby. MacArthur was slow to respond to this challenge, not believing a successful attack across the forbidding terrain was likely. But the Japanese soldiers captured Kokoda, and pushed on towards Port Moresby. At MacArthur?s urging, Curtin ordered the Australian army commander, General Thomas Blamey, to go to Port Moresby to take personal charge of its defence. Blamey arrived at Port Moresby in late September, in the middle of an eight-week Australian offensive on the Kokoda Trail. But the Japanese defeat at Milne Bay made their advance impossible, and the victory at Kokoda on 2 November 1942 marked the turning point in the southward sweep of the Japanese offensive. The Japanese commanders turned their attention to the Solomon Islands base of Guadalcanal."" (Ibid) So, even when we were allies, you were quite prepared to abandon us, because in the global scheme of things, 7million Australians were not as important as the wealth of supplies from India! Thank you America for saving us! I suggest in future you do a more thorough research because history is my favourite subject... and I'll ping you every time.","u-s-imperialism","01:13 AM","government-debates","23"

I do not deny the American effort which was significant, second only to the Soviet Union in Europe... In the Pacific, China took on far more divisions of the Japanese army than the USA. ""The China Theatre of Operations more resembled the Soviet-German war on the Eastern Front than the war in the Pacific or the war in Western Europe. On the Asian continent, as on the Eastern Front, an Allied partner, China, carried the brunt of the fighting."" http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/brochures/72-38/72-38.htm You stated that America 'saved' Australia. As the Soviet Union took on more troops than the Americans ever did, it makes just as much sense as saying that the Soviet Union saved the United States. (using your logic). Also, you could say China saved you too, by tying up millions of Japanese soldiers. China suffered much more as a result. ""The war against China had lead to 4 million Chinese casualties with 60 million made homeless"" http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/china_war.htm By using the word 'saved' you are implying an altruistic motive. But I don't ascribe any pure motives that you seem to. Because, when it seemed like it was advantageous to American and Britain they were both willing to sacrifice Australia for the over-all war-effort - as I have shown in my previous post. It was only that the Australian Prime Minister forced your hand, by recalling our troops to defend Australia (and not Burma). You bore the brunt of the naval and air war in the Pacific, and much of the land war. I have never denied this. Every nation looks after its own interests first. That is why the good old USA sat back and did nothing as most of Europe fell to the Nazis; the most evil empire that has ever existed. The good old USA was even prepared to watch Britain fall by the wayside. You sat back for even longer as China was raped by Japan since 1937. After watching the world tear itself apart, the US finally intervened... and emerged as the world power... after Germany, France, Britain, Italy etc had exhausted themselves.
