"10-10-2003","175",4,"AMD4EVER","None","How would you define stability? Has Cambodia ever been stable? Are they more unstable now than they were 30 years ago? What is the reasoning behind their stability or instability?","montalban","18893","Rather than just ask you to define it, after all, it is you who claimed that the world is stable, I will have a crack at it. Looking at the world since 1945... Generally, I would call Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain etc stable. Japan is, so to Canada, and the Scandinavian countries. None of the nations has been invaded by US troops since WWII (though Japan was 'occupied') Cambodia is not the best example I could have used. Cambodia was in an embryonic state - having gained independence from France, it never really got a chance to get its feet on the ground. Chile for instance had a democratically elected Socialist Government - which was thrown out in a US sponsored coup, so it is academic as to whether this government could have been sustained - it just never had a chance to show us. Nicaragua was fairly stable once the Sandanistas came to power in the early 1980s despite the USA's best efforts. I think however you implied that the world has been pretty much stable - and that this is a good thing. Saudi Arabia has been stable in the years I've looked at here. However, it is hardly a beacon for liberal ideals. Same with Burma, Libya, (etc - each with long term governments) I think stability as you see it is over-rated in that stability itself is not a good measure for 'goodness'. The fact however is the US has intervened in so many countries; and that this is proof of imperialism.","u-s-imperialism","09:11 AM","government-debates","46"

Most of the 3rd worlders were never that stable to begin with and were either nearing a point of instability in their own nation or ready to destabilize other nations before the US took action. Considering the threat of nuclear war that can come from almost any country I consider stability to be very important. It isn't necessarily as 'good' as the best thing possible but it surely isn't bad. Stability is only over-rated if you assuming instability doesn't involve war and poorer quality of life for the majority. Instability would be like what you have in North Korea. They are threatening to destabilize an area and in so doing they could possibly kill millions of people. Instability is very dangerous and can have serious consequences. The fact that the US is imperialistic has helped us form stability in the majority of the world. Also the form of stability they offer is that of a free market and democracy. That is a very good form of stability for the majority of the people on the planet as it will not only allow us to live comfortably but it will also allow for efficiency, productivity, and technological advancement while at the same time deter war with countries since they become interdependent.","u-s-imperialism","09:26 AM","government-debates","47"

How could you tell? Since 1945 for example, most of the 3rd world has undergone decolonisation, and any time they get a good start, the US intervenes... such as I mentioned with Chile. They had a progress to democracy, however the people foolishly elected a government that the USA did not like... and sure enough the Pinochet governmet was 'stable' in that it protected US economic interests. But it was hardly a country that I'd want to live in. [QUOTE=AMD4EVERStability is only over-rated if you assuming instability doesn't involve war and poorer quality of life for the majority.

Would you want to live there? Stablility is of itself a poor measure. The Soviet Union was stable for 40 years. North Korea has had only one change of government (as least as far as leadership is concerned) in the post-war years. Again, the 'free market' is a misnomer. The US has only intervened where economics has demanded it, not human rights/democracy.","u-s-imperialism","09:45 AM","government-debates","48"

That is my point. Stability doesn't equal 1st world country but it does make life better. North Korea isn't unstable within it's borders as it is outside it's borders. They are creating instability with neighbors and that in turn could cause life to get a lot worse for them and their neighbors. Stability would be beneficial here. Free market is our economic system. Whatever our economic system is, that is what free market currently is. The US doesn't have to interven in every situation. Because of the free market system we simply cannot afford to interven in every single matter. We almost have to have a way to refund our intervention if we are to interven therefore it makes sense that most of our interventions will be economic based. This is one reason why stability is almost forced in the world between the strongest nations. They cannot possibly benefit from attacking another powerful nation because they will lose more economy than they will gain and in turn will not benefit them.","u-s-imperialism","10:07 AM","government-debates","49"

I said they were internally stable so we agree here, ahem. Also the US is not unstable as far as external physical forces are to us. Economic forces you could make a point but not the extent that everyone is declaring sanctions against us. That is what North Korea is basically doing only it is a physical force that is building against them. The US has no external threat against them at this time that is as threatening as what North Korea is facing and that is because the US is far more externally stable than North Korea is. I'm not surprised that you declare the US evil for causing instability but give it no credit for creating this stability that we have been focused on.","u-s-imperialism","12:30 AM","government-debates","52"
"10-11-2003","175",4,"sundowner","None","Huh? I must give you credit on most of your opinions on this thread, but what? The US has external threats all over the world, which is why our military is now spread all over the place. We are putting our fingers in the rapidly appearing holes in the dam, but we are running out of fingers. I do agree that North Korea is creating their own problem, and this would be easily fixed, but the problems faced by the US are multi-faceted and not quite so easy to remedy. If anything, I would argue that N. Korea is far more threatening to the rest of the world, including the US, than the rest of the world is to them.","AMD4EVER","19025","The US would need to face a Russian threat for it to be as great of a threat as North Korea is facing today. The US does have threats all over the place but no where near the level of threat that North Korea is facing. North Korea has the potenial to glow in the dark. The US doesn't face that much of a threat. Only Russia could actually accomplish such a thing unless we turned our nukes on ourselves. North Korea has the potential to drop to zero in population while the US doesn't. North Korea has the potential to lose a great percentage of their population while the US doesn't. The claim that North Korea is more of a threat to us than we are to them is correct in one way. It would be like an insane person being more of a risk to a 6'6 linebacker than the linebacker is to him since the linebacker cares if he gets hurt while the insane person doesn't. Therefore the insane person has less to lose and probably doesn't feel as threatened as the linebacker does. However, in reality the complete opposite is really true. If the insane person attacks he would likely be killed. So even as it may seem like the linebacker is more threatened and willing to avoid conflict than the insane person, the insane person is the only one risking death. The North Korean problem may be a short term one while the US problem may last for centuries. Still I would place my money on the US being around 50 years from now rather than North Korea based on not only recent events, but also based on South Korean and Japanise threats as well as their small size and big mouth. But I'm really not even focusing on the future threats as much as I am the short term threats. Comparing the short term threat North Korea faces, it far exceeds what the US has faced since the Cold War.","u-s-imperialism","05:41 PM","government-debates","54"
"10-11-2003","175",4,"sundowner","None","And we don't? That is why we are closely monitoring N. Korea and Iran right now. We are not 100% positive that these nations do not already have nuclear weapons. What about the terrorists? It is possible that they could have ""pruchased"" nuclear weapons or the materials neccesary for nuclear weapons. We also have the potential to be attacked with chemical weapons or biological agents like Anthrax. You think the 5 people killed by the Anthrax attacks were bad, what would happen if Anthrax was introduced to the water supply, or detonated in a so called ""dirty bomb"" over a major population center. The fall out form biological agents could not only kill people for 100's of miles, but continue to kill people for years. We might be able to wipe them off the map, but you will see conventional war with N. Korea long before you ever see them glow...(not a bad idea though). Like those 19 insane terrorists on 9/11? The ones who died for their cause..and took 3000 innocent Americans with them? Like that? Or North Korea could continue to be a thorn in the side of the world as they have done since the 1950's. They could require monitoring and a sizealbe force of our military to watch them as they have done for 50+ years. As far as big mouth...you are absolutely correct, old Kimmy needs a muzzle and a haircut. As far as small, not quite. N. Korea has one of the largest armies in the world, and they could threaten many of our allies in a number of ways, like S. Korea, or Japan. Remember, we fought them once, yet the threat remains. Are we likely to lose today, probably not, but engaging in war with N. Korea is a huge risk to the US.","AMD4EVER","19053","Name one threat that could cover 10% of our territory with nuclear explosions? North Korea is facing the threat of having at least that done to them if they really do launch an attack on the US. Sure the US will feel like it lost more but logically the US will lose less than North Korea as North Korea will face the inevitable task of surrender and probably end up in US or South Korean hands. North Korea has the possibility of not existing. How can you argue that the US faces a greater threat than this in the short term? Either this is a weak argument or you are missing the point here. The point is that we are the linebacker and North Korea is the insane person. That sums up almost everything. You are saying ""But the US lost 3,000 people and look how upset that made them"" while I'm saying 3,000 is .00001% of our population and North Korea stands to lose a whole lot more than that percentage if their external stability fails. You are focusing on who will feel the most for their loss while I'm focusing on the numbers and percents and final outcomes. North Korea is clearly troubled by greater external threat than the US is even if they don't care about it as much as the US does. Don't you agree with this? North Korea will probably continue to be a thorn in our side and as long as that is true they will face great external instability. They are risking everything by threatening us and should they follow through we will be hurt but they will be dead. They are small in land size and that means a single nuke will destroy a greater percentage of their land than a single nuke will do to the US. This becomes a big deal in nuclear battles as does population and world connections. The US would have support in a nuclear conflict if attacked. North Korea is likely to be the one attacking so they would have little in the way of world connections. This also hurts them because they are too small to completely supply themselves and this can be shown based on their starving populations even while they recieve aid packages from the US and China. Small matters especially in nuclear conflict. As for their army they are a threat but they are not as threatening as their numbers would bear out. The country would be in so much chaos after a few nuclear strikes that I wouldn't expect them to be able to stand up to a US led attack and it could even be Iraq all over again. The chain of command would fail as poor communications and lack of supply + food + oil becomes and issue. A broken North Korea would crumble especially in the face of a very angry US led attack. Their military wouldn't be able to protect anything and would be best served to begin a gurilla war because they would fail in straight conflict. You prove my point when you bring up the Korean war. The North Koreans controlled almost the whole of Korea and we took almost EVERYTHING back. They had nothing except a sure defeat until the Chinese got involved. This is the world connection that the North Koreans lack. Sure China will support North Korea as long as they are being good. If you see the North march on Seoul or nuke Japan or, God forbid, Los Angeles, I would wager a guess that China will march on North Korea in response. China surely wouldn't support the North Koreans for being the aggressor nor did they do so in the Korean war. In short, North Korea faces external stability issues just as the US does. The problem for North Korea is that they cannot deal with the consequences of extreme instability while the US can. A few chemical and nuclear strikes on the US will hurt us. That is what the US faces in an extreme case. The force of a US led war against North Korea is what the North Koreans face in an extreme case. They would either be destroyed or lose control over their country. Having said all this I would like to ask this question of you again. Does the US really have a great problem with external instability than the North Koreans do at this time?","u-s-imperialism","09:11 PM","government-debates","56"
"10-11-2003","175",4,"sundowner","None","And simply I will answer you with yes. N. Korea will not come to harm unless they push the issue and make the world attack them. They control this destiny, and therefore the threat can be mitigated by themselves. The US, regardless of what we do, who we try to make friends with, or what foreign policy we change will continue to be a target for extremist regimes throughout the world. We do not control who attacks us, the terrorist regimes are not going to wait for us to do anything to them before they attack...as seen on 9/11, they will just attack us. It is not a numbers game to me as far as who will lose more people, or how much will be destroyed. When I consider threats, I consider who is more likely to be attacked, and my answer remains the US.","AMD4EVER","19058","North Korea even faces the threat of attack without having to push the issue. See Iraq for more info. North Korea doesn't control their own destiny. If the US wants a war all they have to do is cut aid to North Korea and sanction them up the ***. The North will have no choice but to go to war and the US will be ready. The North has backed themselves into a corner where the US has control of their future in more ways than one. The one thing they have going for them is the fact that the US doesn't want a nuclear conflict. But should the US decide to go forward with this anyways they are the ones in control of how far this conflict will escalate. North Korea is in the hands of the US before and after war begins, that is not control. No one can put the US in this situation. The terrorists and terrorist supporters can only force the US to attack them, their homes, and way of life and await defeat. A nuclear attack against us will probably cause the fall of several countries while a nuclear attack against North Korea would cause the fall of their country. Also your note of no matter who the US makes friends with we will still have enemies can apply to every country. At least the US is in a great position to defend themselves after an attack like this. Countries in the EU face terrorism just as the Middle East does and most of the rest of the worlds countries. External instability like this will exist forever unless you want to turn this into 1984 in which case the terrorists win. Why do you even bring up 9/11 and mention that we have no control over attacks against us? Guess what, we have proven that we have some control over how often we get attacked. We responded to 9/11 in a way that collapsed two governments and put us partial control of two different nations. We also increased our own internal security to protect ourselves from the outside. After that we had zero terrorist attacks against us. Our response was powerful and our safeguards were well placed and as a result we are now in more control over attacks against us, wouldn't you agree? Who is more likely to be attacked is probably the US but that doesn't mean we face the greater external instability threat. For instance, the 6'6 linebacker vs the insane person. No one wants to hurt he insane person here yet he has his life at risk. Everyone wants to attack the linebacker yet he is in a position to defend himself and will not lose if attacked. So who has more at risk? The linebacker who will get attacked and win or the insane person who will probably do something stupid and die? I don't know what the odds are of North Korea doing something stupid but the situation doesn't look all that great for them. First off China is the real player here, not the US. China can dictate what North Korea does or doesn't do. If China puts heat on North Korea they will give in. The US can only use force to make North Korea give in. So how might China turn against North Korea? Surely North Korea won't make a first strike as that is suicide. They are already completely contained because they depend too much on Chinese support to risk it all. There is no risk-reward ratio for this situation, it is all risk. I think the US will take advantage of this situation by helping (secretly ie Israel) Japan or South Korea to get their own nuclear weapons program going. This will freak the Chinese out instantly and they will demand that the US help end this. The Japanise or South Korean government will claim they are looking to defend themselves from the North Korean threat. The Chinese will have only two choices of either dealing with North Korea and ending the threat or face the threat of Japan and South Korea building a legitimate nuclear defense. China will do what is in their interest which is drop the support of North Korea. At that point North Korea will have everything to lose and nothing to gain. They will have the option of either ending their program, keeping their program and being cut off from the world, or attacking and going out in a blaze of horrifying glory. This is a chess game that the US can control through China or China can simply take control and bring it to an end right now. My opinion remains that the US is not as threatened by external instability as North Korea is. I believe the US can even guide the destruction of North Korea if we wish to and make it look legitimate to the world. The US has such great power, strength, and size that we can overcome a lot of obsticles while North Korea cannot overcome the simplest of them. The war on terrorism is as threatening to the US as WWII and yet we are being as successful in this war as we were in WWII. North Korea is now facing the threat of WWIII coming to them as well as the threat of humiliation if forced to drop their nuclear weapons program and the risk of isolating themselves from the world if they don't drop their program. The US faces only 1 of these threats and we of course are able to maintain a 'legitimate' nuclear weapons program all the while. North Korea is going to inevitably be hurt by external forces because of their external instability very badly just as the US will be. It is just a matter of who can shake it off and dish some out and who cannot.","u-s-imperialism","09:57 PM","government-debates","58"
