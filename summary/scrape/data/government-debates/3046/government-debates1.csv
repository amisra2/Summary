Why does congress wrestle and wrangle to make a new law only to have one person in a more temporary position veto it? Anyway, long story short, all a president seems to do is cause a lot of problems. Why don't we just abolish the office? We might be better off.","do-we-have-have-president","04:41 PM","government-debates","1"

It doesn't seem we have a very good one right now (supports your statment that the president is blamed). The best answer I could come up with is that we would have to ammend the constitution...that's expensive. We also need a ""Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces"" to make decisions like sitting in a chair reading ""My Pet Goat"" after being informed that our country is under attack.","do-we-have-have-president","05:58 PM","government-debates","2"

"08-30-2004","3046",1,"None","None","None","billsco","64891","I like the presidency. It is endlessly fascinating to read of the men who have occupied this largely figurehead position, yet wielded enormous power through their personalities alone. Teddy Roosevelt and his bully pulpit, for instance, really helped define and enlarge modern presidential parameters. I suppose if your man is not currently sitting in the Oval Office, it isn't as fascinating a story. But as for abolishing the position, I wouldn't like it. There is nothing worse than a senator on a high horse, in case you missed the spate of recent hearings on Capitol Hill, and they would be the main beneficiaries of the power adjustment. In times of need, even a mediocre figurehead is welcome, IMO.","do-we-have-have-president","10:13 AM","government-debates","8"
"09-10-2004","3046",1,"None","None","None","pnac=ww3","66470","Like I said, the responsibilities could be reassigned to people with more specific titles. There could be the National Foreign Liaison. Diplomats would vie to be elected to the highest diplomatic office in the land. There would be an office for Commander in Chief. Chiefs and Generals (principally) would vie for this elected office. There would most likely be MORE checks and balances without a high concentration of power in one man (or office). And all the people in these high up executive offices would know what they are doing. Anyway, this is all dreaming.","do-we-have-have-president","05:06 PM","government-debates","9"

Congressmen would still be congressmen the way they are now. A lot of snags would have to be figured out.

And more so, he is elected on a nationwide winner-take-all basis, so, for example, a 51% Republican nation has 100% control of the presidency.","do-we-have-have-president","10:02 PM","government-debates","13"
