"02-05-2005","3046",2,"Dzeron","None","The problem is that the President is an executive officer, not a legislator. And more so, he is elected on a nationwide winner-take-all basis, so, for example, a 51% Republican nation has 100% control of the presidency.","gmichailovic","89896","You are incorrect. You are basing this on a direct democracy, saying that the majority choice is the winner. In the U.S., the electoral college is used. The majority runner-up can still lose if his opponent has all the right states.","do-we-have-have-president","03:37 AM","government-debates","16"
"02-05-2005","3046",2,"pnac=ww3","None","Since it always seems to be the president who is blamed for a nation's problems and it always looks like it's the executive branch with all the power, why do we need the office of president anymore? Why does congress wrestle and wrangle to make a new law only to have one person in a more temporary position veto it? Anyway, long story short, all a president seems to do is cause a lot of problems. Why don't we just abolish the office? We might be better off.","gmichailovic","89897","Checks and balances is a simple thing. Yes, the President has veto power, but if he vetoes a Bill, it can go back to Congress and be represented, and if 66% (two thirds) of Congress votes yes, it is automatically a law and the President can not prevent it. The President serves a purpose of making sure the laws of Congress are carried out. The President controls our National Military forces. The President is responsible for foreign policy. The President performs many other functions that are essential to our government. Is it possible to create many other positions and fill them up with people that can do all this? Yes, but should we when one person can do it all? I don't think so. It's impractical to have dozens of people of respectable but different political parties running what was one branch of the government. We could end having a National Foreign Liason that is far right and then have a Commander in Chief of the Military that is far left, or the other way around, and there would be a difference of ways. We need a single strong leader to perform tasks, but to an extent, I agree that we need to limit the power one person has. That is why we have a Constitution and our Checks and Balances, the position itself has not grown in power, but the person in it (ahem Bush) whom the people have reelected certainly has given himself a bit more power.","do-we-have-have-president","03:44 AM","government-debates","17"

Under the EC, if I vote Libertarian, and the majority of votes in my state are cast for Republican, my vote is changed to Republican. I hate the system whereby my vote is lumped in with the votes of the bible-bangers around me.","do-we-have-have-president","06:50 PM","government-debates","18"
"02-07-2005","3046",2,"None","None","None","Alan Ryan","90091","Doubts raised about the need for a President could be extended to, is a Head of State necessary at all ? Is he/she just a cosmetic ornament that is merely tolerated for the sake of prestige among nations etc. ? I know the President of the United States has constitutional functions that could hardly be described as ""cosmetic"" in an American government, but perhaps the office has acquired some patronage and some wasteful baggage that could be abandoned with advantage ? At least the President is under notice to quit every four years. The Heads of State where I happen to reside, inherit a position which has existed for many centuries on end. That why an American has the status of a ""citizen"", while I remain a ""subject"".","do-we-have-have-president","11:41 AM","government-debates","19"

Why can't the leader of the winning party meet with other countries representatives, that's all he's meeting half the time?","do-we-have-have-president","04:52 PM","government-debates","21"
