It doesn't seem we have a very good one right now (supports your statment that the president is blamed). The best answer I could come up with is that we would have to ammend the constitution...that's expensive. We also need a ""Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces"" to make decisions like sitting in a chair reading ""My Pet Goat"" after being informed that our country is under attack.","do-we-have-have-president","05:58 PM","government-debates","2"

"08-30-2004","3046",1,"None","None","None","billsco","64891","I like the presidency. It is endlessly fascinating to read of the men who have occupied this largely figurehead position, yet wielded enormous power through their personalities alone. Teddy Roosevelt and his bully pulpit, for instance, really helped define and enlarge modern presidential parameters. I suppose if your man is not currently sitting in the Oval Office, it isn't as fascinating a story. But as for abolishing the position, I wouldn't like it. There is nothing worse than a senator on a high horse, in case you missed the spate of recent hearings on Capitol Hill, and they would be the main beneficiaries of the power adjustment. In times of need, even a mediocre figurehead is welcome, IMO.","do-we-have-have-president","10:13 AM","government-debates","8"

Diplomats would vie to be elected to the highest diplomatic office in the land. There would be an office for Commander in Chief. Chiefs and Generals (principally) would vie for this elected office. There would most likely be MORE checks and balances without a high concentration of power in one man (or office). And all the people in these high up executive offices would know what they are doing. Anyway, this is all dreaming.","do-we-have-have-president","05:06 PM","government-debates","9"

Yes, the President has veto power, but if he vetoes a Bill, it can go back to Congress and be represented, and if 66% (two thirds) of Congress votes yes, it is automatically a law and the President can not prevent it. The President serves a purpose of making sure the laws of Congress are carried out. The President controls our National Military forces. The President is responsible for foreign policy. The President performs many other functions that are essential to our government. Is it possible to create many other positions and fill them up with people that can do all this? Yes, but should we when one person can do it all? I don't think so. It's impractical to have dozens of people of respectable but different political parties running what was one branch of the government. We could end having a National Foreign Liason that is far right and then have a Commander in Chief of the Military that is far left, or the other way around, and there would be a difference of ways. We need a single strong leader to perform tasks, but to an extent, I agree that we need to limit the power one person has. That is why we have a Constitution and our Checks and Balances, the position itself has not grown in power, but the person in it (ahem Bush) whom the people have reelected certainly has given himself a bit more power.","do-we-have-have-president","03:44 AM","government-debates","17"

Under the EC, if I vote Libertarian, and the majority of votes in my state are cast for Republican, my vote is changed to Republican. I hate the system whereby my vote is lumped in with the votes of the bible-bangers around me.","do-we-have-have-president","06:50 PM","government-debates","18"

Is he/she just a cosmetic ornament that is merely tolerated for the sake of prestige among nations etc. ? I know the President of the United States has constitutional functions that could hardly be described as ""cosmetic"" in an American government, but perhaps the office has acquired some patronage and some wasteful baggage that could be abandoned with advantage ? At least the President is under notice to quit every four years. The Heads of State where I happen to reside, inherit a position which has existed for many centuries on end. That why an American has the status of a ""citizen"", while I remain a ""subject"".","do-we-have-have-president","11:41 AM","government-debates","19"
