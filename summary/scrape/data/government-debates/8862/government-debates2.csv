Honestly, how much dose it cost per tax payer per year? I belive that the reason people really are after an offical language in this country is for the sake of assimilation. most people that i have heard talk about this dont even try to hide that, You are the first person i have heard come up with fincial thing. I really doubt that the const is significant.","zachvac","231139","I appoligize, I meant country, we were discussing the official US language, right? I'll do a little research and come with an estimate. But they have to pay for 911 operators in every language, ballots in every language, and everything else.","english-official-us-language","10:19 AM","government-debates","16"

However, since the government has willingly supplied corporations with slave labor, the least they could do is require corporations to fork over enough money to pay for bi-lingual signs and information. I mean, these people come here with little to no education in their own country let alone speaking English. You want English to remain the main language then vote out the bums that created this slave labor market here in the US is how I see it.","english-official-us-language","12:44 PM","government-debates","17"

"09-21-2006","8862",2,"None","None","None","Caprii","231803","This is how I look at it. Down with the weak, the strong ones always prevail. When the Engish came to the US area, they didn't speak Cherokee, out of respect to the natives. Indians were the weaker ones because they were out numbered and were a kinder breed of humans...stupid move on their part. Now US Americans (who are not kinder by the way) are becoming the native indians and the spanish speaking people are the new settlers, who largely come in peace, but like the English give no respect to the legal US Citizens and their laws. When spanish is the official language of the US 100 years from now, oh well,the stronger one always prevail. Can't blame them, because we are so stupid and weak when it comes to implementing and enforcing laws.","english-official-us-language","10:12 PM","government-debates","19"
"09-21-2006","8862",2,"None","None","None","GodIsDead","231812","It is such a hideous injustice for you to equate Spanish speaking people not learning English to the genocide of the Native Americans. This is not about pathetically resigning ourselves to injustices on the false and confused justification that it is some kind of natural fact. This is about the government trying to suppress a change of culture for no good reason.","english-official-us-language","11:56 PM","government-debates","20"

Viva La Raza!","Caprii","232430","I mention no color, only ""english"" ""cherokee"" and ""spanish"", you on the other hand mention ""white"" and I'm racist? Gotta luv it. Also, as convoluted as you think my post is (georged), is it not true? Is it true that there is strength in numbers? Is it true that most major businesses and U.S. goverments assist in english and ?, that's right...spanish. It's hardly a ""racist"" statement, but a fact, an occurring trend that the ""language-tide"" is turning. As for the fellow who posted after me. Language isn't the issue, communication is. We spend millions adjusting forms to reflect an additional language, we spend millions on hiring enterpreters, we spend millions hiring educators to teach English, so no matter how you slice it, we spend both ways, but I have a hunch we would spend much less if we could communicate more efficiently and effectively with one language. Personally, it doesn't matter to me which language, it could be pig latin for all I care. It's just silly, when people say its okay to come to America, be disrespectful and forget about using the dominant language, if all the immigrants did that, it would take twenty minutes to listen to the automated voice at the end of the phone line. ""Hello, for English press 1; Spanish press 2, French press 3, Chinese press 4, Japanese press 5, Russian press 6, German press 7; Arabic press 8, etc. Aren't we really being a ""racist"" america if we only cater to two groups, the english and speaking group? If we can't stick with one ""official"" language, then, to be fair to all citizens, we should assist all backgrounds in an equal manner. Oh well, people who don't see a problem, are the problem. America has become physically fat and mentally lazy. The most ""racist"" thing America can do is to continue the great divide. When people in America cannot communicate with their neighbor, then we are dividing not uniting. And you call me racist georged? I hand the ""racist hat"" over to you and sinjin. It fits you two better.","english-official-us-language","10:11 PM","government-debates","24"

When people can't communicate with their neighbor both are at fault. I'm struggling to understand how I've supported racism by advocating consideration of all citizens and residents regardless of their first language.
