You keep a uniform language which creates less misunderstandings. Con: You make a lot of people mad as we have a lot of people here that speak Spanish. You disrupt federalism in a way...not that this is a big con because we killled federalism awhile ago.","english-official-us-language","01:53 PM","government-debates","2"

But also note that there are individual states that have official languages, most of them English.","english-official-us-language","05:39 PM","government-debates","4"
"09-14-2006","8862",1,"None","None","None","GodIsDead","230954","Pro: if you are a white English speaking person, your race and your culture continues to dominate the general society. White supremacists get a big boost of confidence yes! America is finally officially, on paper, a white nation again. Next lets make Christianity our official religion since we cant afford to change all the stuff that says under god or in god we trust on it, and make male our official gender, since we cant afford to have all these extra bathrooms for women after all Con: All of the non-English speaking immigrants eternally have to try to get by in an English world stumbling with a second language and heavy accents that are a constant reminder to potential employers or investors that they arent somebody that they normally relate to socially. People who dont speak English for whatever reason (havent learned yet, have a hard time with languages, mentally retarded etc.) are out of luck if they have a medical emergency, or need to talk to the police. Also, these people wont be able to read legal forms or tax forms and may end up in jail. And most importantly, Cultures who speak different languages are discouraged from become a prominent part of American culture.","english-official-us-language","07:21 PM","government-debates","5"

He was responding to this: ""White supremacists get a big boost of confidence yes! America is finally officially, on paper, a white nation again."" Skin color and language have nothing to do with each other. Most hispanics I know can speak English. I have no problem with people based on their skin color. Religion is also irrelevant. I'm not a religious person (I would be classified as an agnostic, but again that's not important), but I speak English. You are claiming that making English the official language would make this a white or a Christian nation. There is no correlation.","english-official-us-language","11:56 PM","government-debates","8"

"09-15-2006","8862",1,"None","None","None","Steeeeve","231028","Most French speaking countries nations have ""white people""!!! That must mean if France makes their official language French than the whites will rule the day and make everyone a Christian and probably kill small children....oh wait...France already did that. Canada is even more screwed. They have two nation languages-English and French. I suppose they are double the white? Now I still think their is racism in the world but to think it comes out of people speaking another language....that is just insane. Stick to where the real racism is -- suburb soccor moms who drive SUVs.","english-official-us-language","09:56 AM","government-debates","11"

The majority of people in the world are white. Does that mean there is a correlation between humanity and whiteness? Again, I am white, but I'm far from a Christian. Although most whites do speak English, I would be willing to bet most Hispanics speak English as well. Ignoring the people who moved here after they were born, most people know English, regardless of what their parents speak. Is that racist? Are you not being more racist by claiming that whites have a monopoly on the English language or that Christians can only be white and that all whites are Christian (you don't outright say this but you sure imply it).","english-official-us-language","10:55 PM","government-debates","13"
"09-15-2006","8862",1,"None","None","None","GodIsDead","231122","wrong again zachvac, the majority of the people in the world are asian, not white. by a fairly considerable margin. look, i jsut dont really belive that it could really be that hard or that expensive to offer certan nessisary serveses in several languages. Honestly, how much dose it cost per tax payer per year? I belive that the reason people really are after an offical language in this country is for the sake of assimilation. most people that i have heard talk about this dont even try to hide that, You are the first person i have heard come up with fincial thing. I really doubt that the const is significant.","english-official-us-language","11:29 PM","government-debates","14"
