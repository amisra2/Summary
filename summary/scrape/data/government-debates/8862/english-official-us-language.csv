White supremacists get a big boost of confidence yes! America is finally officially, on paper, a white nation again. Next lets make Christianity our official religion since we cant afford to change all the stuff that says under god or in god we trust on it, and make male our official gender, since we cant afford to have all these extra bathrooms for women after all Con: All of the non-English speaking immigrants eternally have to try to get by in an English world stumbling with a second language and heavy accents that are a constant reminder to potential employers or investors that they arent somebody that they normally relate to socially. People who dont speak English for whatever reason (havent learned yet, have a hard time with languages, mentally retarded etc.) are out of luck if they have a medical emergency, or need to talk to the police. Also, these people wont be able to read legal forms or tax forms and may end up in jail.

Skin color and language have nothing to do with each other. Most hispanics I know can speak English. I have no problem with people based on their skin color. Religion is also irrelevant. I'm not a religious person (I would be classified as an agnostic, but again that's not important), but I speak English.

The majority of people in the world are white. Does that mean there is a correlation between humanity and whiteness? Again, I am white, but I'm far from a Christian.

Ignoring the people who moved here after they were born, most people know English, regardless of what their parents speak. Is that racist? Are you not being more racist by claiming that whites have a monopoly on the English language or that Christians can only be white and that all whites are Christian (you don't outright say this but you sure imply it).","english-official-us-language","10:55 PM","government-debates","13"

Also, as convoluted as you think my post is (georged), is it not true? Is it true that there is strength in numbers? Is it true that most major businesses and U.S. goverments assist in english and ?, that's right...spanish. It's hardly a ""racist"" statement, but a fact, an occurring trend that the ""language-tide"" is turning. As for the fellow who posted after me. Language isn't the issue, communication is. We spend millions adjusting forms to reflect an additional language, we spend millions on hiring enterpreters, we spend millions hiring educators to teach English, so no matter how you slice it, we spend both ways, but I have a hunch we would spend much less if we could communicate more efficiently and effectively with one language. Personally, it doesn't matter to me which language, it could be pig latin for all I care. It's just silly, when people say its okay to come to America, be disrespectful and forget about using the dominant language, if all the immigrants did that, it would take twenty minutes to listen to the automated voice at the end of the phone line. ""Hello, for English press 1; Spanish press 2, French press 3, Chinese press 4, Japanese press 5, Russian press 6, German press 7; Arabic press 8, etc. Aren't we really being a ""racist"" america if we only cater to two groups, the english and speaking group? If we can't stick with one ""official"" language, then, to be fair to all citizens, we should assist all backgrounds in an equal manner. Oh well, people who don't see a problem, are the problem. America has become physically fat and mentally lazy. The most ""racist"" thing America can do is to continue the great divide.
