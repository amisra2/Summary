Or if i get into a car crash on the freeway, i want to be able to communicate properly. Or, if someone else injures me by accident. I dont mind it inside of their little communities, but chances are, they dont spend their whole lives in that area, they travel occasionally.","georged","233224","Seems like a lot of undue effort spent learning a new language just in case of emergency. Those are accidents and abnormal incidents, not a part of normal life. Should an English speaker learn to speak Spanish if they're going to Miami, LA or or other city where 99% of the language spoken is Spanish?","english-official-us-language","04:08 PM","government-debates","31"

When I have to learn Spanish just to order a burger at the local Micky Dee's, that's a problem. Or when I'm trying to get some help at Wally World. So yes, I think that we need to establish a national language. ""Should an English speaker learn to speak Spanish if they're going to Miami, LA or or other city where 99% of the language spoken is Spanish?"" No, because LA is in California, which is in the US, and most of the US speaks English.","english-official-us-language","10:43 PM","government-debates","32"

Which means illegal aliens, and most of them only speak spanish.","english-official-us-language","01:36 PM","government-debates","36"

Which means illegal aliens, and most of them only speak spanish.","Baltidog","239405","The labor market is not free, that is why illegal businesses hire illegals so that their workers would report them to the regulatory agencies. For the most part illegal businesses are ignored and when they are caught they rarely received penalties that would discourage others from doing the same thing. The language of the illegal workers is a moot point, because the illegal businesses would gladly hire mute speakers if they were profitable and plentiful. Telling someone what language to speak is like telling them what video game console they must use. All Americans will be required to play their games on an Atari Jaguar since it is the only truly American made console. All them foreign games better learn to work on the Atari Jaguar or they will not be able to play in the good old USofA.","english-official-us-language","04:37 PM","government-debates","37"

Dialects are generally similar enough that you can understand a different dialect. For example, the English spoken in the US is a different dialect than that spoken in the UK, yet we can still easily understand each other.","english-official-us-language","08:36 PM","government-debates","40"

Many regional dialects are not understood by other dialects. Dialects have been identified as separate languages. While a Scotchman can be understood by a member of England's aristocracy, sometimes, China has different native languages.","english-official-us-language","08:50 PM","government-debates","41"

I really doubt that there are enough languages so that all 300 million of us can speak a different one. I am not going to force anyone to learn something, just beacuse I think it is a good idea.","english-official-us-language","10:22 AM","government-debates","43"
