Marx was the one that invented communism. I state ""Marxist Communism"" so it is clear that I am referring to the system and not the propaganda BS that Archie and you have fallen for. I could care less what the propagandists came up with for a definition on either side (the soviets or the US). They are of no consequence.","country-democracy-communist-merely-because-they-say-so","12:20 PM","government-debates","35"

"01-11-2009","12206",3,"None","None","None","Iuris","339865","Haven't we had this discussion before? If declare that the ""real communist"" countries were indeed communist, we must then also consider separately ""theoretical communism"", which has in that case never been tried and has almost nothing in common with the ""real communist"" practices. Otherwise, we use the term in an extremely broad sense, which will also allow other associations. Like associating Islam with terrorism (which some would like) or associating all the cruelty and abuses of the crusades and the inquisition with christianity (which the same some will deny). Communism was a proposed reaction to the observed abuses of unrestricted capitalism. Of course, as an idealistic theoretical model, it fails, since the people never measure up to the expectation. But then, so do democracy (tyranny of the majority and similar abuses of absolute democracy) and capitalism (14 hour work shifts, child labor, wages impossible to survive on,...). The one thing that everyone should remember, the one lesson everyone should learn from communism is this: it will happen again if we allow the circumstances that first brought it about to arise again.","country-democracy-communist-merely-because-they-say-so","05:21 PM","government-debates","37"

Of course they lost that bet. Big surprise.

"01-11-2009","12206",3,"gansao","339844","Now we are talking of 'Marxist Communism'. I think these goalposts are on wheels!","obvious_child","339890","Not at all. Unless we tied Communism to some fixed position, then there is no actual definition of Communism. This is exactly what Arch is trying to do. Instead of arguing what Marx wrote, he's trying to argue that Communism is whatever it is based on those who claimed themselves to be Communist. He's again pretending that the USSR didn't practice capitalism in the many secret military and scientist cities. Unless we peg Communism to a fixed point, it has no meaning.","country-democracy-communist-merely-because-they-say-so","09:37 PM","government-debates","42"
"01-11-2009","12206",3,"None","None","None","obvious_child","339892","Let's see: Communism is a socioeconomic structure and political ideology that promotes the establishment of an egalitarian, classless, stateless society based on common ownership and control of the means of production and property in general. Huh. Egalitarian? Only if you think the wide disparity between party members and everyone else is ""egalitarian"" Fail Classless? Only if you think that large stratifications by economic wealth is ""classless"" Fail Stateless Society? Massive government doesn't sound like ""stateless society"" to me. Fail Common Ownership? Of what? The average USSR citizen was dirt *** poor. Fail Control of the means of production and property? Considering that the USSR was controlled by a dictatorship rather then a democracy of the worker, the worker had no say in production and property. Fail. Let's rash: Unequal society? Check Classes? Check Massive Government? Check Unequal ownership rights? Check Centralized Dictatorship Control? Check That ain't Communism even as much as Arch would like to pretend it is. Then again, given how little he understands, he'd think that Somalia in the 1990s was Communist.","country-democracy-communist-merely-because-they-say-so","09:45 PM","government-debates","43"

By saying that if a country called itself Communism then that is Communism he is able to call any country Communist on extremely loose associations. If we applied his logic evenly, the US is a Communist country because we have a Communist party. Whether or not we actually are based on what Communism actually is, is independent of his argument. At this point the debate is pointless as words effectively have no meanings.","country-democracy-communist-merely-because-they-say-so","09:51 PM","government-debates","44"

No, the western world was involved in deliberate propaganda to make sure that failing totalitarian states were seen as communist, and any that actually tried to be communist were made to fail (particularly in south america). The ruling classes in the west have long had a goal of making socialism in general and communism in particular appear to be unworkable and even dangerous. This goes back at least a century to foundation of the UK labour party, and has found a particularly fertile soil in the US, as obvious child so clearly demonstrates. Writing off communism because of the USSR is like writing off democracy because of the failings of the Roman senate. Yet people are still naive enough to defend the principle of Marx over capitalism even though it has never worked in any form in which it has been tried..","obvious_child","339894","Incorrect. This was addressed in the first page. http://www.4forums.com/political/339770-post5.html You are using the short hand definition which has been applied to class, capitalist practicing, dictatorships that have been opposed to some Western ideas rather then what Communism actually is. What is amusing is that you keep pretending to know what Communism is yet you have for at least 20 times outright refused to answer my questions on some of the key criteria. Come again? Marx specifically stated that Communist countries would not engage in trade with the free world. The countries you call Communist did just that. The USSR exported significant amounts of marine products, particularly caviar to the world and in turn traded for large amounts of US grain. And the USSR specifically practiced capitalism in its military and science cities to motivate innovation. If a scientist managed to come up with something new, they got a fridge and extra freedoms. I still am amused how you keep thinking that Marx said that Communism was a class society, run by dictators with capitalism.","country-democracy-communist-merely-because-they-say-so","09:55 PM","government-debates","45"
