The Collapse of Communism Editor: Lee Edwards ISBN: 978-0-8179-9812-7 Pub Date: November 10, 1999 Product Format: Paper Availability: In stock. Price: $18.95 Qty: Ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and eight years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, experts continue to debate one of the most important political questions of the twentieth centurywhy did Communism collapse so suddenly? A comprehensive and often unexpected answer is provided in this unique volume of essays by the world's leading authorities on Communism. Presidential adviser Zbignew Brzezinski discusses the critical role of policymakers like Ronald Reagan, Mikhail Gorbachev, and John Paul II in the demise of Communism. Richard Pipes and Martin Malia debate the importance of history and ideology. Robert Conquest analyzes the deleterious impact of the Stalin years, and Michael Novak delineates the missing element of faith in Communism. Andrzej Brzeski exposes the fatal flaws of Communist economics; Brian Crozier discusses why there was a cold war. Paul Hollander concludes with a consideration of who in the academy was rightand wrongabout Communism. These insightful essays suggest that a wide range of forcespolitical, economic, strategic, and religiousalong with the indispensable role of the principled statesman and the brave dissident, brought about the collapse of Communism. The Collapse of Communism I INTRODUCTION Printer-friendly version of section Collapse of Communism, the disintegration of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) between 1989 and 1991. II CAUSES OF THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNISM Printer-friendly version of section The basic causes were economic stagnation, the rise of nationalist resistance to the ideology of communism, attempts to increase democracy, and changes in the international political environment. These factors were all interlinked and the Soviet leadership failed to devise a sequence of reforms that would enable it to sustain its rule. By the 1980s the Communist regimes were all coming close to economic stagnation, in part caused by enormous defence expenditures. The Star Wars initiative proposed by the United States president Ronald Reagan in 1983 threatened to provoke an arms race that would impose even greater burdens on people who had experienced improvements in their standard of living and wanted more. There had been earlier attempts in Eastern Europe at reforming the Communist system from within (1956 in Hungary (see Hungarian Revolution) and 1968 in Czechoslovakia (see Prague Spring), but these had been repressed by Soviet leaders who feared losing the buffer zone between the Soviet Union and the West that had been established after World War II. What had changed by the mid-1980s was the emergence in 1985 of Mikhail Gorbachev, representing a new political generation, as general-secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).

Former Communist Countries Museum of Communism ""Never again."" The tyranny and atrocities of Nazi Germany have been justly condemned by world opinion for over 50 years. But it is only recently that Communist despotism has begun to receive remotely similar attention. It would be a great tragedy if Communism disappeared from the earth without leaving behind an indelible memory of its horrors. Communism was not essentially about espionage, or power politics, or irreligion. Rather it was a grand theoretical synthesis of totalitarianism... a theory which millions of people experienced as the practice of murder and slavery. The roots of Communism lie squarely in the works of the philosopher Karl Marx. But at the same time, as we shall see, the tradition of Czarist absolutism also became an important source of Communist inspiration. The first exhibit to open explores the Marxist and Czarist origins of the Communist movement. Museum of Communism Chew on these and if you need more of an education I'll supply it to you.

There may be some examples but not many. Also I must point out that do not have any comment on this by OC: ' wouldn't say Communism is inherently impossible. It is just impossible with the current mindset of humans and most individualistic organisms' So does OC clearly demonstrate that a communist government is impossible or are you ignoring this very important part of OC's arguement.

To now use that term to define the whole political system is disingenuous and a misuse of of the term.

But if Marx based his original political philosophy on the 19th century Czarist form of ruling, and then Russia later built their form of Government based on Marx's Manifesto, we are seeing a circular route which leads to the Soviet version of Communism. No matter how you slice it, Soviet Communism was built from the Marxist philosophy which grew out of Marx's observation of the Czarist form of totalitarian rule.

When the Bolsheviks siezed power, the proportion of the Russian population that could be described as proletarian was barely 4%, Russia was not in any way the bourgeois state that Marx predicted would be subject to a communist revolution.

Russia was not subject to a proletarian revolution as described by Marx, the government had no mandate from the people and apart from a brief flirtation with the proper use of soviets (which were simply committees of workers who elected representatives to higher level bodies) was totally undemocratic.","country-democracy-communist-merely-because-they-say-so","10:02 AM","government-debates","27"

If declare that the ""real communist"" countries were indeed communist, we must then also consider separately ""theoretical communism"", which has in that case never been tried and has almost nothing in common with the ""real communist"" practices. Otherwise, we use the term in an extremely broad sense, which will also allow other associations. Like associating Islam with terrorism (which some would like) or associating all the cruelty and abuses of the crusades and the inquisition with christianity (which the same some will deny). Communism was a proposed reaction to the observed abuses of unrestricted capitalism. Of course, as an idealistic theoretical model, it fails, since the people never measure up to the expectation. But then, so do democracy (tyranny of the majority and similar abuses of absolute democracy) and capitalism (14 hour work shifts, child labor, wages impossible to survive on,...). The one thing that everyone should remember, the one lesson everyone should learn from communism is this: it will happen again if we allow the circumstances that first brought it about to arise again.","country-democracy-communist-merely-because-they-say-so","05:21 PM","government-debates","37"

No, the western world was involved in deliberate propaganda to make sure that failing totalitarian states were seen as communist, and any that actually tried to be communist were made to fail (particularly in south america). The ruling classes in the west have long had a goal of making socialism in general and communism in particular appear to be unworkable and even dangerous. This goes back at least a century to foundation of the UK labour party, and has found a particularly fertile soil in the US, as obvious child so clearly demonstrates. Writing off communism because of the USSR is like writing off democracy because of the failings of the Roman senate.

This was addressed in the first page. http://www.4forums.com/political/339770-post5.html You are using the short hand definition which has been applied to class, capitalist practicing, dictatorships that have been opposed to some Western ideas rather then what Communism actually is. What is amusing is that you keep pretending to know what Communism is yet you have for at least 20 times outright refused to answer my questions on some of the key criteria. Come again? Marx specifically stated that Communist countries would not engage in trade with the free world. The countries you call Communist did just that. The USSR exported significant amounts of marine products, particularly caviar to the world and in turn traded for large amounts of US grain. And the USSR specifically practiced capitalism in its military and science cities to motivate innovation. If a scientist managed to come up with something new, they got a fridge and extra freedoms. I still am amused how you keep thinking that Marx said that Communism was a class society, run by dictators with capitalism.","country-democracy-communist-merely-because-they-say-so","09:55 PM","government-debates","45"
