And once again, as usual, little childs thread premise is fallacious since none of my links (which he failed to post here in favor of a response to penfold) say anything about how the USSR referred to itself which isn't the issue at all. Although they also referred to themselves as Communists which he also ignores in his ridiculous insistence that they weren't Communist. I guess they were just trying to make points with folks even though soviet communism was the most feared political system of the 20th century, right? What is the issue that no authoritative, educated, or historically accurate source anywhere on Earth denies that the USSR was a Communist system of governing. And I posted more than 800,000 links which confirm that the collapse of communism - Google Search . But this simpleton still wants to make this about me. As if I'm alone in my claim. The fact is child, it's you who's alone in your claim and denial of history. Here's my previous post from the other thread. Blah, blah, blah... swallow some evidence and choke on your lies and bogus interpretation ot actual real world history. The Collapse of Communism Editor: Lee Edwards ISBN: 978-0-8179-9812-7 Pub Date: November 10, 1999 Product Format: Paper Availability: In stock. Price: $18.95 Qty: Ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall and eight years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, experts continue to debate one of the most important political questions of the twentieth centurywhy did Communism collapse so suddenly? A comprehensive and often unexpected answer is provided in this unique volume of essays by the world's leading authorities on Communism. Presidential adviser Zbignew Brzezinski discusses the critical role of policymakers like Ronald Reagan, Mikhail Gorbachev, and John Paul II in the demise of Communism. Richard Pipes and Martin Malia debate the importance of history and ideology. Robert Conquest analyzes the deleterious impact of the Stalin years, and Michael Novak delineates the missing element of faith in Communism. Andrzej Brzeski exposes the fatal flaws of Communist economics; Brian Crozier discusses why there was a cold war. Paul Hollander concludes with a consideration of who in the academy was rightand wrongabout Communism. These insightful essays suggest that a wide range of forcespolitical, economic, strategic, and religiousalong with the indispensable role of the principled statesman and the brave dissident, brought about the collapse of Communism. The Collapse of Communism I INTRODUCTION Printer-friendly version of section Collapse of Communism, the disintegration of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) between 1989 and 1991. II CAUSES OF THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNISM Printer-friendly version of section The basic causes were economic stagnation, the rise of nationalist resistance to the ideology of communism, attempts to increase democracy, and changes in the international political environment. These factors were all interlinked and the Soviet leadership failed to devise a sequence of reforms that would enable it to sustain its rule. By the 1980s the Communist regimes were all coming close to economic stagnation, in part caused by enormous defence expenditures. The Star Wars initiative proposed by the United States president Ronald Reagan in 1983 threatened to provoke an arms race that would impose even greater burdens on people who had experienced improvements in their standard of living and wanted more. There had been earlier attempts in Eastern Europe at reforming the Communist system from within (1956 in Hungary (see Hungarian Revolution) and 1968 in Czechoslovakia (see Prague Spring), but these had been repressed by Soviet leaders who feared losing the buffer zone between the Soviet Union and the West that had been established after World War II. What had changed by the mid-1980s was the emergence in 1985 of Mikhail Gorbachev, representing a new political generation, as general-secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU).

Former Communist Countries Museum of Communism ""Never again."" The tyranny and atrocities of Nazi Germany have been justly condemned by world opinion for over 50 years. But it is only recently that Communist despotism has begun to receive remotely similar attention. It would be a great tragedy if Communism disappeared from the earth without leaving behind an indelible memory of its horrors. Communism was not essentially about espionage, or power politics, or irreligion. Rather it was a grand theoretical synthesis of totalitarianism... a theory which millions of people experienced as the practice of murder and slavery. The roots of Communism lie squarely in the works of the philosopher Karl Marx. But at the same time, as we shall see, the tradition of Czarist absolutism also became an important source of Communist inspiration. The first exhibit to open explores the Marxist and Czarist origins of the Communist movement. Museum of Communism Chew on these and if you need more of an education I'll supply it to you. In other words, spew your garbage to the world at large and stop preaching your historical lies to me. http://www.4forums.com/political/cre...tml#post339755","country-democracy-communist-merely-because-they-say-so","06:15 PM","government-debates","6"

Are you ""denying"" here and now that the Soviet Union (USSR) who was a self declared and openly accepted (by the whole rest of the world) as a Communist Political System of governing its people?

I do not know of any budding South American 'communist' state that denounced the USSR as a not being communist. As a matter of fact the only state that I can recall that denounced the USSR was China. I do not recall Tony Benn denouncing the USSR as a totalitarian state not a communist state and I do not know of any left wing publications in England nor any Trade unions that have directly accused the USSR of being a totalitarian state and not a communist one. There may be some examples but not many. Also I must point out that do not have any comment on this by OC: ' wouldn't say Communism is inherently impossible. It is just impossible with the current mindset of humans and most individualistic organisms' So does OC clearly demonstrate that a communist government is impossible or are you ignoring this very important part of OC's arguement. The story of the Roman senate becoming a tool for a ruthless line of mad emperors is far nearer the story the failure of the USSR than any comparison to democracy","country-democracy-communist-merely-because-they-say-so","06:38 PM","government-debates","8"
