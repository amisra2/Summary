You had no problem here agreeing with me on another debate where I wasn't the one making the claim. http://www.4forums.com/political/cur...tml#post339019","Jo Bennett","339903","I just reviewed that thread, can't see the point you're making. In fact I make pretty much the same point, that being communist does not mean you support the totalitarian oppression carried out by the soviet union.","country-democracy-communist-merely-because-they-say-so","12:26 AM","government-debates","46"

Communism was never meant to be a totalitarian run by a few people. In fact the democracy of the worker as stated by Marx is the anti-thesis of what the Soviet Union turned out to be. But don't expect Arch to understand something that basic. Don't forget that Arch is trying to use a definition that classifies Communist as worshiping a God while being an atheist, trading with the West while not trading with the west, run by dictators and democracies, anti-capitalist yet practicing capitalism, having classes and yet being a class society. His definition makes the US Communist.","country-democracy-communist-merely-because-they-say-so","01:02 AM","government-debates","47"
"01-12-2009","12206",4,"obvious_child","339890","Not at all. Unless we tied Communism to some fixed position, then there is no actual definition of Communism. This is exactly what Arch is trying to do. Instead of arguing what Marx wrote, he's trying to argue that Communism is whatever it is based on those who claimed themselves to be Communist. He's again pretending that the USSR didn't practice capitalism in the many secret military and scientist cities. Unless we peg Communism to a fixed point, it has no meaning.","gansao","339908","Exactly , there is NO actual definition of communism because it has been used as a general term to describe Leninist, Stalinist, Moaist etc etc socialism . As this has been accepted as the generic term for that type of Government in the West it is up to you to redefine it! All you have to do is redefine it as Marxist communism and your argument would become much clearer. Are you saying that the USSR had seperate mini economies within cities created specifically for military bases and scientific research ?","country-democracy-communist-merely-because-they-say-so","07:04 AM","government-debates","48"

If we are to define Communist based on what so called Communists did, then we must call those who practice Democracies, Capitalism and Class Societies as ""Communist."" At that point it has absolutely no meaning as we can redefine it as we please based on whoever called themselves Communist. The PRC is a full blown capitalist free trading class society. Since Arch defined Communism as by what so called Communists did, then US is a Communist country. Insanely stupid, but that's Arch. Yes. And it worked relatively well, that coupled with threats of the gulag. If a scientist was able to come up with solutions or desired equipment, they got cars, fridges, bigger apartments, higher salaries, etc. That's a capitalistic reward system.","country-democracy-communist-merely-because-they-say-so","03:40 PM","government-debates","49"

So a system which rewards solutions with material goods is a capitalist system by default?","country-democracy-communist-merely-because-they-say-so","03:55 PM","government-debates","50"
