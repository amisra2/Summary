By your ""logic"" in the previous post, mine was entirely reasonable. If the USSR was communist because their party called themselves the communist party, then by logical extension North Korea is Democratic because their ruling party calls itself Democratic. Sorry if you don't like your own argument used against you, but that's what happens when you use such faulty BS 'logic'. Oh, and your first source is wrong - the current ruling party is not called the Korean Worker's party (the part you bolded).

Every single link I have posted regarding the Soviet political system, and the N Korean's for that matter, aren't Soviet or N Korean sites, but are independent sites which are reporting what their political systems were/are. In other words, according to any and every political scientist who has ever lived, the USSR was a communist political system. To deny that is to show that you deny long held, worldwide political history and reality. So this goes way beyond what they call themselves, although to any rational mind, that too would carry some weight. The reason for that is because they didn't just label their ruling political party the Communist Party for laughs SP, they acted like and upon the principles of Communism. This seems to be a fact you, Jo and child are in denial of. But hey, it isn't my job to force feed political history down your throats, or to teach you the historical truth regarding soviet communism and their imperialist hold over the Eastern Bloc States as they imposed this evil system of Governing on so many millions for so long. Wallow in your games of semantics and denial of history for all I care. Just stop acting like it's only me who is attempting to correct you rather than the objective historical sources I have posted.

So Bureaucratic Collectivism is just one bureaucracy which existed within the Communist Political System of Governing. To now use that term to define the whole political system is disingenuous and a misuse of of the term. And you know that to be true. communism [kom-yuh-niz-uhm] noun 1. a theory or system of social organization based on the holding of all property in common, actual ownership being ascribed to the community as a whole or to the state. 2. (often initial capital letter) a system of social organization in which all economic and social activity is controlled by a totalitarian state dominated by a single and self-perpetuating political party. 3. (initial capital letter) the principles and practices of the Communist party. 4. communalism. Notice the definition doesn't say Bureaucratic Collectivist anywhere. As I said to SP though, it isn't my job to get you to face historical reality. If you insist on denying what every political scientist on Earth takes for granted, in order to support an irrational poster, then that's fine with me. Just take it up with the 800,000 or so links in google which equate the USSR with communism and not me as I'm through restating the obvious for people who prefer denial to the truth.","country-democracy-communist-merely-because-they-say-so","08:28 AM","government-debates","23"
