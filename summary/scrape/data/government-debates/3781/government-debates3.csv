Maybe you could point a few of them out. True, he is enough of a realist to know that bad foreign policy for years has gotten us into the mess we are in today, but that shoudl hardly be news to anybody. Increased domestic spending? Increased taxes? Redistrobution of wealth? Are you nuts? george may be one of the most fiscally conservative people I have ever had the privelage of debating. He just moved states on the basis of controlled spending at the state and local level. Yes, like the president, who 10 years ago would have been considered a southern democrat. It is amazing to me how many ""conservatives"" are running around witht he false impression that Bush is a conservative and they somehow won something in the last election. I've got bad news for you, Clinton was more conservative than bush. Uncontrolled spending, huge deficits, and record increases in the size of governement are certianly a funny way to practice the supposed core values of the conservative party, which are fiscal responsibility and small government. If GW is what conservatives are now, what do you call folks like me and george, who advocate individual liberty, limited government, constitutional restraint fiscal responsibility and the minimal number of social programs required to keep starving, unwashed mobs from climing the wall in front of the house? I certainly don't think that ""far left"" fits the bill. Lets do a little test here.

"11-28-2004","3781",3,"marc9000","None","Well no, it's just that economics guys seem to like to make projections. After much meticulous detail, you always seem to stop short of making any projections about WHEN the U.S. economy will crash. Or the other doom and gloom that you predict, always with ""eventuallys"". Not an exact date of course, but wouldn't a window of a year or two be possible? So far, no matter what happens, no matter how good things go for the U.S., you can answer any question asked of you, about your previous posts, with another ""eventually"". You're really clever at blending your economic expertise with your far left political opinion. The more you post here, the easier it gets to tell where one stops, and the other one starts.","georged","79322","Far left political opinion? I've stated many times that my financial concerns are personally selfish and I don't mind paying reasonable taxes to keep the great unwashed at bay while labor costs seek a market level from supply and demand determined by 'legal' Americans, undocumented workers or off-shore labor pools. I dislike like government expansion at record rates and a 'volunteer' military raised by wages and benefits far exceeding those of entry level private industry with masses of contractors employed to keep 'military' numbers at politically acceptable levels. If we're going to use aggression as a foreign policy tool, use a draft supported or not supported by the voters to accomplish it, not deception. Your government promoted fear and blind adherence to their policies seems to have skewed your definitions of traditional political ideology. As to defining actual dates of detrimental financial 'events' tied to our economy, I've also stated many times that there are outside factors such as China's development time line, AQ and other undefined factors that make determination of specific dates, or years, impossible. I will restate that continuing to incur debt and maintaining trade imbalances that literally flog the dollar in a time of declining tax revenues is at the mercy of other nations who currently value our consumer markets and that will end when those markets are replaced by stronger economies such as China, India and other nations who will thrive using their realistic labor costs and positive cash flows. When Greenspan/The Fed, a political tool if there ever was one, sounds the alarm about debt and trade imbalance and the public doesn't even have a hiccup, it doesn't take many brain cells to understand that the public has been focused on fear using their God and a flag to survive. Most 12-year old kids know money has no god, flag or friends.","religious-war","09:47 AM","government-debates","34"

Or foreign policy continuing to fully support Israel's purge of Palestine and expansionist policy that invites another 9/11? Or continued expansion of conventional military power using crushing public debt when faced with an unconventional enemy constructed by our foreign policy? And the largest expansion of US federal government in our history using public debt during a time of reduced tax revenues, who's fault is that? Exploding state and municipal debt as the federal government reduces tax revenue sharing to polish federal numbers but pushes federal programs down the line complete with federal compliance measures and no funding? Gasoline prices that have doubled primarily due to our attempt to instill democracy in Iraq?

"11-28-2004","3781",3,"georged","None","I fully agree with the interest rate scenario, believing that only current administration efforts for re-election with tariff threats have staved it off this long. I notice the WTO is beginning to retaliate to attempted US isolationism for votes tariffs with some of their own penalties, specifically on steel. I wasn't aware of Russia's strategy and must say I applaud their fiscal resourcefulness. As Russia and former USSR states continue developing oil production, with China, other Asian nations and parts of Europe being primary beneficiaries of that production, it will put enourmous pressure on operating margins of some OPEC producers dependent on Chinese imports, to the point where the US could feel pressured to use aggression to maintain supplies purchased with dollars.

In general the normal Russians suffered greatly during the 90's which is also when the USD was basically the currency of choice in Russia, black markets used the dollar almost exclusively. I remember the new articles about the rush Russians had to change over their USD $20 note ( I believe this was the note) when the US changed it due to counterfitting. I expect that many Russians associate the US dollar with this period and prefer the Euro as a reaction to that. As for the government, I expect both. Much of Russia's trade is with Europe, and holding Euros as a reserve makes this trade easier. Then their is Putin's concern over the growing US presence in the Central Asian republics. As it stands the US has opened up a few bases in Kazakstan(sp) and is in fact sharing a base with Russia in one of those countries. Given the large projected amount of oil and gas in that region (not to mention the large and growing muslim population) I am sure Putin does not want the US to increase its influence in what I assume Putin feels is Russia backyard. I believe Putins recent comments about a new nuclear missile that can beat any defence system was meant to keep the US on its toes and to keep Russian generals happy.","religious-war","12:17 PM","government-debates","38"

The key position of the dollar is the fact that oil commerce is still primarily in dollars. If that continues to unravel, a dollar crisis will indeed be a fact, ballooning US public debt and trade imbalance to unmanageable levels.","religious-war","12:50 PM","government-debates","39"

The original topic of this thread, religion, will weight heavily in US efforts to pursue spreading democracy using a 'moral' platform acceptable to a majority of 51% or so, a pretty rickety platform without our former financial clout to keep the natives happy. China has no such restrictions. As I recall, China's plans include a goal of raising their annual per-capita income to $10k US, which is generally accepted as the point where China's domestic consumer products market can replace exports to the US with minimal production losses. I know Argentina's inflation was at 50% in 2002, but haven't followed their monetary policies since then. Maybe Chinese currency will eventually have the reserves to replace gold as a standard. Without a standard there's never going to be an end to politicians and bureaucrats spending public money by simply cranking up the printing presses until money supplies expand to a point of little value.","religious-war","01:56 PM","government-debates","42"

There have already been rumblings from both the Sauds and Kuwait about accepting the Euro for payment. The economics of this are simple. They currently accept the dollar for payment, but are forced to pay most of their expenses in Euros. I think more likely than a split payment system, the new standard for payments will most likely be set by OPEC, probably in the next 2 or 3 years, and almost certainly they will drop the dollar as their payment currency of choice. The dollar was originally selected becasue it was a stable, high value currency. With it dropping like a rock, they have no need to stick with it. Most of those who make up OPEC are concerned more with making money than with fostering brownie points with a faltering economic giant. Absolutly, if it has not already. China will not delink from the dollar until their annual income is high enough that their own consumer market can support their manufacturing base. Estimates seem to range from 2-5 years. Until then, I think we can expect to see both china and japan carry out cyclic grabs of the dollar in order to bouy up our economy, keeping their consumer market alive until it can be replaced. I am not sure you are right about it not being as severe. For one thing, I don't believe that argentenians carried the massive private debt that Americans do. Once our currenc is seperated from oil, and our consumer market is replaced, I think it is anybodies game, and how bad things get will largely depend on how gullible the American people are (which is not promising). I think a crash and burn of the real estate market is almost a sure thing, as interest rates rise, driving down the new home market, and a large percentage (likely the majority) of Americans discover that theya re upside down in their houses. As our national wealth evaporates the large industries that are left here, like the auto industry, will die off quickly as very few folks will have the resources available to spend $25,000+ on a new car or other high end consumer goods. The other major factor here is the people. While the people aof argentenia do not find living a third world lifestyle completely foreign to them, yuppie americans DO, and making the transition is likely to be incredibly difficult for them. As the middle class shrinks, and the vast majority of former middle class end up in the lower class (we don't have to wait to see this, it is already happening), there does seem to be the possibility of backlash against both our government and the wealthy. Americans are not used to having to dig through the trash, or pull their dinner out of a stream lest they and their families startve slowly. For those who have managed to put their money into investments not tied to faltering real estate or general equity markets, I recommend the Uzi. Small, maneuverable, and with enough heft to keep you on target, or use as a club after you have expended your magazine against the starving former yuppie scum who blame you, instead of their idiotic spending habits, for their demise.","religious-war","02:53 PM","government-debates","43"

As the USD falls the debtors in the US will generally only have to pay back in lower USD. Argentina has to find a way to pay back USD that were taken as loans at say 10 pesos to the dollar now they are at (not a real number) say 20 pesos to the dollar.

SA has already expelled themajority of our troops, and I personally don't see a war against the sauds being sucessful. They are the only ally we have in the ME with any real weight in the region (israel, but everybody hates them, a kind word form israel on our behalf pretty much gaurantees doom). I don't htink we would be willing to risk armed opposiotn in Saudi Arabia. Of ocurse, as we become more desperate to justify our massive military expenditures in order to polish our GDP numbers and keep some sembelance of a domestic economy going, who knows what kind of lu acy we may embark on? This is true and is a huge difference. I think the big question willll be whether it is enough of the a difference to offset the trillions in private debt that Americans are holding. I think we willl just have to wait and see on this one. This is another big difference, but it also begs a pretty serious question. While Argentina doesn't have nearly the international influence that America does, they also don't have the PR problem that we do. I think our PR problem is likely to intensify as we try ever more desperate measures to keep our economy moving. Using our military to mitigate negative impact from our poor spending habits is likely to be very unpopular. We are not the economic superpower we once were. We need the rest of the world a lot more than they need us. I think that with Europe consolidating into the EU, and asia and russia (and even canada to some extent) falling into line with the EU, it does not require much imagination to envision a scenario where the rest of the world, tired of the rumblings of a failing superpower, simply declare sanctions against the US and watch our population slowly starve to death. this is another of those wait and see things. If contries continue to jump on the EU bandwagon, and china continues their growth (which seems almost certian, as they are currently taking steps to restrain it), it will not be long before the US is a sidenote in economic discussions. This could be dangerous to the rest of the world. We have seen what happens when a nation with a huge military is not given the consideration they feel they deserve and their economy fails miserably (remember WWII??). While I would personally NEVER do anything which violated the weapons laws of any country, I do know a guy I could let you talk to. There are two ways to look at something like that. The canadian government does not like such weapons (truth be known, neither does the US government). Assault weapons and machine guns are very unpopular with the ruling class for obvious reasons. The question is, do laws against such things really discourage ownership? When I was in college, my freshman year I lived in a dorm that had an 11:00 curfew on weeknights. Every night from 11:00 to 3:00 somebody sat at the front door and took the names of everybody who came in, and apparently those who got caught breaking curfeww got into some kind of trouble (never bothered to read the book to see what happens to such folks). Now, there were two ways to look at this: 1. They wanted you in by 11:00 2. They wanted you to stay out past 3:00 I generally saw the second interpetation as the logical one. Laws banning high cap weapons and machine guns (what I generally refer to as ""fun guns"") can be viewed the same way. Obviously if you get caught with one, you are punished. And, again, obviously it should be fairly easy to catch people if they are out playing with their toy (a machine gun makes a distinctive noise, and whats the point of having a fun toy like that if you don't get to play with it?). So, there are 2 ways to look at this: 1. They are discouraging the use and ownership of machine guns/assault weapons/fun guns 2. They are encouraging the use of silencers. I will not tell you which interpetation I personally like better. You may be able to guess. I live in the US, where I can buy as many machine guns as I want, as long as I don't mind paying the $200 tax for them, and I can make them as long as I don't mind doing the licensing dance. The easiest way to do an Uzi in canda is probably to order a parts kit ($200) and have it mailed a few pieces at a time in a n unmarked package. I happen to know this will make it through customs. Then build your own reciever. They are easy to build. Then you have an unmarked throwdown toy to play with!","religious-war","04:03 PM","government-debates","45"
