"12-03-2004","3781",7,"daewoo","None","It seems we are fated for the same kind of ""shocking surprise"" when it comes to our economy and it is a damn shame. The indicators are all there. With the situation the economy is currently in, problems are not a possibility, they are a certainty. It is just a matter of when and how bad. By deluding the American public, the ""how bad"" is likely to be pretty damn bad. George, Gulfstream makes a nice business class jet and they are available on the used market at very reasonable rates. You can lease one even cheaper.","georged","80665","How our economic demise will progress is, IMO, a guess.

"12-04-2004","3781",7,"marc9000","None","That's a problem with the numbers game. If we have financial problems, and can't compare today's information of failure to yesterdays information of sucess, then it's harder to know what we're doing wrong. What do YOU do for a living? Kemp has had more than one job. Have you? I have. I'm currently a - Basic Resource Transfer Specialist (I run a dump truck). The hoops I have to jump through to keep it registered and insured would probably boggle the mind of a Chinese basic resource transfer specialist. He would probably be amazed at a couple of environmental stories I could tell also. But he's busy - it takes a lot of basic resources to build six cities the size of NYC. So he has traditional ways of figuring it, and you have new, progressive ways? And you're a conservative? I can't argue for Kemp. But I have never claimed that we don't have a problem. Your entire argument, and your numbers, show so much economical activity that involves ALL U.S. trade. Our involvement in Iraq is paid for by nothing but TAX dollars. I'd like to see figures on the activity of tax dollars only. How much the US government spends to run itself. You claimed that it doesn't matter how much is spent domestically - it stays in the country. ""It's not really the enemy, foriegn spending is. So in my recent post #73 which you seem to have forgotten about, in my company store example, you say it doesn't matter what percentage of company employees screw off? They get their paychecks and spend their money, that's all that matters? You still haven't made the case that ONLY foriegn spending is the problem. That we can't afford the Iraq war.","daewoo","80699","While we certainly can't look at numbers from Americas past, there have been antions that had similar figures as far as overall government spending, military spending, debt load, etc.... The closest is pre-WWII germany (before hyperinflation set in). The second closest, in terms of debt and government spending (not so much the military spendging ) is probably argentina from the above examples. This has never happened in America before, which is why it is so hard to make timeline based projections. This kind of thing has never happened on such a big scale. I own a small business that specializes in short run manufaturing and prototyping. I work 80-100 hours per week. I don't have time for more than one job. I understand what you are saying about government regulations, and particularly the EPA (BELIEVE ME, I would LOVE ot toss those guys up against the wall and shoot them). No, not new progressive ways. What I am saying is that you can't use 30 yr old economic models to make assumptions about todays economy because the data has changed so drastically. If you were to decide to apply for a loan today and were trying to decide whether you could afford it or not, you probably would noy pull out financial records from 5 years ago to do your calculations. If you were a Basic Resource Transfer Specialist 5 years ago and were making a salary in the same ballpark as you are today, it wouldn't be so bad. If you were the CEO of Enron 5 years ago, and are a Basic Resource Transfer Specialist today, your figures are going to be WAY off. This is effectively what a lot of people are doing. They are looking at old economic models to decide how much we can affrod to borrow and what the impact is likely to be on the economy as a whole. We know that back when the US was the worlds top producer and the top creditor nation on the planet, we could borrow x percent of our GDP and the economy would be fine. We knew that it was a sign of expansion int the economy. If we borrow that same percentage of GDP today, when we are running a huge trade deficit and our GDP is driven primarily by massive government spending and debt, it is a whole new ballgame. Sorry, I am not understaing exactly what you are after here. What I am saying about domestic spending not mattering much is in regards to bankrupting America, which is effectively what is happening with our trade deficits and foreign spending. It seems that you are alluding more to production figures here. Production figures are important, and failure in production is largely why we are in this mess, as are draconian governement regulation. Companies could no longer afford to keep up with the cost of government regulation and lazy american workers who demanded ever increasing compensation for their time. As a result, they either moved offshore or closed their doors. I certainly understand what you are saying as far as these things being a problem. I would even agree that these things were the drivng force behind our economic decline. Where is disagree is in that you seem to think that fixing these problems now will solve the problem overall. I think it is too late for that. There is simply too much damage and not enough money left to fix it. My prediction at this point would be that we are likely to see a major economic downturn in America in the next 3-7 years. I think it will likely be bad enough to make the great depression look like a bad recession. I would say we are likely to see both equity and real estate markets crash, or come close enough that the difference doesn't matter. I DO think that following this (and we will certainly pull out of it eventually), there will likely be something of a social revolution here. I think we are likely to see a major downturn in the liberal ideals. Hopefully people will learn that your companies cannot run if it costs trillions (nationally) per year to conform to feel good governemtn regulations. While I count myself as an environmentalist, I think our environmental policies need a major overhaul. While workplace safety is very important, I think we need to accept the fact that if you are going to have guys working in an industrial setting, some people are going to get hurt. The problem, from my point of view, is that our government has reached the point where they feel they need to stick their noses into everything. Everything is regulated, there are rules for evrything you can possibly think of. I think it was Eisenhower who said: ""If you want total security, go to prison. There you're fed, clothed, given medical care and so on. The only thing lacking... is freedom."" I don't know if you have ever traveled abroad, but if you do you might note that most places on the planet, the rulesa re a little more relaxed than they ae here. Tehre is not a regulation for everything. The cops are friendly, they don't particularly care to bust you for anything, they are just as likely to start a conversation with you because they think you look interesting. Speeding tickets in many countries are almost unheard of. This si not true in all countries, but it is in most I have visited and enjoyed. You spend a little time abroad then come back to the states and look around, and can't help asking yourself ""This is freedom?"" IMHO, the problem is not just public regulation, or regulation of corporate entities, the problem is individual regulation as well. I am starting to wonder if maybe it isn't time to pull out the guns (which we should all have) and toss some politicians against the wall and shoot them, simply so they understand that we REALLY want to be in charge and are more than a little tired of being dictated to. This is something I really have been wrestling with lately. I make a good living under the current system. But I hate the current system and really think it needs to be changed. I really thought that maybe Bush would be tossed out on his posterior NOT because the country is going more liberal, but becuase I really thought that maybe conservatives would be willing to send the message to the republican party that we are not willing to settle for a closet liberal. I thought that maybe enough conservatives were fed up with multi trillion dollar social programs and out of control federal spending and eroding personal freedom that we would be willing to endure 4 years of John Kerry to send the message that we WANT A DAMN CONSERVATIVE. Instead, we got 4 more years of Bush. So sad. The US has finite resources. We are loosing money every year. By spendign billions on an unneeded war, not to mention the billions in bribes and trade concession we gave to form our coalition of the ""willing"", we sent more of our limited, finite money out of the country.","religious-war","12:04 AM","government-debates","92"

As has been pointed out before (I think by you), every quarter point that interest goes up, a not insignificant portion of the marlet gets priced out of the game. One has to wonder....If our real estate market crashes liek that of Japan did a few years ago, will they show up with a big bag of gold to bail us out like we did for them? My father and ""the boys"" (myself and 2 brothers) bought a gulfstream a couple years ago. It was an asset of a corporation we purchased jointly and liquidated. It is very nice to be able to fly from point A to point B without having to go through the whole security mess. You walk out to the plane, get in and go. There are generally no metal detectors, body cavity searches, or restrictions on the number of books of matches you can bring on board. Nobody asks to see your papers, and as far as I know, it doesn't matter whether we are on the ""no fly"" list or not (I doubt any of us are on it). That does bring up a curious question in regards to security. What exactly is keeping us from loading the plane with explosives and flying it into a building? Unless there is some pretty serious security going on that I have never noticed, nothing is keeping us from becoming terrorists and going out in a blaze of glory (except for sommon sense, of course). We have been known to deviate from our flight plan by 3 states and nobody ever says anything.","religious-war","12:18 AM","government-debates","93"
"12-04-2004","3781",7,"None","None","None","georged","80737","I'm saying how rapidly any of those scenarios develop, and they will all develop, is what will determine the speed of our continued economic demise. We've antagonized the international community to such an extent that the only assistance we're going to receive from other countries is continued purchase of our treasury issues to keep the government afloat until we're no longer needed as an end market for their production capacity. Even with the collapse of the real estate bubble we're a huge economy and a great number of people will retain their wealth to continue providing a negative trade balance. An AQ attack is a different scenario. That would be an opportunity for the government to expand the military effort, which would replace the transactions lost to commerce from an attack with additional public debt. How long we can keep our public facade of financial well-being, regardless of how and when detrimental events occur, is the only real question. I left the Corporate world as an officer in 1986. At that time the company I was with had a Canadair Challenger (CEO's aircraft), A Falcon 50 and two Lear 35s at the corporate level. As a cost example, I financed the Challenger for $20.5-million. Operating cost, pilot, fuel and maintenance without debt service, was $800/hr. Not too many companies could afford that, even in that era, but anyone who has ever experienced the convenience of general aviation travel would do it again without cost justification. As our general counsel stated on the side when offering the legal opinion for board approval of the debt (few people realize even a CEO has a somewhat low spending approval number, that most large expenditures require a corporate resolution blessed by the board), if the company flourishes no one will notice. If it fails, so what? In this era of commercial airport security nonsense, I'd think any corporate officer worth his/her salt has private aircraft.","religious-war","10:14 AM","government-debates","94"
"12-04-2004","3781",7,"marc9000","None","I'm talking about separating domestic spending blame from foriegn spending blame, and finding solutions. If we could see some TAX figures only, - numbers showing how much tax money has been collected and spent over the years, I think you guys would have a harder time convincing anyone that running from our enemies, and continuing to perform multi million dollar environmental impact studies, is not a solution.","georged","80743","A majority of those studies are a simple matter of public entities evading infra-structure improvements to facilitate commerce because they simply don't have the money. Spending a few million of someone else's money for the studies instead of shelling out billions they don't have. Up until about 1995, states and counties all over the US were using tax breaks, normally in the form of waived property and infra-structure taxes, to attract new industry. Those politicians were using 'new jobs' for voter approval, especially in closely contested election areas. The downside was, and is, that existing taxpayers were burdened with with the improvements and increased, ongoing deterioration of services with no additional tax revenue. All for some $10/hr jobs with profits leaving the US. Among many others, foreign vehicle manufacturers exploited that opportunity to the max, building US assembly plants to service this market using tax concessions and eliminating freight that immediately increased their profitability. For tax numbers all you have to do is look at past annual US budgets and deficits. Budget less deficit equals tax revenue. If you like to dig, both the IRS and Treasury departments have that info. If you're really a glutton for punishment, Treasury has the actual spending allocated by department. What we spend on our military out of those budgets and what that achieves is the real consideration. Spending more than the next 25 or so world countries combined seems a little out of whack. This site has been running their charts for a few years. While I don't support the site or their motivation, they are convenient: http://www.warresisters.org/piechart.htm I don't think anyone advocates running from our enemies. To me, how we arrived at having enemies is the issue. Our constitution states defense. Our gunboat diplomacy has always been there, but we've really strayed far from that use of 'defense' funds over the past 50-years and it all adds up. AQ is simple, our unrestricted support of Israel being the only real issue. We continue supporting Israel's policies equals increased hatred and probable attacks from AQ. Iraq is self-explanatory, colonization for purposes of a ME military presence and controlling their natural resource. Do we want those enemies? That seems to be the foreign policy we've followed for decades, turning up the heat to direct intervention with Iraq. What are the gains versus the expense of incurring those enemies? None that I can see. We can buy oil at market prices for far less money than 'spreading democracy'. Why not declare Israel a state or let them go and get everything out in the open? Too many interested parties throwing money at US administration has created a powerful, silent, behind the scenes government. I don't see any solutions other than our economic demise.

Wondering if you've ever experienced our type of airport security, only in a lot more places, like banks and shopping centers. No, I haven't traveled to speak of. Briefly to Canada once. Defence is more than just waiting to be attacked. Nothing but predictable reaction from us helps the enemy to plan. Supporting Israel, encouraging democracy is conservatism. Maintaining that certain cultures are better off without democracy, is liberalism. I've heard that the U.S. NEVER DID have the natural resources of Africa, or South America. IMHO America didn't become great because of natural resources. A good constitutional foundation and good, diverse people made it great.","daewoo","80859","Sure, the numbers are available, the pattern just doesn't fit anymore. Domestic spending is not going to cause trade deficits. We spend 18 million on some idiotic environmental study, that money goes primarily to pay researchers to carry out the study. They take that money and use it to buy stuff. In theory the money should end up in the poscket of manufacturers, who use it to pay their employees, who buy more stuff. It is a big cycle. The problem with the trade deficit is that Aemrican manufaturing is all but dead. Now people buy stuff and it ends up in some chinese manufacturers pocket. Yep, thats pretty much it. Yes and no. It is really too late for these things. It is only massive government spending, mostly debt drvien, that is keeping our economy running at all. Without it, at this point, we are sunk. The money needs to stay IN THE US, though. I am an avid hunter and outdoorsman. It is almost impossible to be a hunter and not an environmentalist to some extent. I want for there to be something left for my kids to enjoy. Unfortunatly a lot of the current environmental polices are the result of fanatics screeching very loundly as opposed to common sense environmental protection measures. Americans visit the tourist traps generally. If you get past the tourist traps, there is a lot out there worth seeing. Americans, as a rule, do not travel. This is unfortuante as there is a lot out there worth seeing. Yes, I have been to israel. Nasty little racist, fascist country. I would suggest staying away unless you happen to be jewish, in which case you should probably move there and live the rest of your life on the US taxpayers dime. I am going to jump to another post real quick. Israel is the biggest welfare state on the planet. Without massive amounts of US aid, israel would collapse in less than 3 months. They have no real industrial infrastructure, nobody on the planet is willing to do business with them, and they survive only by leaching onto the US and pulling billions per year in aid from us. How is supporting this ""conservative""? Conservatives traditionally are not big fans of welfare. How is supporting an entire nation conservative? If not for the lumber, light mining and fur markets, America wouldn't have survived throught he first year. While it is certainly possible that S America and Africa have more by way of natural resources than America, we had more usefull resources, and resources that were more easily exploitable. While there are certianly vast stands of timber in S America, they are generally not the traditional hardwoods and straight pine that were big sellers on the european market. They have no furbearers that reach prime (becuase it never gets cold) and their mineral deposits are generally more difficult to mine. If you look at some of the early exports from america, I ron ore was a big one. Unlike in S America or Africa where it must be mined, in America we were literally just picking it up off the ground. There are also overland transport problems when it comes to Africa or S America. Cutting a road through the jungle was certainly not a simple matter. It was not until the french, Germans, and British drive railroads through Africa that the natural resources there had any real value at all.","religious-war","12:42 AM","government-debates","99"

I'd like to see all that broken down. But I'd like to see what that pie looked like 40 years ago. I'd like to see things like ratios of government employees to population - federal and for each state. For today, and 40 years ago. Government income for nothing but gasoline tax, today and 40 years ago - federal and for each state. The cost of one mile of interstate today and 40 years ago. Federal spending for pork (museums, halls of fame, municipal swimming pools, etc.) today and 40 years ago. A breakdown of federal and state spending for education, today and 40 years ago. Simple comparisons of federal spending of the past, with today's spending, that a human can understand.

What most people are unable, or unwilling to accept is that they don't apply to our circumstances over the past 15-20 years. From post WW11 until the '70s we literally controlled most world markets and were king of the industrial mountain. That provided a constant influx of new wealth into our country and contributed to our current dilemma, a standard of living that became so high, accompanied by shoddy product quality, that our products were eventually unable to compete in world markets. One could compare 2004 to 1964 all day long and still have apples to oranges. In the past few years, due to our migration from industrial to service economy, our tax revenue has dropped while our expenses keep going up at a far faster rate than we can afford, so we keep borrowing money to bridge the difference. Forget political loyalties, both parties have been equally fond of spending public money in their quests for popularity. To place our problems on either of the two main, very similar political parties is like a schoolboy blaming everyone else for bad grades. Voters keep approving our government policies, which lays the blame directly at our feet. The question asked by our creditor nations, the rest of the developed world and myself, is why the US continues to live like a plantation owner after the civil war in that our lifestyle continues at a pre-war level while the plantation decays at a rapid rate. We all know the answer, the US system of government is such that our politicians use borrowed public money to convince the voters that everything is fine, we're just going through a rough patch, and we're still the mightiest nation on the face of the earth. If you don't accept that and continue to finance our drunken spending, we'll use our high priced, low casualty, humanitarian military to ruin your day by putting that exercise on the national credit card. Blaming liberal or conservative administrations for our problems has no basis. We now have a questionably conservative administration in place, and under that label we're spending, borrowing and expanding government more than any democratic administration ever dreamed of. The fact of the matter is that the general US public is dumb as a post in that like our government, they live their personal lives in a similar manner with no reserves and debt beyond their capability to retire. With an economy bordering on 85% of GDP based on consumer and public spending from debt, with national wealth leaving the country as fast as we can consume imported goods, circumstances have reached the point of a Satchel Page statement, 'Don't look back because something bad might be gaining on you'.

The only difference I can see between Israel and the US now is that in Israel it was common to see Uzis at cafe tables and being carried on the streets and we still virtually support their economy and military efforts.

One is that all that military junk gets stockpiled, essentially removing that wealth from the economy, until such a time that we ship it off to another nation where it gets blown up. We haven't used our military to defend America for years. It is simply a tool of foreign policy. The money we spend on our military is effectively little more than foreign aid. while a small percentage is actually connected tot he defense of America, the majority is not. I would certainly agree that a strong defense is needed. The ability to protect the US and its posessions is very important. The ability to invade third world countries based on some idiotic ideaology is not. While the former is what makes america strong, the latter has been weakening America for years. What does the war in Iraq have to do with terrorism? We are under attack by terrorists because of our support of Israels expansionist policies, our meddling in the affairs of other nations, and our use of our military as a tool of foreig policy. Since the war in Iraq started, we have not killed or captured a single confiremd member of Al queda there. We have not found any WMD's that the UN inspectors had not already found and tagged for destruction. There is NO CONNECTION between the war in Iraq and the wqar on terror save one. The war in Iraq has ignited anti US sentiment around the world. As a direct result, AQ has more than tripled in size. In addition, the MAJORITY of the worlds nations have formally refused to aid us in our war on terror lacking a specific charge (they are no longer rounding up AQ members simply for being members of AQ, they are demanding proof of a crime). Frankly, if we don't change our foreign policy, we may well end up like israel, besieged in our own nation. Keep in mind that the cell system the terrorists are using was developed by the reagan era CIA specifically to be undefeatable. They are using our undefeatable system against us, and there is not a thing we can really do about it. This is another area where olod models do not hold up. Traditionally you would deal with such an organisation by infiltrating it. The cell based system was specifically designed to thwart such attempts since nobody on any level knows enough to provide good intelligence to a single mole, and the odds of getting enough moles into such a tight system are slim to say the least. When you are operating in cells of 3-5 people, you are working with guys you know and have known for years. The ""new guy"" who shows up and wants in uninvited is sure to raise suspicion. It was not actually ther security that I found so distrubing about israel. It was the openly racist policies and prominent encouragement to violence by the Israeli government. I went there with the impression that the palestenians were our enemy. I came fairly quickly to the realisation that while the Israelis may be our allies on paper, they absolutly spit in the face of everything we are supposed to stand for (liberty, justice, freedom, etc...).","religious-war","01:04 PM","government-debates","103"

You've said earlier that it's too late to do anything about impending doom, yet you now ask ""why the US continues to live like a plantation owner"", as the ""plantation decays"". We stop the decay by cutting and running in Iraq and abandoning Israel, or by cleaning up our over regulated house? If we would GET STARTED on trimming the 40 year built up fat in our backyard, it may not be long before there would be new room on the credit card for our military. But not all accumlated past Democratic administrations, and Democratic congresses. But our Republican-since-94 congress could do better. The institution has been too corrupt for too long. Term limits and a president with a line item veto would be a start. Thanks to, not 40, but about 70 years of liberalism, which doesn't encourage people to be responsible.
