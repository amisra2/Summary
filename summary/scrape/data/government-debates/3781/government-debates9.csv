Dono","daewoo","81954","I don't think this passage necessarily lays down ""seperation of church and state"" as it has been interpeted by many. while i think this certainly would prhibit a school from requiring their students to pray, it seems that the far left crowd out there has interpeted this to mean that any reference to religion by the governemnt is taboo. This certianly was not the intent of those who wrote the constitution. The anti-religous nuts have gone WAY off the deep end with this when they are suing because they are upset about the word ""god"" in the pledge of allegience, or when the ACLU sues to have a cross removed fromt he city seal of podunk, wisconsin, despite the fact that nobody local had complained about it.","religious-war","10:13 PM","government-debates","121"

Using those same tactics, two Florida lawyers made a tour of the entire state of Florida by car, photographing every business that didn't comply with handicap access (ramps) to their buildings, federal legislation. They then filed a class action lawsuit against every business that was documented as out of compliance. Over 90% of the liability insurance carriers for those businesses settled with the lawyers, opting to avoid substantially greater loss in the courtroom. Who can afford to fight federal legislation? While both actions can be viewed as distasteful and perhaps unnecessary, any public that approves political decisions such as Iraq being accomplished as God's Will, as we're currently being spoon fed, allows both to be viewed as retaliation to a federal government that is shredding our constitutional rights using god and country as a rationale for greater control over the public and for purposes of nation building. There's not really much difference in Islamic and US terrorism other than geographical location when a mythological god is used as a leader. Peyote, as used by some belief systems, couldn't provide a more distorted rationalization than our leadership accomplishes with god.","religious-war","10:30 AM","government-debates","123"

The city seal issue was in a town of less than 2000 people, and they had been using that same seal for over 100 years. It wasn't hurting anybody, and when the city did a poll on the issue (when you have few than 2000 people you can put up a sheet in the grocery store and poll evewrybody), there was not a single local who was for changing the seal. The ACLU, with a history of getting federal court rulings against anything even remotely connected to God in any government was simply fighting an idealogical battle simply for the sake of fighting it. they used the federal court system as a weapon to advance their ideals and force them upon an unsuspecting group of small town folks. This is the problem. NOBODY can afford to fight federal legislation. Even corporations don't try anymore. When legislation gets passed that they find distasteful or inconvenient, it is cheaper for them to buy their own congressmen and get it changed than it is to actually fight it. Long gone are the days when we could expect any form of justice. Even if you go to court and win, it is likely to cost you tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars to do so, and God help you if you have to pay for appeals. Personally, I find this extremely troublesome. When you effectively tie your legal system into such knots that a man cannot walk into court, tell his story, and expect justice, there is no justice. When you have activists judges who serve not based on the law, but based on loyalty to their particular political party, thre is certainly no justice there. But neither of these are retaliation to the federal governement. Both of these are actions by people who wish to use the governemtn to control peoples personal actions and deny personal freedoms.","religious-war","11:09 AM","government-debates","124"

Philosophically, not unlike Native Americans using gambling under the sovereignty clause to recover some of their physical property taken by the government (government being the US public voting majority that, like Iraq, approved of geographical expansion using aggression). Aside from the Native American issue, I'm not condoning either example, just pointing out that people are using the legal system to satisfy individual desires, which means the system as a whole is morally corrupt and not serving the individual with justice.","religious-war","11:29 AM","government-debates","125"

I think this is an important aspect of morality commonly accepted by the US public. The invasion/occupation of Iraq is now routinely referred to as a humanitarian gesture with religious overtones by including it in the 'War on Terror' image and 'The Will of God' crusader talk. To me, I can't see much difference between that rationalization and our courts awarding someone millions of dollars for spilling hot coffeee in their own lap. We have some real problems with government taking on the role of determining morality and acceptance of same by the general public that will cost us dearly down the road.","religious-war","07:22 PM","government-debates","128"
