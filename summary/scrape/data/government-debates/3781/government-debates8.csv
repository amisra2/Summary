"12-05-2004","3781",8,"georged","None","Islamic retaliation against us is a direct result of our support of Israeli policies I've been there, more than 20-years ago, and every bag was opened and searched at the airport while people of Palestinian/Arabic ancestry and obvious foreigners were treated like blacks in the US circa 1950. The only difference I can see between Israel and the US now is that in Israel it was common to see Uzis at cafe tables and being carried on the streets and we still virtually support their economy and military efforts. Due cause has also been eliminated from our constitutional rights. Why not blame 'terrorism' for what it is, a circumstance of our own efforts?","marc9000","80953","The topic of this thread is ""religious war"". Nice to have the opportunity to use those words. I believe it is only somewhat religious. Extreme Muslims believe it their duty to kill non Muslims. (Americans and Jews) Many Arabs are simply jealous of U.S. and Israel's sucess. Both those have nothing to do with America's support of Israel. If you would STOOP SO LOW to turn on a television or listen to some AM radio, you'd realize that it's LIBERAL to blame America's support of Israel, (blame America first) and it's CONSERVATIVE to blame our enemies jealousy, or their anti American religious beliefs.","religious-war","08:15 PM","government-debates","106"
"12-05-2004","3781",8,"daewoo","None","Two problems with that scenario. One is that all that military junk gets stockpiled, essentially removing that wealth from the economy, until such a time that we ship it off to another nation where it gets blown up. We haven't used our military to defend America for years. It is simply a tool of foreign policy. The money we spend on our military is effectively little more than foreign aid. while a small percentage is actually connected tot he defense of America, the majority is not. I would certainly agree that a strong defense is needed. The ability to protect the US and its posessions is very important. The ability to invade third world countries based on some idiotic ideaology is not. While the former is what makes america strong, the latter has been weakening America for years. What does the war in Iraq have to do with terrorism? We are under attack by terrorists because of our support of Israels expansionist policies, our meddling in the affairs of other nations, and our use of our military as a tool of foreig policy. Since the war in Iraq started, we have not killed or captured a single confiremd member of Al queda there. We have not found any WMD's that the UN inspectors had not already found and tagged for destruction. There is NO CONNECTION between the war in Iraq and the wqar on terror save one. The war in Iraq has ignited anti US sentiment around the world. As a direct result, AQ has more than tripled in size. In addition, the MAJORITY of the worlds nations have formally refused to aid us in our war on terror lacking a specific charge (they are no longer rounding up AQ members simply for being members of AQ, they are demanding proof of a crime). Frankly, if we don't change our foreign policy, we may well end up like israel, besieged in our own nation. Keep in mind that the cell system the terrorists are using was developed by the reagan era CIA specifically to be undefeatable. They are using our undefeatable system against us, and there is not a thing we can really do about it. This is another area where olod models do not hold up. Traditionally you would deal with such an organisation by infiltrating it. The cell based system was specifically designed to thwart such attempts since nobody on any level knows enough to provide good intelligence to a single mole, and the odds of getting enough moles into such a tight system are slim to say the least. When you are operating in cells of 3-5 people, you are working with guys you know and have known for years. The ""new guy"" who shows up and wants in uninvited is sure to raise suspicion. It was not actually ther security that I found so distrubing about israel. It was the openly racist policies and prominent encouragement to violence by the Israeli government. I went there with the impression that the palestenians were our enemy. I came fairly quickly to the realisation that while the Israelis may be our allies on paper, they absolutly spit in the face of everything we are supposed to stand for (liberty, justice, freedom, etc...).","marc9000","80956","That doesn't waste money one bit worse than wasting it in our own country. Even if it ""stays in the country"" as you say, it's WASTED just the same.

It is still in the country, though, which means it does not contribute to our imminent bankruptcy. If that is the case, the liberal is right and the conservative is a liar. The war in Iraq had nothing to do with terrorism. saddam was not tied to AQ. This is not something we have learned since the war. We knew it before. People still trying to draw some kind of ghost parralel between the two are either XXXXXX or liars, including any mainstream conservative congressman who wants to try to convice people that the lie is anything but that. If being a conservative means you have to be delusional, be willing to not only say that 2+2=5, but stand up and argue the point, I want no part in it.","religious-war","09:40 PM","government-debates","108"

She was commenting outside her field, though, and they just let her ramble on as if she had some kind of idea what she was talking about. Cavuto is a sharp guy, he knows better. He knew she was talking out her back end, and should have said something. She was telling the story that people wanted to hear, though, so they let it go. Cavuto is not on CNN. He is on fox. I don't watch CNN, too far left. I generally prefer not to watch fox....too far right. I think that MSNBC is pretty good. They tend to cover a little of both sides, but then if you want more perspectiv eont he fascist viewpoint you can change to fox, and if you want to seee what the commies think, you can check out CNN. I do like to watch Hannity anc Combs sometimes, just becuase I love to hate Sean Hannity. He is an arrogant jerk. I think he actually believes that he is somehow ""beating"" the people who come on the show that disagree with him. In reality he just yells over them and doesn't allow them to say anything. I liked the one where he was talking to Wesely Clark and Clark pretty much shook him like a rag doll and pulled his stuffing out. I also like O'reilley. He is another arrogant jerk, but he has interesting stroies and many times, I think, an excellent viewpoint. What bothers me about O'reilley is he has this really nasty tendancy to believe he is speaking for all americans. He has this really nasty habit of telling folks ""If you do that, there WILL be a boycott"" or ""If you try that soldier, the american public WILL protest"". I think that he is pretty seriously overestimateing the influence he has with the american public. True enough. Personally, not a big fan of jennings.

There was one particularly annoying time he did this while discussing US soldiers defecting to canda. He told the canadian lady that was his guest on the show that ""If the canadian government does not return these guys, I am telling you there WILL BE a boycott on canadian good in this country"". From a practical standpoint that is, of course, rediculous. Maybe he is just counting ont he fact that Americans have the attention span of a gerbil and that the minute events stop being reported on the mainstream news, they cease to exist. I didn't see anything about it on MSNBC or FOX tonight either. Both stations covered the stupid steroids in baseball controversy, though. It seems that we currently are trying to focus the attention of Americans at external enemies instead of drawing attention to fringe movements right here at home. I guess I can kind of understand this, with so many Americans disenfranchised by their government. There was a series of reports on MSNBC a while back about American militia groups. It was (IIRC) 3 nights. In the 2 weeks following these reports, membership in such groups increased by 30%. They were certianly not portrayed in a flattering light on the news, but it seems that there are plenty of Americans out there who feel that some pretty serious changes need to be made in regards to our government. To put this in perspective, using 2000 numbers, that is 9 million new militia members in the course of 2 weeks.- If you look at foxes numbers, though, they are not. News stations int eh US enjoy pretty pathetic ratings compared to other countries. AJ tunes in more people on a daily basis that the superbowl. The voter turnout in the last election had little to do with voter knowledge and a lot to do with the strategies of the canidates. Both sides workd VERY hard to send the message that if the other guy was elected, it would be the end of the free world. People actualyl bought this. From a practical standpoint,t he 2 canidates were running on identical platforms. For months I challenged folks here to explain to me the major differences between the 2 platforms, and nobody was able to. While there were definate small differences between the two, there was no decisive difference big enough to win votes or ignite passions. I can only imagine that most people picked their canidates name from a hat, or based on party loyalty. The election itself was little more than a smear campaign based almost entirely m y misinformation about the opposing cnaidates viewpoints. It was amazing to me how many rabid Bush supporters were anti kerry because he ""was going to raise taxes for the middle class"". No, he wasn't. In fact, if one bothred to visit his web page, they would find that he planned to LOWER taxes for the middle class. This is just one of many examples. I still have trouble believeing that people are paying attention when less than a year ago, 40% of the coutnry thought that Osama Bin Laden was the president of Iraq, and Saddam was an active member of Al Queda.
