Look at the actions of certain nations vs certain religous and ethnic groups. Read with an open mind Ossama bin Laden Fatawa(sp) from 1998 or their abouts. Then think about how you would feel if The USSR came to America, set up puppet governments, placed troops in DC and generally treated you as a second class citizen in your own land. Then compare that to what has occured in the ME over the last 140 years and you might get a reason why they dislike the US and UK so. France seems to have been forgiven, except by maybe the Algerians.","religious-war","09:29 PM","government-debates","5"

Oil just grew it bigger. Only the puppet ME dictators England helped establish after WW11 thought well of America or England. We assisted them, including Saddam after he came to power, until the Gulf War, in maintaining what would be considered by American standards oppressive control over their populations to get their oil. The Sauds and a couple of others are still in place, primarily due to our supplying them with ongoing military materials and training to remain in power. Israel was put in place and supported by the US as a wedge against those ME countries backed by Russia, formerly by Nazi Germany, during and immediately following WW11 and throughout the cold war. If Saddam hadn't been seriously leaning towards accepting Euros for his black market oil instead of dollars, before the invasion he was supplying 3% of our crude through the spot market, he'd probably still be in power.","religious-war","10:28 AM","government-debates","7"

Or was it hitler talking to Bush.","Mach","78872","Maybe. But polarizing the masses with talk of good and evil is a common ploy of those in power, no matter the time or place. Religion is the easiest avenue to that in the U.S. since a huge portion of the population is religious. If you think the war itself is motivated for religious reasons, I think that's short-sighted. This war is probably as you say, about power (and thus money), and war itself, as a way to demonstrate to the world that the U.S. is still the superpower, and will use deadly force to enforce it's wants and needs. -Mach","religious-war","08:34 PM","government-debates","8"

So to keep them from thinking they could do it again with stronger weapons, we attacked them. Plain and simple. What do people think is a logical reason to go to war? Should we wait until they wipe out a section of the United States or invade the U.S.? In short, the real question is whether or not we fight our enemies pre-emptively, or reactively.","religious-war","08:07 PM","government-debates","9"

Or why we attacked Iraq, who had no relationship with AQ or WMDs? Or our economic circumstances prior to invading Iraq and the temporary economic/political solutions that provided? Or that this is not a conventional war where military supremacy is the key factor, but an economic struggle? Have you calculated the economic and physical damage created by 9/11/Iraq and matched that to AQ expenditures and losses? Do you actually believe that you're now safe from another AQ attack? Bin Laden is on the loose and AQ grows in membership affiliation and financial backing on a daily basis.

It is hard to imagine how someone can argue that we went to war for economic intentions. War is one of the most expensive endeavors a country to participate in.
