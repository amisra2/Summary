War is profitable for the businesses that make tanks, guns, etc. Most of the expense rests on the poor, who actually do the fighting.","jyoshu","79176","No, the U.S. already had the tanks and guns they took to Iraq, before they even decided to go to war there. The monetary expense is shared by all, in the form of tax dollars--the fuel and and survival expenses for the soldiers cost more in expenses since the war started than the weapons which were already in our arsenals.","religious-war","11:10 PM","government-debates","16"
"11-26-2004","3781",2,"marc9000","None","I find it difficult to comprehend how you can claim there was no relationship between two countries that are thousands of miles away from you, in this day and age of communications. Or that Iraq had no relationship with WMD's, since history shows they DID. Or that you can clearly see AQ growing on a daily basis. With all you know, it seems you should be able to back up your claims with some DATES - when is AQ going to attack us next? - when is the stock market going to crash??","georged","79179","Relationship as in allies assisting each other. UN inspectors verified WMDs were destroyed and none have been located since our invasion/occupation. Each Iraqi nationalist we kill or imprison in our spread of democracy has to multiply by the factor of family supporting AQ or affiliated organizations. That's a daily progression and some good-sized numbers. Why should AQ bother wasting resources with another direct attack against us at this time? We're draining ourselves quite nicely with Iraq, homeland security and a diminishing tax base from domestic economic failure. It would seem more effective to let us continue our delusion of safety and become ever more complacent while burning even more money on domestic security. We'll probably spend another $20-billion we don't have on increased security for New Year's Eve celebrations alone. Everyone in the world but Americans understand AQ is waging an economic war against the US, not a conventional military engagement. Periodic $500k cost to AQ attacks, considering the untold trillions of dollars of economic damage they achieve, will eventually get the full attention of the voters and our government's inability to stop them. To me, the stock market never recovered from the dot.com fiasco. Some day traders do well with specific issues while brokerage agents and fund managers keep churning that same 500 point band up and down. Baby boomers will eventually give it final rites when they discover their equity investments have dissolved with the dollar and start cashing in as they attempt to maintain a retirement lifestyle remotely approaching the 'good old days' and avoid pet food as entres. What's your concern with dates? Do they present you with some symbolic meaning?","religious-war","11:22 PM","government-debates","17"

"11-26-2004","3781",2,"jyoshu","None","Agreed. It is hard to imagine how someone can argue that we went to war for economic intentions. War is one of the most expensive endeavors a country to participate in. The opponents of the Iraq war are contradicting themselves on this: on one hand they condemn the war over its monetary expense, and on the other hand they claim we went to war for economic reasons. Ridiculous.","georged","79182","Have we so quickly forgotten how the current administration had Americans believing that once the non-existent WMDs were destroyed and the tyrannical SH was removed that Iraq would welcome democracy with open arms and the oil would flow for reconstruction and building a prosperous, democratic Iraq? The $18.6-billion funded by congress for Iraq reconstruction, little spent and much diverted for 'security', probably wouldn't repair Fallujah, much less the rest of the country we continue to destroy in our 'low casualty' war. Iraq's repaired oil pipelines are normally running at 60-70% capacity, 100% capacity being equal to what Iraq was producing prior to the invasion, due to continual 'insurgent' attacks. Every war is about power and money. Bush Jr is experiencing the very problems that Bush Sr expressed in declining a full invasion and removal of SH after the Gulf War.","religious-war","11:39 PM","government-debates","19"

I find it highly unlikely that conventional security measures would ever stop another well-financed, well-planned effort to penetrate any of our non-military defenses. And as this isn't a conventional war, as proven by 9/11, logic would dictate another soft civilian target. While writing those ever-growing checks for extra security, keep in mind that you or anyone else can easily charter a good-sized jet aircraft, or three, through general aviation by merely dragging out a credit card. All you need is money, ID and a destination. And they won't make you take off your shoes, belt and coat before boarding. But that's old hat. I'd think we're in for a different type of surprise this next time around. That America feels safer while spending our national wealth on public shams is what's ridiculous.","religious-war","12:11 AM","government-debates","20"

The Iraqis took them out to the disposal sites and soil and waste samples confirmed that large amounts of chemcal weapons had been incinerated. They did find some, mostly what Blix refered to as ""forgotten leftovers"" which they put under guard at various chemical dumps, to later be capped with concrete. Unfortunatly, when we invaded, we didn't bother to guard them and they have since vanished. Such a shame, we have done what saddam was never willing to, which is provide terrorists with chemical and biological weapons. We were just so convinced that he had them, and had them hidden, that we didn't believe our own inspectors. Do you really believe you are safer now that we are frisking old women and congressmen at airports? George us right, we are basically just throwing money at the problem without doing any kind of cost/benifit analysis. We are spending tens of billions per year securing our aviation sector, and that is not counting the massive grants we are giving to the big airlines to make up their losses due to lower ticket sales. When they attack nex and use ships, we can certianly expect to spend another several billion to sucure our harbors, several billion more to secure our civilian buildings. All this time, our sothern border leaks like a seive in order to keep a steady supply of cheap labor available.","religious-war","08:23 AM","government-debates","21"

So, yes, obviously we've been safer. If (God-forbid) we do have another at some point, then time may show you were right. For now though, it seems you are wrong. And let's face it, the only reason we're having to frisk everybody at airports such as old women is because of the bellyaching from the far left over racial profiling.

In times of heavy travel and long security lines, I've gone through metal detectors with a pants pocket containing change and no alarm sounded. In less-crowded circumstances, a single coin in my pocket has set off the detector. When I'm fortunate enough to catch a private ride through friends or business acquaintances, there are no general aviation problems with removing my shoes and the crew never questions me even though they may never have seen me before. All they do is greet me with a big smile and welcome aboard Mr.. The profiling is as silly and useless as people being surprised to discover there are a large number of fair haired and skinned people of Mediterranean and S. American ancestry. To believe one is safe when the original circumstances that caused 9/11 still exist, in expanded form, is akin to burying one's head in the sand, regardless of how much money one spends. Our current cash drain on domestic security and increased conventional military spending is every bit as damaging as another physical attack, but it provides a warm, fuzzy feeling to the general populace that they're being 'protected' and avoids criticsm of the politicians for doing nothing while the original cause of our fear is still in place. Are we so complacent and self-assured by our own government as to actually believe 9/11 methodolgy would be duplicated in a future attaCK?","religious-war","11:12 AM","government-debates","23"

Teh question we should be asking is why? One theory that seems to be gainin popularity is that AQ membership has been increasing so rapidly that they are focused right now on internal organization and simply do not have the resources to organise a new attack while dealing with getting their new members lined up and all their new money counted and hidden (their memebrship has more than tripled and their assets have multiplied 4 fold). Absence of an attack does not mean that we are any safer, it merely means they haven't decided to attack us yet. If I hold loaded gun to your head but don't shoot you right away, that does not mean you are safe, merely that I have not pulled the trigger. We don't seem to have really foiled any attacks that we are aware of, though there is some conjecture that we may have. the reports to the contrary seem to be based on information that an attack may have been considered as opposed to actually disrupting plans that had operational details worked out. I am farily certain that, int he event we DID manage to foil an operational plot, that our government would be quick to hold it up to the Aemrican people as an example of how well they are being protected. Did you not catch the Scheuer interview where he said he considered the possibilty of AQ using some kind of nuclear wepon against america as nearly inevitable? This is the guy who was incharge of tracking BL for several years. The CIA has now reported that a dirty bomb is well within AQ's capabilities. You really think you are safer because we have mroe airport screeners? You should really take a look at the way AQ is structured and the way they operate. The structure was developed by our own intellignce people. They are a series of independant cells, each composed of a few members. Each cell operated independantly, but two or more cells can band together for major operations. Their strategy (as it was taught to them by members of our own CIA) is to hit soft targets, and as the enemy hardens previous targets, move on to new ones. Shoot and scoot is the name of the game. If we develop a profile, they will simply fashion their operatives to not fit the profile. It is worth rememebring that the majority of the worlds muslims are NOT from the middle east. As we have moved this from a war over former policy into the realm of a war of civilizations, we are driving non middle eastern muslims to Al Quedas ranks. All that developing a workable profile will do is aid the enemy in getting past it. We have helped them enough, they don't need any more, thank you. You are entirely correct here, George. To imagine we are safe when the enemy is stronger, we are weaker, and the conditions which led to the original attacks are not only still in exisatnce, but aggrevated, is just plain rediculous, as is the thought that they would use the same emthedology twice. Now, with several hundred million extra dollars to play with, tens of thousands of extra people, and permission to use nuclear weapons, as well as an arguable case to the international community now that we have embarked on a pat of foreign agression, AQ can take off the kiddy golves and get down to business. I don't think people realise (American, at least) that we CAN loose this war, and we are well on the way to doing it. We are spending ourselves to death. This is how we brought down the Soviet Union. We forced them to spend so much on defense that their economy could not handle it. Not only is AQ doing the same to us, they have done one further and shown every anti american group in the world that it CAN be done, you CAN hit America and make it hurt, and with a relatively low cost in manpower and money.","religious-war","11:55 AM","government-debates","24"

I often wonder if AQ isn't biding its time, we're certainly doing enough economic damage to ourselves to satisfy any enemy for the time being, until the dollar reaches a low point where some oil producer like Venezuela (not even a fan of US policy) begins to accept Euros or Swiss Francs as payment to protect its own portfolio. I notice Bush is again publicly courting Mexico and, with revised trade agreements removing some of the flak he gave them for not joining the 'coalition', Canada. The next round of nations accepted by the EU will further broaden the mix of their economic base and provide lower cost manufacturing labor.","religious-war","12:23 PM","government-debates","25"

I notice the WTO is beginning to retaliate to attempted US isolationism for votes tariffs with some of their own penalties, specifically on steel. I wasn't aware of Russia's strategy and must say I applaud their fiscal resourcefulness. As Russia and former USSR states continue developing oil production, with China, other Asian nations and parts of Europe being primary beneficiaries of that production, it will put enourmous pressure on operating margins of some OPEC producers dependent on Chinese imports, to the point where the US could feel pressured to use aggression to maintain supplies purchased with dollars. Won't that move eventually prompt Cheney to threaten Russia beyond election results bickering?

Are you sure you addressed this to the right guy? this is the guy who has advocated allowing half the world to starve to death rather than provide foreign aid! Far left? Are you on crack? As far as when we can expect the US economy to take a sharp downturn (as if it hasn't already), that is difficult to surmise becuase there is no real frame of reference. Our situation is fairly unique. We basically have a ton of savings, but no industrial capacity to speak of. We are showing a net loss of roughly a trillion dollars per year, and our currrency is dropping in value at a fairly alarming rate. We are carrying a massive debt load, both public and private, and don't really have the resources to service that debt. We are sitting on 77 trillion in unfunded federal obligations. There are certainly some economuc circumstances that can give some degree of guidance, but nothing in history really prepares anybody to make valid timeline based estimates in an econmy like this. Simly put, there has never been a single nation on earth that has posessed all the negative qualities that are present in the american economy all at one time.
