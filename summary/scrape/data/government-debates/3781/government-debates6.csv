"12-02-2004","3781",6,"marc9000","None","Let's get back to the company thing again (loooooove that company thing). Can you get numbers which show comparisons of how much the US company takes in, and spends, in different years? You say this is the first time in history the US has no money. That means we're spending more than we're taking in. How much did we spend in 2003, and how much did we take in? Are the numbers available for 1963? 1933? They wouldn't have to be adjusted for inflation. Would they clearly show how, in relation to income increases, spending increases have ballooned? Well, you said bring it on, here's a link to an economic viewpoint that doesn't seem to be filled with fear. It probably won't help or hurt the points I'm trying to make. I'll read your comments on it until one of two things runs out - my public high school education, or my interest. I'm sure the latter will be the first to go. http://www.townhall.com/columnists/j...20041129.shtml With its rising budget deficit and ballooning trade imbalance, the United States is running up a foreign debt of such record-breaking proportions that it threatens the financial stability of the global economy, according to a report released Wednesday by the International Monetary Fund. Prepared by a team of I.M.F. economists, the report sounded a loud alarm about the shaky fiscal foundation of the United States, questioning the wisdom of the Bush administration's tax cuts and warning that large budget deficits pose ""significant risks"" not just for the United States but for the rest of the world. The report warns that the United States' net financial obligations to the rest of the world could be equal to 40 percent of its total economy within a few years ""an unprecedented level of external debt for a large industrial country,"" according to the fund, that could play havoc with the value of the dollar and international exchange rates. The danger, according to the report, is that the United States' voracious appetite for borrowing could push up global interest rates and thus slow global investment and economic growth. ""Higher borrowing costs abroad would mean that the adverse effects of U.S. fiscal deficits would spill over into global investment and output,"" the report said. Though the International Monetary Fund has criticized the United States on its budget and trade deficits repeatedly in the last few years, this report was unusually lengthy and pointed. And the I.M.F. went to lengths to publicize the report and seemed intent on getting American attention. ""I think it's encouraging that these are issues that are now at play in the presidential campaign that's just now getting under way,"" said Charles Collyns, deputy director of the I.M.F.'s Western Hemisphere department. ""We're trying to contribute to persuade the climate of public opinion that this is an important issue that has to be dealt with, and political capital will need to be expended."" The I.M.F. has often been accused of being an adjunct of the United States, its largest shareholder. But in the report, fund economists warned that the long-term fiscal outlook was far grimmer, predicting that underfunding for Social Security and Medicare will lead to shortages as high as $47 trillion over the next 70 years or nearly 500 percent of the current gross domestic product in the coming decades.","lord tammerlain","80219","First here are a couple of links to websites that have the US government debt per year since 1940 upt to 2000 which after wards are just estimates (wrong ones by the way 2004 US government debt is now 7.8 trillion http://www.treas.gov/education/fact-...fed-debt.shtml The second one is the current account deficit from 1960 to present. http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/...curracctab.htm From looking at this data, you can determine that the US government deficit in 1963 was 6 billion dollars. The US government deficit for 2004 is likely to be 440 billion dollars. While I dont know the inflation adjustment for that time frame, I will compare it to cars. I believe a typical car cost about $2000 usd in 1960 a typical car in 2004 is going for $24000 about 12 times. Going by that number the US debt of 63 would be about equal to 70 billion 2004 dollars. The current account for the US from 1960 untill 1983 has generally been positive except during oil crunches. From 1983 to present there has only been one year with a positive current account number and that was 1991. This means that their is more money leaving the US in the form of debt then there is coming in. Generally this is something that has to be paid off at some point in time. If the current account deficit was created by purchasing wealth creating equipement like factories or machinery the problems would be mitigated by the growing economic activity. See South Korea during the 90's South Korea had a trade deficit but that deficit was used to build up South Korea's now impressive industrial capacity. Not to fund daily consumable purchases. South Korea is now one of the industrial powers, in the world. Hyundia now builds cars that are just as good as the japanese in initial qualtiy. The US in general has used its current account deficit to buy consumer goods from Japan and now China. A none productive use of debt, as it doesnt help pay back the debt like a house or a new factory would. http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/...imfwarnsus.htm The above snipit for the link indicates that the IMF believes that the US trade deficit and government deficit are likely to become problems. Now before you accuse this being some liberal socialist bull, the IMF and the Worldbank are probably the most hated institutions by anti globalists and by socialists in general.","religious-war","06:28 AM","government-debates","76"
"12-02-2004","3781",6,"None","None","None","daewoo","80250","Sorry, don't have time for a point by point here. I have meetings all mornign then have to be in Pennsylvania this afternoon. http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/crisis/tables.htm Has some interesting charts regarding US trade and budget deficits. Generally, info prior to 1960 is a little hard to come by on the net because there wasn't a problem, so it isn't studied much. As far as th aarticle by Kemp goes (I have to wonder whether taking economic advice from a football player is really a good idea), it contains several fallacies. The first is in his argument that interest rates are not tied to the deficit. He is right, they are not. He fronts the ascertation that somwhere along the lines policymakers and the public at large are making poor decisions because they believe they are. This is untrue. Everybody knows they are not. We are not making estimates and policy decisions based on that idiotic fallacy. Interest rates have always been primarily based on the demand for expansion capitol. this is how the fed manipulates the economy. During tiems of high demand for expansion capitol, interest rates rise, keeping growth in check. During ties of decline in demand for investment capitol, they fall, making borrowing more attractive, thus spurring the economy. The problem is that we are now raising interest rates, though the demand for expansion capitol is virtually non existant. Our current rate hike and the ones that we have already been warned are coming are the result of poor sales of our bonds. We can no longer talk foreign invesators into financing our debt becuase the dollar is dropping so quickly that to pick up a short term bond issues becaue the rate of inflation is higher than the interest rate. You buy a short term bond today, and you LOOSE money. The second fallacy presented is that the value of the dollar is tied only to avalable supply. This is untrue. When speculating in currency, the value of any particular currency (since they are no longer backed by gold or silver as a rule) is determined by what you believe the economic condition of the nation issuing the currency is. While supply of greenbacks is certainly an issue, nations generally avoid printing excess currency, so it is usually not really a problem. Lacking a true standard for the dollar (I.E gold), the only thing really backing the dollar is what is percieved to be the value of the US. The days are gone when you can lower inflation simply by printing less money. Less than half of the ""money"" we have floating around even actually exists. The majority of our ""money"" is just ones and zeros floating through a computer network somewhere. If everybody went today to withdraw every penny they have, both individuals and corportations, they would be soorely disapointed to find that there are not nearly enough greenbacks to cover all the ""money"" that is out there. You can certainly RAISE inflation by printing more money, and for all intents and purposes, we are cranking up the printing presses and have been for a while. The last major issuance of US debt was purchased primarily by the Us government, because nobody else was willing to buy it. This is why interest rates are, and will be, going up. We have NEVER had to do this before. Interest rates have never before been raised simply to make our bonds look more appealing. Our debt has always been finaced on the strenght of the dollar and the relative strenght of the American economy. Now, with the dollar falling and the economy falling in the toilet, foreign investors (and even American investors) are unwilling to buy our bonds. What kemp is doing is applying 30 yr old economic models to todays economy and they don't work. He even goes so far as to argue that the current deficit, which is one of the things that has primarily driven the dollar through the floor, is unproblematic and that if maintained, will be taken care of by economic growth. What economic growth? He is simply looking at growth in GDP as economic growth overall. Thsi si rediculous. Our GDP has increased primarily due to increased governemtn spending. Production is DOWN. If you look at true economic growth (production and expeditures), the US is experiencing negative growth. For years we used GDP as an indicator of growth (GDO is mostly just a measure of transactions). This doesn't work once you get into a situation where your GDP is primarily driven by the incursion of debt and government spending. We were talkign about Argentina and their problems earlier in the thread. Go back and look at their GDP for the years in question. It was GREAT. By the old ""High GDP=good economic growth"" formula, they were growing faster than any other nation on the planet. Look at where they are now. The old formula breaks down when your GDP is artificially manipulated (the result of governement spending and debt).","religious-war","11:20 AM","government-debates","77"

The old model of looking primarily at GDP in determining the growth or decline of a nations economy has fallen. It used to be that when nations failed economically despite fairly high GDP numbers, it was considered an abberation. The thing is, these ""abberations"" when viewed together all have common traits such as high personal and public debt, low industrial output, high government spending, a large trade deficit and a currency that falls despite the fact that GDP is up. It is the high governement spending and the high level of debt that floats the GDP numbers. This is how America is floating our GDP right now. If you take a look at Argentina from 1994-1998, growth was a steady 4%. Inflations was an agreeable 1.8%. Within 3 years, unemployment was at 25%, inflation was in the triple digits, prices were jumping 10% per month, and theri stock market was declining at a rate of nearly 75% per year. In 2001, there wa a period of debt refinancing, which they were forced to do at higher interest rates (gee, this sound familiar) in an attempt to keep enoguh cash flowing to keep their people fed and in line. Many economic experts thought that 2001 would be the end of their problems as we saw their GDP begin to struggle out of the pit it was in. This is because they were working the old economic models. Instead, in 2002, the economy finally really crashed. Hyperinflation took over as the Governemtn started buying their own debt since the world would not finanace them anymore at affordable rates. Finally they defaulted on their international debt alltogether. Unfortunatly if you take an honest look at todays economy in America, you will see that there are definatly some starteling parralels between the economy in Argentina in the late 90's and America today, such as debt rate (public and private), trade deficits, refinancing of debt at higher rates, etc...","religious-war","09:29 PM","government-debates","79"

Overall the comparisons are quite similar. The US has/is fought/fighting two major wars in the last 20 years ( cold war, war on terror). The US used to be a creditor nation, like Britain back then, Britain lost its manufacturing lead to the US and partially to Germany, the US lost it to East Asia in particular.","daewoo","80529","Excellent article! I particularly like the way they shoot down the four opposing arguments in 4 short paragraphs! It seems that a lot of the problem in both cases (domestic economic woes and international currency concerns) is linked to people trying to apply old world economic models to situations where they do not fit. Granted, we do not have proven economic models for a lot fo the new situations, but it seems that by applying what we do know, with just a dab of common sense (like, internationl banks are not going to bouy the dollar up forever as long as they are loosing money on the deal), the state of the nations finances should not be that hard to ascertain.

But that wasn't during the current Bush administration. I'm not convinced that our problems are caused by defence spending. Inflation adjustment probably depends on who is doing the adjusting. I agree that car prices are a good basic way to do it. I'd say you're right on with the $2000 average price for a 1960 car. But I'd bet there are a lot of things that haven't multiplied by 12 since 1960. Car tires and lumber immediately come to my mind. I'm just guessing they haven't gone up that much. What must be remembered is that products go up faster than inflation when there is government meddling involved. Auto pollution mandates, and safety mandates, (mainly airbags) have greatly increased the price of new cars only recently. With the many children who have been decapitated by airbags, and all the resulting legal action and new research and development for better airbags, the newest car prices have increased much more than other products. The year that many liberals were screaming that we couldn't afford to remove Saddam Hussien from Kuwait. This reminds me of a local news report last night. I-75 has a bridge crossing the Ohio river in Cincinnati. 40+ years old - running way over capacity for years - it will become dangerous if not replaced. There has been a lot of hand wringing over it for years. Very costly, I think it was earlier estimated it would take 10 years to do. After a few years of proposals on new configurations etc, the report last night stated that a 5 year, $18 million ""environmental impact study"" will now begin. With this kind of waste and stupidity, we have NO CHANCE of immitating the progress of South Korea, Argentina, or China. Am I blaming America first? No, I'm blaming LIBERALISM first. I agree with it.

Now, sign the credit card agreement and only BK will stop their collection efforts. In contemporary Islamic circles, that still holds true, the difference being that breaking your word can cause failure of your entire life. Debt must be affordable, produce a tangible increase in net worth to satisfy emotional and commerce fundamentals and always be honored.

Is it really so important that Americans fell superior, like we have the best country in the world, that it is better to ignore the problem, ensuring that your average American is caught completely unaware when it really hits the fan? To me, this is reminecent of 9/11. The American public was shocked and outraged at the attack. They were the only ones. While a large protion of the world certainly thought they were a bad thing, I don't think that anybody was really surprised to see America hit by a terrorist attack. Even our own government wasn't that surprised. FEMA has been issuing dire warnings and experts have been calling the possibility of attacks a ""certainty"" for a long time. A lot of folks thought we should just be relieved it wasn't a nuclear attack. It seems we are fated for the same kind of ""shocking surprise"" when it comes to our economy and it is a damn shame. The indicators are all there. With the situation the economy is currently in, problems are not a possibility, they are a certainty. It is just a matter of when and how bad.
