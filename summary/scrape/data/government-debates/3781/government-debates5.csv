"11-30-2004","3781",5,"marc9000","None","We made it work during WW2 didn't we?","daewoo","79702","No, we sure didn't. WWII brought us out of the depression. There was still plenty of money in the country, it was just heald in the hands of a relative few. Prior to WWII, we were even running a positive trade balance When we geared up for war production and increased the size of our military to fight the war, taxes went up and the government issued a bunch of bonds. Most of the bonds were purchased by the wealthy, and the increase in taxes was primarily for the wealthy (nobody else had any money to pay taxes anyway). Waht happeneed during WWII was basically a redistrobution of wealth through taxation and government job creation. What we are seeing now is a nation that is running out of money. Big difference. While there are still (obviously) a realtively few number of people controlling the lins share of the wealth in America, there is simply not as much wealth as there once was, because it is going overseas. Our money si going to the chinese, which they use to buy television sets and radios and diaper. It is going to the Japanese who use it to buy new cell phones and apartments and hondas. It is going to Eurpoe where they use it to buy anti bush protest signs. Perhaps worst of all, it is going to Iraq to rebuild buildings in falluja that we just spend over a billion dollars blowing up. For the majority of this nations history, our net worth grew. First it grew throught he exportation of natural resources, then it grew through the development of a first rate industrial infrastructure. Then it leveled off, now it is shrinking. Our first rate industiral infrastructure is GONE. We produce next to nothing here. Our easily exploitable natural resources are gone, and what is left we can't export becuase they are cheaper on the international market. So, every year, instead of the US gaining money, we are loosing it. It might help to think of the US as a really big company. The company isn't making money. the company is not even making enough to pay its expenses (not even close) so we are basically living off of our savings. Living off you rsavings has a down side. They will eventually run out. Our savigns are running out. As they run out, we borrow more and more money to try to stay afloat. The more money we borrow, the less the dollar is worth, effectively depleting our savings further (though the dollar figure stays the same, the dollars are worth less). Now the dollar is dropping quickly enough that we are having trouble getting anybody to finance our debt, so we are going to have to raise interest rates to keep our offering attractive. The higher interest rates will hurt the home market, driving down real estate values and putting a lot of people upside down in their homes. It will also hurt the automobile market, and just about anything else that people generally finance. Is any of this getting through to you?","religious-war","01:57 AM","government-debates","62"

But if I page around some, I can still find a little substance. On WW2, it's easy to do an analyzation of any of our past problems since we can now see the whole picture.

And there was much doom and gloom predicted then by people like you, who said it was going to be a train wreck, and there's nothing we can do. I like the ""think of the US as a really big company"" idea. So what you're saying is that in all our past problems, we had money, we weren't living on savings, so THIS is the biggest problem the US has ever faced? Maybe because before, we were really the only ""company"" in the world, and now we finally have other ""companies"" that are outperforming us? And you don't know what to do? So you wouldn't make a very good company president? But you seem to be very confident on what NOT to do. (invade Iraq). Wouldn't you say the very first priority would be to make money? You said we produce next to nothing here. A little silly, we produce a lot of food. We may not have the industrial sweat shops that we used to have. Maybe some of them were sued out of existance? Maybe some were closed down by the EPA? Maybe it's time to take a look at some of our ""employees"". Could it be that other companies, (the China company for example) don't have our do nothing government bureaucracies dragging them down. Maybe our EPA could pack up their chemistry sets and head to China and clean up their environment for them? That company wouldn't hire them, that's the problem. I wonder if Chinese school buses cost twice what they're worth to finance safety features that are never used? I wonder if the Chinese president has the line item veto? So the line item veto has been declared unconstitutional? I hadn't heard, but it's not surprising. I'd say the courts were pressured into that by the same congress that won't allow us to impose much needed term limits on them. The Democrats wouldn't, and the Republicans won't. It's probably going to take a recession or a depression to get these things done. Some h*ll raising by the general public could get it done. Too bad we're too busy squalking about the Iraq war, something we don't know as much about as we think. The general public isn't going to notice our financial situation if we're spending.....whatever it is, millions or billions on the rock and roll hall of fame. Am I getting through to you yet? Our company has some employees in Iraq right now. It has to do with oil, and terrorists. They're earning their paychecks. The interior of our country has a lot of do-nothing employees that need to be fired. A depression may do it. It won't be a train wreck. I suppose you're brimming with confidence at our competition around the world. I hear China is building six cities the size of New York City. The price of US steel has really gone up lately. (whoooops - I forgot, we don't produce anything) I guess you probably believe that the Chinese are all walking aroung with their pockets overflowing with Euros, and they're paying cash for everything. I wonder how much they're financing - who is really taking the risks. What easily exploitable US natural recources are gone? I can think of some recources that are shrinking - morals, values, work ethic, appreciation of freedom, patriotism, and other things. Oh yes, FAMILY VALUES!!! You made fun of me before I said it, do you have ESP?? It took decades for the US to get in this financial condition, and it's going to take time to get it out. Why do you furiously blame only the current administration? If we didn't invade Iraq, would everything suddenly be fixed? Or would it just prolong the bleeding before the train wreck?

We can see, right now, that even running at current maximum industrial capacity, we can't even get close to leveling out our trade imbalance. There is a major difference between the doom and gloom predicted in the past and the unpleasantness facing us today. The gloom and doom in the past was primarily hypethetical. Todays unpleasantness is not. It is ehre, right now, staring us in the face. Do you know where the dollar is trading today? Take a look at the trend in the dollar for the last few years as opposed to other major currencies. Yep, this is pretty much the biggest problem we have ever faced. In the past we have faced civil discord, wars, depressions, you name it. We came thoguh all those things primarily because we could afford them. we could afford to fight WWI and WWII. We could afford to beat the Sovients int eh cold wa. We could afford to put up social programs to pacify the hyper liberals. Without money, you cannot afford to fight wars, you cannot afford social programs, you cannot afford to feed your people. This is the direction we are headed in. Look at the numbers (you obviously haven't). Any 10th grader with a calculater should be able to see which way this thing is going. Without money, a country is pretty much sunk. I know that when you are facing a huge deficit, a huge trade imablance, and a currency dropping like a rock, you shouldn't be spedning hundreds of billions of dollars invading, destroying, and rebuilding foreign countries. We do produce a lot of food, for all the good it does us. The problem is that our food is expensive. It is cheap at the counter because the government subsidizes it, but over all, the cost of US agriculture is high. Theoretically we could crank out more food, but htat would only hasten our demise as the government scrables to susidize ag products for export, effectively ensuring that we provide cheap grain to the rest of the world. The EPA and government regulations had very little with the demise of American business. What has killed American business is mostly the result of American labor prices, thoguh there ae other factors as well (we would need a whole new thread for that). This happened back in '98. How can you possibly be making political commentary, especially regarding the economy, when you missed something this major?? If you don't mind me asking, how old are you? If you are young, I suppose that expecting you to remember something of a political nature that happened 6 years ago may be asking a little much. If you are not young, and you profess to have some kind of insight into economics and federal spending, this is nigh inexcusable. The line item veto was overturned becasue it was ruled unconstitutional. You will likely need a constitutional amendment for the other changes you suggest here, too, assunming that in talking term limits for judges you are talking supreme court as well. If what e need is a recession or a depression, we are in luck, because an economic crash is pretty much looming on the horizon. Ok, so we frie tehse employees, and then what? As far as building a rock and roll hall of fame, that doens't make a bit of difference as far as national economic condition, and may even help. The enemy is NOt domestic spending. Domestic spending provides jobs for americans and helps the economy along. The problem is with foreign spending, trade imbalances, and deficit spending. If you can seriously look at the figures and come to another conclusion, I would like you to please explain how. Yes. The chinese are paying cash for everything. They just took some pretty serious measures to slow theri economic growth, as their first quarter growth was 9.7% and they were shooting for 8% this year. Even taking the measures that tey have, they are not going to make 8%, it will be closer to 8.3%. China is responsible for 15% of worldwide economic expansion last year. If only we had their problems. They are financing about 2-3 percent internationally, but have more than enough cash reserves to pay what htey have financed. In fact, they are grabbing up US currency by the fistfull right now in an attempt to bring it up in value a little. Now that christmas imports are in, and they have been paid in low value dollars, they are trying to drive the dollar up a bit so they can convert it to a high value currency slowly. The upside to this is that the dollar will rise, or at least decline a little mroe slowly, over the next few months. The down side to this is that it will undoubtedly reach a new low as they convert it to euros or yen. Teh thing you might want to take note of, in case all that was over your head, is that hte chinese have enough extra cash laying around to make major manipulations in the value of the dollar. Unfortunatly, US steel is up because scrap prices are up. Scrap prices are up because of international demand (mostly the chinese and the russians). As long as scrap stays up, so will US steel. International demand for US steel just fell off a cliff the last week or two as several south American reprocessing plants came back online simultaneously. Copper, gold, silver, lumber, coal, Iron. We haven't found a new surface deposit, or near surface deposit of any size of any of these for a lot of years. New, in order to get any of these at profitably exploitable quatities requires deep penetration mining. It is not prolonging the bleeding before the train wreck, it is hasteneing the eventual wreck. Lets say you loose your job tommorow and can't find a new one. You have $10,000 in savings, would you really send $2000 to starving orphansd in Africa? That is essentially what we are doing with the war and subsequent rebuilding in Iraq. We are hastening the depletion of our economic resources. No, they are not having the same problem. They are running a positive trade balance. All their spending is being done in house, which means that it is contributing to the flow of money in their economy. Our spending is not being done in house. Back to the company example....What they are doing is effectively transferring money between departments in the same company (raising their GDP in the process). What we are doing is loosing money to the company down the road. BIG DIFFERENCE. The problem is that there is really nothign we CAN do. The problem has been going on too long. the only question now is how bad it will become and how long it will have to stay bad before it improves. Most of the projections and statistics I have seen regarding US production of real value goods are pretty distressing. The problem is that if you look at where US production is as opposed to where it should be, and factor in expansion costs, ther eis simply not enough money left in the country to bring our industrial capablitly up to where it needs to be. From a realistic standpoint,the guy who we need in office is the one who will never get elected. we need aguy who is willing to cut foreign aid. Es simply cannot afford it. We need a guy who is ready and willing to cut social programs like the prescription drug benifits. We cannot afford them. We need a guy who will cut back on governement services and benifits. We cannot afford them. We need a guy who will make a drastic change to foreign policy, not only to get our enemies off our back (beacause we can't afford to fight them) but because we can no longer afford the price in aid and military equipment that it takes to keep evil regimes afloat and kkep nations that cannot live without routinely bombing their neiborgs afloat (sorry, israel). We also need a guy who will slash and burn when it comes to the military budget. I agree that we need a strong defense, but our military is not currently geared towards defense. We are operating an offensive military. We need to let the rest of the world deal with their problems for a few years while we put our own house back in order. Pare the military down to the point that we still have strong defense for our borders and oru nation, but not such an excessive force that we are tempted to run all over the world playing policeman. THEN, after we have cut foreign spending (which is the real enemy) and domestic social spending, we need a serous round of tax cuts and growth incentive packages. Not for individuals (at least not right awy) but for businesses to encourage industrial expansion. We need to quite telling the ""service economy is a good thing"" lie and tell the truth ""every service economy in history has failed miserably"". We need to once again become the industrial giant that we once were. From a practical standpoint, that still would not provide enough money to build our industrial infrastructure to the point where it should be. As I said, there is simply not enough money left in the country to do that. It would, however, certainly help soften the XXXX. The problem is that a canidate that ran on such a platform would never win. The liberals wouldn never vote for him because he would slash their precious social programs and international aid. The conservatives would not vote for him because he would slash military spending. Both groups are wrong. The libs are wrong because without cutting those programs now so we can encourage industrial growth, they are ensuring that there will be more poor people who need such programs in the future, but there will be no money to pay for them. the conservatves are wrong because without an industrial infrastructure to support your military, you HAVE no defense. It was ONLY the fact that America had an excellent industrial infrastructure that allowed us to gear up production to meet demand for war materials during WWI and WWII. Evne now, the war in Iraq had drained our reserves (military equipment and armament) to a dangerously low level, and we do not have enough industry left to replace them at the needed rate. An attack on the continental United states right now could very possibly suceed because it will take 2 or more years to produce enough bombs and bullets and tanks and hummers to replace those destroyed or damaged beyond reasonable use in Iraq. How could anybody who claims to be pro defense allow this to be?","religious-war","11:38 PM","government-debates","66"
"12-01-2004","3781",5,"None","None","None","lord tammerlain","79914","Overall it has taken little more then two decades for the US to go from the worlds biggest creditor nation, to being the worlds biggest debtor nation. When I first heard that during the Reagan Admin that the US now owed more to foreign countries then the basket case of Brazil I was shocked. Since then what has been the ongoing trend in the US, lower personal savings, higher trade deficiets, higher governmental deficiets and a general loss in manufaturing. A recent article that I read indicated that tradeable goods make up 25% of the US economy, so roughly 2.5 Trillion dollars. Of this 2.5 trillion dollars 500-600 billion of it is accounting for the trade deficiet. A simple reduction in EPA regulations, allowing for more polution of your rivers and lakes ( Love Canal, Lake Erie) is not going to correct it. As for the Chinese, they have their own problems but because of a strong government who cares nothing about foreign companies and barely about it own individual people will be able to work through them. In 6 years or so the Asian economies will be able to live without the US. Domestic demand their will be more then enough to make up for the US. The US no longer has the influence that it had even 10 years ago. Europe, barely cares about the US other then for a trading partner, new US allies are finding that special trade agreement and military agreements are not worth the hassle. As seen by Poland and its complaint about funding for its troops in Iraq. As for Canada, our problems are domestic. We are now paying for our excess of the 80' and 90's by paying down our government debts. Made easier by the lower US dollar by the way. This is slowing down our economy. Since we started this earlier in the economic cylce then the US the after effects for Canada will be less harsh. Also that we are basically a resource based economy a surging China and India, will help our economy greatly. China is on the verge of buying one of Canadas largest oil companies for about $18 billion (Husky Oil). South/Central America is pulling away from the US politically and economically, Asia is pulling away towards China economically, Europe excluding the UK is also gravitating towards Russian and China. China especially economically, polilitcally and militarilly. The EU is very likely to end the export ban on military equipment to China in the next couple of years. France is very keen on this. You have the muslim world which by all accounts hates the US even more then they did just 5 years ago. Iran is making special deals with China, China is making economic deals with the Central asian republics in order to gain access to the expected large quantities of oil and gas there. What is the US response. To place military bases in those countries or right on the boarder when possible. Spending billions of dollars on the military when it would be cheaper just to buy the oil on the open market. Overall the US government and most of its major companies have been very short sighted, looking at 1 or 2 years down the road or even the next quarter and forgetting about 5 years or 10 years down the road. Well five years down the road, I expect the US to be in worse shape economically for the average american then during the Carter admin, much worse.","religious-war","02:52 AM","government-debates","67"

Even taking the measures that tey have, they are not going to make 8%, it will be closer to 8.3%. China is responsible for 15% of worldwide economic expansion last year. If only we had their problems. They are financing about 2-3 percent internationally, but have more than enough cash reserves to pay what htey have financed. In fact, they are grabbing up US currency by the fistfull right now in an attempt to bring it up in value a little. Now that christmas imports are in, and they have been paid in low value dollars, they are trying to drive the dollar up a bit so they can convert it to a high value currency slowly. The upside to this is that the dollar will rise, or at least decline a little mroe slowly, over the next few months. The down side to this is that it will undoubtedly reach a new low as they convert it to euros or yen. Teh thing you might want to take note of, in case all that was over your head, is that hte chinese have enough extra cash laying around to make major manipulations in the value of the dollar. Unfortunatly, US steel is up because scrap prices are up. Scrap prices are up because of international demand (mostly the chinese and the russians). As long as scrap stays up, so will US steel. International demand for US steel just fell off a cliff the last week or two as several south American reprocessing plants came back online simultaneously. Copper, gold, silver, lumber, coal, Iron. We haven't found a new surface deposit, or near surface deposit of any size of any of these for a lot of years. New, in order to get any of these at profitably exploitable quatities requires deep penetration mining. It is not prolonging the bleeding before the train wreck, it is hasteneing the eventual wreck. Lets say you loose your job tommorow and can't find a new one. You have $10,000 in savings, would you really send $2000 to starving orphansd in Africa? That is essentially what we are doing with the war and subsequent rebuilding in Iraq. We are hastening the depletion of our economic resources. No, they are not having the same problem. They are running a positive trade balance. All their spending is being done in house, which means that it is contributing to the flow of money in their economy. Our spending is not being done in house. Back to the company example....What they are doing is effectively transferring money between departments in the same company (raising their GDP in the process). What we are doing is loosing money to the company down the road. BIG DIFFERENCE. We need a guy who will make a drastic change to foreign policy, not only to get our enemies off our back (beacause we can't afford to fight them) but because we can no longer afford the price in aid and military equipment that it takes to keep evil regimes afloat and kkep nations that cannot live without routinely bombing their neiborgs afloat (sorry, israel). We also need a guy who will slash and burn when it comes to the military budget. I agree that we need a strong defense, but our military is not currently geared towards defense. We are operating an offensive military. We need to let the rest of the world deal with their problems for a few years while we put our own house back in order. Pare the military down to the point that we still have strong defense for our borders and oru nation, but not such an excessive force that we are tempted to run all over the world playing policeman. THEN, after we have cut foreign spending (which is the real enemy) and domestic social spending, we need a serous round of tax cuts and growth incentive packages. Not for individuals (at least not right awy) but for businesses to encourage industrial expansion. We need to quite telling the ""service economy is a good thing"" lie and tell the truth ""every service economy in history has failed miserably"". We need to once again become the industrial giant that we once were. From a practical standpoint, that still would not provide enough money to build our industrial infrastructure to the point where it should be. As I said, there is simply not enough money left in the country to do that. It would, however, certainly help soften the XXXX. The problem is that a canidate that ran on such a platform would never win. The liberals wouldn never vote for him because he would slash their precious social programs and international aid. The conservatives would not vote for him because he would slash military spending. Both groups are wrong. The libs are wrong because without cutting those programs now so we can encourage industrial growth, they are ensuring that there will be more poor people who need such programs in the future, but there will be no money to pay for them. the conservatves are wrong because without an industrial infrastructure to support your military, you HAVE no defense. It was ONLY the fact that America had an excellent industrial infrastructure that allowed us to gear up production to meet demand for war materials during WWI and WWII. Evne now, the war in Iraq had drained our reserves (military equipment and armament) to a dangerously low level, and we do not have enough industry left to replace them at the needed rate. An attack on the continental United states right now could very possibly suceed because it will take 2 or more years to produce enough bombs and bullets and tanks and hummers to replace those destroyed or damaged beyond reasonable use in Iraq. How could anybody who claims to be pro defense allow this to be?","marc9000","79924","We can see NOW that it was hypethetical.

As a child I heard plenty of talk about planning and building fallout shelters. Let's get back to the company thing again (loooooove that company thing). Can you get numbers which show comparisons of how much the US company takes in, and spends, in different years? You say this is the first time in history the US has no money. That means we're spending more than we're taking in. How much did we spend in 2003, and how much did we take in? Are the numbers available for 1963? 1933? They wouldn't have to be adjusted for inflation. Would they clearly show how, in relation to income increases, spending increases have ballooned? But you seem to think that just about the only way we spend money is on the military. What is the percentage of military spending compared to all domestic spending? More importantly, what is the percentage of military spending compared to the domino effect domestic government spending has on wasted private spending? Numbers RUN OUT long before all questions are answered. We don't dig for lumber. I don't think coal is much deeper than it ever was either. Government regulation goes deep. The US company pays the bill. But it stays in the US so it's okay, right? Let's pretend the US food company has a company store for it's employees. 33% of the US employees screw off all day and produce nothing. But they get a paycheck. They go to the company store and buy as much food as the other 67%. The 67% worked hard for the food for 100% of the people. They only got 67% of what they earned, so they're a little hungry. Suppose next month, 67% screwed off, and this time 33% of the workers did all the work. They'd be really hungry. But the money all stayed in the company didn't it? The more people that screwed off, the worse things got, even though the money all stayed in house. Hey I thought I was George Bush, that's my line. Maybe you felt you shook them like rag dolls - maybe they got tired of going around in circles. Maybe we are getting close to circles now, but there's a little more ground to cover. You've got at least one stumbling block before you get the rag doll feeling with me. You asked me how old I was, and I answered right away, along with the fact that I was not college educated. I said I wondered how old you were, and have heard nothing yet. I also wonder what university you attended. Georged commented about the bias of radio, TV, and print media. That they are biased to target audiences. He claimed he judges only the actions of politicians. I asked what his information source was, wondering if I could point out to him who their ""target audience"" might be. The silence is deafening. It's not the constitution that's the problem. It's today's corrupt interpretation of it that needs changed. Maybe your train wreck will make it happen. I live near the 54th(?) largest city in the US. About 15 full pages of jobs in every Sunday paper. Thanks for asking! Probably HALF of all do nothing government jobs, most of which were created only recently by bureaucracies whose main objective is to sustain themselves, and grow at taxpayers expense. The EPA and the IRS would be a good start, though there are plenty more. It wouldn't take long to go above and beyond the temporary extra expense of Iraq. With tort reform, we could lose a lot of lawyers, and insurance companies, and they could then go to work producing food. (making actual money for the company)There are private companies that are spawned by the EPA. They're private, so it skews your numbers since they produce nothing. They could get real jobs too. (for an example of that, see ""the cost of environmentalism"" in the environmental forum.) From what I've seen and heard from others, all countries with US tourists do. Their specialty is allowing tourists to see ONLY what they want them to see of their country. The EPA will monitor each shovelful. They will make commands, and other private companies will spring into action. As each domino falls, the US company pays. Osama wasn't a threat either. Where is he going to get planes to fly into our buildings? Where will he get people to ride on them? Are you going to tell me you weren't surprised when that happened? You think there's absolutely no chance that Saddam didn't have a surprise for us? It's tough for oppressed people to revolt. (Hungary, 1956) Maybe they'll find a way to sell it all to the Chinese. They don't have to sell us s**t if we don't have a persuasave presence there. The mere existance of our military just might encourage everybody to like Canadians. If our military didn't exist, and Canada had something somebody wanted, things could be different. They won't go away no matter what we do. I agree, but I can't think of any other country's populace that is renowned for their intelligence either. Well, you said bring it on, here's a link to an economic viewpoint that doesn't seem to be filled with fear. It probably won't help or hurt the points I'm trying to make. I'll read your comments on it until one of two things runs out - my public high school education, or my interest.
