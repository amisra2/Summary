True, he is enough of a realist to know that bad foreign policy for years has gotten us into the mess we are in today, but that shoudl hardly be news to anybody. Increased domestic spending? Increased taxes? Redistrobution of wealth? Are you nuts? george may be one of the most fiscally conservative people I have ever had the privelage of debating. He just moved states on the basis of controlled spending at the state and local level. Yes, like the president, who 10 years ago would have been considered a southern democrat. It is amazing to me how many ""conservatives"" are running around witht he false impression that Bush is a conservative and they somehow won something in the last election. I've got bad news for you, Clinton was more conservative than bush. Uncontrolled spending, huge deficits, and record increases in the size of governement are certianly a funny way to practice the supposed core values of the conservative party, which are fiscal responsibility and small government. If GW is what conservatives are now, what do you call folks like me and george, who advocate individual liberty, limited government, constitutional restraint fiscal responsibility and the minimal number of social programs required to keep starving, unwashed mobs from climing the wall in front of the house? I certainly don't think that ""far left"" fits the bill. Lets do a little test here. Classify the following people as either conservative or liberal: Pat Buchanan John Kerry George Bush Hint...there is only one conservative listed, the other 2 are hard core liberals","marc9000","79371","Am I on crack? Am I nuts? And then you tell me Clinton was more conservative than Bush? What we have here seems to be an attempt to re-define conservatism. You seem to think that it's all about spending - whoever spends the least is the conservative. In dictionary definations of the two words, (conservative, liberal) the word spending does not appear. Does that surprise you? Conservativism is about TRADITION. To preserve what is established. (And that does not include the spending programs of Bill Clinton, or FDR, by the way.) It includes Christianity, and traditional freedoms that are often questioned by safety and environmental ""experts"". But conservatism has long been for a strong national defence. Liberals are often defined by their attempts to CUT defence spending. Liberalism is about NOT being bound by tradition, and not having moral restraint. Welcoming abrupt change when believed to be for the common good. There are other honeyed phrases to describe liberalism. But the bottom line is, it simply doesn't work. It fails everywhere it's tried. What you're doing is lumping all spending together, foriegn and domestic, in your critisizm of Bush. If Kerry would have won the election, and immediately discontinued our action in Iraq, at the savings of...what $58 billion, then spent.....$40 billion more at home on additonal environmental programs, and government health care, I suppose you'd consider him more conservative than Bush. If you advocate individual liberty, limited government, and minimal social programs, how can you say Clinton was more conservative than Bush? Do you know anything about Clinton's administration? I'm sure in your little test, you claim that Buchanan is the most conservative, and thats right. He's run for president before - he can't even come close. So if true conservatism can't win, you favor todays Democrat over Bush, in your pursuit of individual liberty, and minimal number of social programs?

Or foreign policy continuing to fully support Israel's purge of Palestine and expansionist policy that invites another 9/11? Or continued expansion of conventional military power using crushing public debt when faced with an unconventional enemy constructed by our foreign policy? And the largest expansion of US federal government in our history using public debt during a time of reduced tax revenues, who's fault is that? Exploding state and municipal debt as the federal government reduces tax revenue sharing to polish federal numbers but pushes federal programs down the line complete with federal compliance measures and no funding? Gasoline prices that have doubled primarily due to our attempt to instill democracy in Iraq?

If you check with other countries, liberals are the exact opposite of what they are here. The core values of the conservative party (that would be the republicans) have ALWAYS included fiscal responsibility, small government, and constitutionally limited government (personal liberty). Spending programs of Bill Clinton? Are you living in some fantasy world or what! Bush has spent FAR more than clinton. Bush signed into law, and fully supported, the LARGEST and MOST EXPENSIVE social program in history! Yes, and Bush, who tried to suspend habeas corpus, in fact arguing in the supreme court that the governemtn had the right to hold anybody, US citizen or not, without charges, trial, or access to the courts, SECRETLY if the administration had reason to believe they were terrorists, or somhow involved int terrorism. That certianly isn't an abrupt change which he believed was for the common good! In exactly what situation do you feel Bush has shown moral restraint?? I know a LOT about clintons presidence. I know he spent FAR LESS on social programs than bush has. Of course, he was not stuck in a situation where he had to buy votes from seniors in order to win because he had embarked on an alleged humanitarian war. Bush promised another 3 trillion in additional social spending during his campaign for second term. I hope to god he reneges on those promises. We just don't have the money. Yes, I did, and I added up the projected costs of his programs (2 trillion) and Bushs (just over 3 trillion). Do I favor todays democrats over bush? No, bush IS ONE OF todays democrats. Again,m core values of teh republican party: Individual liberty.......Passed the aptriot act, tried to suspend habeas corpus. Nope, bush fails this one Fiscal Responsibility......Huge deficit...Huge social programs....Country so far in debt and incurrng debt so rapidly that the dollar is sinking like a rock. Bush fails this one as well Smaller government.....This must be a joke. Bush has increased the size of government mroe than any president in recent history Defense.....the majority of our combat troops are off fighting a war, and blowing up all our stockpiled bombs and ammo, which are supposed ot be used in defense of this country, in a war that has nothing to do with defending this country. Bush fails here as well. Maybe you could point out some of bushs conservative qualities, beyond the lip service he gives the evangelicals. He is sure looking like a liberal from where I am sitting. Yes, and the conswervatives really, really want the liberals to stop talking about it, BECAUSE IT TURNED OUT TO BE TRUE. You are 100% correct, Bush and company, who run and hide like cowardly dogs anytime somebody puts forth the concept of accountability, would certainly like for the entire world to forget that htere WERE NO WMDs. The UN inspectors confirmed it. OUR OWN inspectors confirmed it. The 150,000+ troops we have in coutry haven't found any. It is safe to say that THERE ARE NONE. Certainly those who support bush would like for us to foget that trillion dollar ""oops"". Only an IDIOT would put something like that out of their mind. If she was demoralised, it is because whe was backing a rediculous position that couldn't eb backed up with fact. I suppsoe that the truth is sometimes demoralizing. Personally I will take an ugly truth over a beautiful lie any day. That is the conservative in me (conservatives have long considered themselves realists, and considered liberals idealists, and it si not without merit). Bush has done more to help AQ than any liberal in the coutry. By pursuing a war of agression aginst a middle eastern coutry with no provable ties to Al Queda and in absence of an immediate threat, he hgas driven AQ's membership and resouces through the roof. They have over 3x as many members now, and 4x the money they did prior to the war in Iraq. Those were inspectors that WE PICKED and WE SUPERVISED and WE PROVIDED WITH INTEL. There is a damn good reason that we put faith in those inspectors. They spent 6 YEARS inspecting Iraq, using intellignece that WE PROVIDED. By the end they were literally inspecting 4'x4' GRADEN SHEDS because they had run out of places to look and the US was just certina that, despite the fcat they had visited EVERY suspected site, there were still hundreds of tons of WMD's laying around. As far as flying the flag at half mast, that is because Arafat was a sitting head of state, Reagan was not. US embasies in the ME and Africa flew THEIR flags at half mast when Arafat died, but not when Reagan did. This is a matter of diplomacy. I thought nitpicking was kind of a liberal trait...... So, what are you saying here? That the current administration was not responsible for informing the American public that they had absolute proof of hundreds of tons of WMD's, and that democracy would be met with open arms, or that we are not continuing to destroy Iraq? We did, after all, just LEVEL FALLUJAH. Sorry, I can't do any more. I finally understand your definition of a Copnservative. sOnbody who believes whatever teh conservative mouthpiece of the moment says, no matter how rediculous. I would have to add that this apparently includes believing things that are directly contradicted by commonly available facts, and often things that are directly contradicted by things previously stated by that same individual. If that is what your modern conservative is, I think I will pass and stick with fiscal restraint, small government, individual liberties, etc.... There is too much self deception doing it your way. Too much work.","religious-war","09:54 PM","government-debates","49"

By your defintion, conservatives just wanting to keep things the same, would imply that we are anti-technology, and we should be pushing to outlaw automobiles and go back to the horse and buggy days. Liberals, in a strictly literal sense of the word, are those who support liberty and personal freedom. Certainly NOT the definition of the liberal party in the US. Bull. the biggest chunk of social program spanding was on the prescription drug benefit program, which was ALL GW. It was pathetic vote buying. As far as privitization of social security, I can see both sides of that. While the governemtn is certainly not doing a very good job with it, it is a poorly concieved concept ot begin with. I can understand the reluctance of some to take the leap as far as privitization goes. Since most experts agree that our stock market is overvalued, governemet imposed long term investment right now, while providing a short term boost to the market, there is a very definate risk of people loosing big, then where does that leave you? it leaves you with a bunch of starving retired people who want a governemtn handout to make up for their idiocy. If the proposed social security reform included mroe freedom to decide where your money was invested, I would support it more. It also needs to include some kind of financing scheme for those currently getting social security. The transition to a privatized social securty will leave a HUGE shortage in the current system. Before we move to a privitized system, we nee dot figure out how to fund the oblicgation to the folks RIGHT NOW and in the near future for whom it is too late to take advantage of the new program structure. This is the problem I have seen with current republican plans to privitize social security. They focus ont eh benfits for those who will enter the system in the future, but I have yet to see a plan that addresses the issue of how we fund the fully public program until the privitization can take place and catch up. This is an example of the fiscal irresponsibility I have been talking about. Traditional conservatives DO NOT do things like try to pass modifications to programs without considering multi trillion dollar funding problems. These guyw ho are claiming to be conservatives now are doing what liberals traditionally do. They come up with a new idea and push for its adoption without ever bothering to fully consider how it will be paid for. It is only the new breed of conservatives, those like yourself, who don't bother to question such things, that are turning the conservative party into a prty of pedal stomping hamsters. NO, IT WASN'T JUST FOREIGNERS. John Ashcroft, acting under orders of the Bush administration, argued that AMERICAN CITIZENS could be held WITHOUT CHARGES, WIHTOUT BAIL, AND WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE COURTS, SECRETLY on US military bases. These were not FOREIGNERs. These were AMERICANS, and all it took to classify somebody as a possible terrorist was a SINGLE person in the DOJ writing a MEMO. THAT, my firend, is NOT the governemnt job. The governments primary job is to protect its people and our freedom. The governemnt JOB, is to ensure that things like that DO NOT HAPPEN to american citizens. In the past, we have risked WAR, even NUCLEAR war to ensure that things like that DO NOT happen to US citizens abroad, and here our OWN PRESIDENT is trying to do it to us right here at home. And you don't see a problem with this? I am not seeign here anything to suggest that my original ascertaion (that you ar obviously high on crack) is wrong. What in the name of god does this have to do with ""moral restraint"". I would like to see what kind of controtions you have to do in order to somehow tie EPA regulations to ""moral restraint"". This has nothing to do with liberty destroyed. this has to do with how much of our tax dollars are being redistributed to the lower class in poorly run, high margin federal social programs. This is something else conservatives have traditionally been against, government mandated re-distrobution of wealth. Bush, not being a conservative, has no problem with the idea. He has taken trillions from the taxpayers and handed it out to the lower classes in the form of feel good educational programs and prescription drug benefits. No, that is not a cop out. That is an observation of the guys political ideals. you are 100% correct. I voted, but not for a liberal like Bush or Kerry. I voted for the libertarian canidate, since he was a conservative, instead of a closet liberal like the republicans were running. Tort reform, good idea. Line item veto, also a good idea, and an idea that was advanced by the CONSERVATIVES. The idea behind the line itewm veto was that the president did not have to pass or fail a spending bill as a whole, he could remove parts of it in order to cut spending. It gave the executive branch (president) an extra check on congress. Since you are displaying some ignorance here in apparently somehow attaching the line itme veto to the liberals (and I know why, and we will touch on it in a minute), lets step into the wayback machine and step back to the days of reacga, when the idea of the line item veto really became an issue. The line item veto was orignally pushed as a way for the president to cut pork from spending bills. This was largely becasue back in the day when reagan was president, they needed support of the democrats in congress, who kept attaching pork to everything that came along. The bills wouldn't pass congress without all the pork attached. The idea was for the prsident to be able to edit out the pork, thus negating some of the deal making and soul selling that had to go on in order to get a bill through congress. Most presidents in the history of the United States have approved of the line item veto. Thhey could net get it passed under Reagan, becasue republicans could not get enough control over the congress to do so and the democrats certainly didn't want their pork cut out of every bill that came along. They couldn't get it passed under Bush 1 either. Finally, it passed during the clinton administration. At this point, the Republicans, who for the last 12 years had been pushing for the line item veto, decided that since a democrat was in power, this was a BAD idea, since it was ""their"" pork that would be cut instead of democrats pork. Froma realist standpoint, it probably never would have passed except that there were so many republicans running around who for so many years had heard what a great thing the line item veto was, that they failed to relaise that they were not supposed to support it (we are talking at the street level here). The whole mess is a mute point now anyway, since the courts have declared the line item veto unconstitutional. Originally, and still today, traditional conservatives largely support the theory, even if we can't practice it, because conservatives, being for fiscal responsibility, have always opposed pork barrel spending, at least in theory. No, not unless in order to be a conservative requires that you completely depart from reality. If I look in a box, and the box is empty, I will always say ""the box is empty"" even if the president himself tries to convince me that it is full of $100 bills, I know an empty box when I see one. you seem to be confused in what conservatism is. It is a system of ideals, not just a matter of who you side with. Wrong answer on the first, correct on the second. It is certainly an opinion that bush ahs done a lot to help AQ. I believe you will find it impossible, when considering the fact in the case, like the boost to their funding and recruitment caused by our war of agression in Iraq, to refute the opinion, buthey, you are apparently a new breed of unthinking conservative. You are told what to think and what to believe and form your opinions not by analyzing evidence, but by listening to sound bytes by people you like. Moral restraint. You may not know what it means, but you sure like the way it sounds!! YES.....YES.....moral restraint.....that sounds like a good thing.....family values....yes, we like that too...... Don't actually have to write a speech, just read of a list of meaningless buzz terms and you are happy. Don't have to HAVE any moral restraint. don't have to actually do anything to SUPPORT family values. Don't actually have to take any real steps to DEFEND the country. You just seem to like phrases like ""Moral restraint"", ""Family Values"" and ""strong defense"". Yes, you are correct on both counts. It is a partial quote, and it is fuzzy liberal talking points. It coms from Rumsfeld, who said on multiple occasions that ""Us troops will be met in the cities of Iraq with flowers and they will greet democracy with open arms"". With ovewr 80% of the cities int eh building either destroyed or uninhabitable due to damage incured during our bombing raids and ""liberation"". I would say we have done a damn fine job of leveling the city. Of course, it won't truly be level until next month when we bring in the bulldozers to knock down the remnants of the buildings (right now it is not level, there are piles of rubble all over the place). After the bulldozers, of course, will come the hundreds of millions of US taxpayer money to rebuild the buildings we blew up (or 1.2 billion, depending on how technical you want ot get). Yes, but for different reasons. I find answering your posts kind of boring and tedius because you fail to present any kind of argument at all to back up your stance. You just spout rediculous, unsupported (and in many cases unsupportable) rhetoric.","religious-war","08:12 PM","government-debates","58"

Why do so many other equally knowledgeable economists not agree with you? You guys can't even agree if it's a good idea to cut taxes or not. A successful economy is largely about the public ATTITUDE.","daewoo","79675","Yes, certainly, because as the dollar drops like a rock and money flies out of this country at an astonishing rate never to return, due both to our incredible trade deficit and our recent bout of nation building, it is really public attitude that makes the difference. Wake up. If there is no money, it doens't matter how good your attitude is. Yiou cannot run an economy without money. Where do you come up with this drivel? This is not a matter of fear mongering. This is a case where you should be afraid. This is also not a question of different interpetations. This is a simple matter of addition and subtraction. We are spending more than we are making on a national level. Our balance sheet has been negative for decades now. I seriously, serously doubt you can find even an entry level economist or for that matter anybody who knows how to figure a balance sheet who would disagree with the basic assesment put forth here: If you run a negative balance sheet long enough, you run out of money. I realise this is another part of your bold new conservatism, ignoring all available evidence in deference to blind optimism, but it is really not a good policy.","religious-war","09:02 PM","government-debates","59"
