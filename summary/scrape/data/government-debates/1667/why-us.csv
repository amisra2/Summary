I am genuinely interested in hearing reasons other than the sarcastic ""Because they believe they are the world's police."" Surely that isnt really true. (?)Maybe one of you knows... How does the United States justify its posession of weapons of mass destruction, while simutanously insisiting that all other countries dismantle their nuclear weapons? This strikes me as an attitude of superiority and a hypocritical one at that, since the US is the only country to have used this kind of weapon on another nation (yet). To my mind, the US doesnt have a superior right to ""protect itself"", while stripping other countries of the same right.","why-us","11:40 AM","government-debates","1"

Of course it's a threat to us B. They're developing nations... in many cases their populations are starving so the government can fund development.","why-us","05:33 PM","government-debates","2"

But if a third world dictator, who has a starving population decides he wants those types of weapons, then no, thats wrong and i think all developed nations should put a stop to such countries.","why-us","05:59 PM","government-debates","3"

Shouldn't the United States take more steps to eliminate its nuclear arsenal as an incentive to the rest of the world to abandon nuclear weapons? After all, we are part of the Non-Proliferation Treaty--wasn't that set up to rid the world of nuclear threat?","why-us","06:28 PM","government-debates","4"
"01-30-2004","1667",1,"None","None","None","Broker","33157","Of proliferation... We can't just get rid of our nukes. The only reason they've been used once is because we were the only ones who had them at the time. If the Germans or Russians had developed their nuclear weapons in time WW II would be quite different... that's just inviting everyone to threaten us. Imagine a world where a third world nation could develop nuclear weapons and be uncountered. They could extort money, technology, international support, etc, etc.","why-us","07:01 PM","government-debates","5"

Your ""do as I say-not as I do"" must then imply that we ourselves are undeveloped or unstable. If this is not the case, which it isn't based on comparison to the world today, then your example doesn't work. Since the NPT took effect the US has eliminated 60% of its nuclear weapons and has only 60% of their currently nuclear weapons active while Russia actually increased the number of nuclear weapons by 54%, France increased theirs by 872%, and China increased theirs by an estimated 433%. Great Britain is actually the only other nuclear power to actually lower the number of nuclear weapons since 1970 and they only did so by 29%. Currently the US has around 10,000 nuclear weapons and if memory serves they plan on having as few as 8,000 by 2010 in accordance with a plan to lower nuclear stockpiles recently agreed upon by Bush and Putin. http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/nudb/datab19.asp http://www.fpif.org/briefs/vol6/v6n3...duct_body.html It is the long term goal of the NPT to eliminate nuclear weapons but realistically I doubt that can ever happen. At least some progress is being made and the nuclear powers of the world are working towards reducing the amount of nuclear weapons they have on hand. However if some rogue nation was to develop and use a nuclear weapon it would throw a major wrench into any chance of the NPT's goal ever coming close to being recognized.","why-us","07:07 PM","government-debates","6"
"02-01-2004","1667",1,"None","None","None","hvozdany","33421","I agree that there is a certain hyprocacy to what we say although most would agree that the spread of neclear weapons is not a good thing, and many would argue that having such a large nuclear arsenal (as well as Russia having one) may have prevented a war between the two countries, with the theory of assured mutual distruction. I think that the more alarming trend is ignoring nuclear proliferation treaties that we have signed. The Bush administration's consideration of building nuclear ""bunker busters"" is seen by some as violating article VI of the NPT: Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control. Of course the article is vague enough that there is room to try to justify, but in the eyes of the world, we may not be setting a good example. The other noteworthy treaty with respect to nuclear disamerment is, of course, the abandonment of the 1972 Anti Ballistic Missle Treaty signed with Russia.","why-us","01:25 PM","government-debates","7"
