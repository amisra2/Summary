This shows our military is VERY weak. How can we allow our soldiers to go out and rape and kill a family of the Iraqis?!? What were they thinking if we have people this stupid in our military how could we win any REAL war here at home. I'm outraged this was allowed to happen I would hope any commanding officers at that post are all dishonorably discharge there is no excuse for what they allowed to happen under their command. I would hope if we are going to rape and kill innocent people our military would be the ones to be able to get away with it, seems thats not the case here.","outraged-about-us-soldiers-rape-murder","01:01 PM","government-debates","1"
"08-07-2006","8652",1,"emclean","None","i hope you do not think that our military personal should be alowed to get away with rape or murder.","danjrush04","226637","Not at all was I insinuating that I think they should be able to get away with it. However I am a smart person and I know how males are. Put a bunch of males together in a foreign place and make them go a year without having sex with a female. You'd have to be very blind not to think lust would overcome them at some point. Furthermore you'd have to assume it's going to happen and if it's going to happen you would hope that the people committing the dishonorably act to at least get away with it to up hold the military creed. We all know their is corruption in our military, I'm just stating I realize it will happen no matter what you think or believe, just stating I wish they were at least smart enough to get away with it, what we don't know won't hurt them in this case our relation with the Iraqi people. I realize this is making me look pro rape/murder but that's simply not that case as I stated all of those commanding officers should ALSO be dishonorably discharged.","outraged-about-us-soldiers-rape-murder","02:09 PM","government-debates","3"
"08-07-2006","8652",1,"emclean","None","then i miss understood the last bit of the original post. i would dissagree on the commanding officers being dishonorably discharged, the ptl. leader and CO should posabily loose there command (depending on weather or not they should have expected some dissaplin issues from thees troops), and receve some punishment for the troops drinking. the command higher than that are not expected to know what all the troops are doing, that is fro the lower officers to keep in line. a dishonorably discharge would distroy the rest of there lives, in most of the commanding officers cases is was not there jobs to keep those guys in line.","danjrush04","226673","Ok no problem let me know if I need to re explain it to you but I'm guessing you figured out what I was going for. Ok given I know no one in the military or how it really all works as I have never really cared about it I admit I probably have shown some lack of knowledge. However when you join the military it is a job where they pay you to perform a service. Therefore making it a business ran by the government. If anything the real world business rules should apply to the military. Meaning lets say your working at wal-mart and your the guy/gal who walks around keeping things clean, sorted, stocked and helping customers. Now lets say since your 17 you really could care a less about your job so you slack off. Now lets say your supervisor allows this slack off lots of times and each time he does you slack off even more not being afraid of getting into trouble. Then one day you take it to the extreme, clock in and leave an go back home and go to sleep. This is reported to the GM of the store and lets say just for theories sake the GM does nothing. Now we have a huge snowball effect here, we are getting pretty high into the company where people don't care about what is going on either because they hate their job, their life, or they hate the companies ideas. This should of NEVER been allowed to happen. I would discharge the recruiter who recruited these people, the drill instructor, ect. everyone who had anything to do with this that allowed murders and rapist into our military force. Like I said this story proves to me just how stupid our military is...... can you really rely on people like this to protect the American people?","outraged-about-us-soldiers-rape-murder","04:17 PM","government-debates","5"

Read it and comprehend it well and tell me nothing drastically needs to be done here. This one action (what the soldiers did) could spark the idea the whole time we have been Iraq all we have been doing is stealing, rapping, murdering and up to no good in their country.

In a place like Iraq, where a majority of the local populace considers American military at a level below vermin, I'd have to think unreported, covered-up instances would be extremely high. Especially when all witnesses are easily killed by identifying them as insurgents or whatever catchy name is currently being employed for resistance to democracy. Let's face facts. Our current volunteer military is composed primarily of individuals who were issued an automatic weapon, some training, given lots of promises of a glorious, educated future life and took that job as opposed to their other options, flipping burgers or unemployment. We're not talking Rhodes Scholars. Cannon fodder requires a lot of supervision when their leadership is pursuing an unjust cause and the cannon fodder are the ones being spit on.","outraged-about-us-soldiers-rape-murder","07:53 PM","government-debates","8"

I give the United States of America 21 years before its collapse. At the rate our country is going and how we deal with current issues I see no reason why I'm wrong to think our country will be no more in 21 years. I say we need change and we need it soon. I won't stand and support our military if it's overseas killing innocents, rapping, murdering and ruining lives of innocent people just so I don't have to pay 10$ per gallon. I'd rather see our country go bankrupt see huge chaos in our own country, then JUST maybe then our leaders will think to themselves hey looks like our country has its own problems maybe we should be working on ours and not others.","outraged-about-us-soldiers-rape-murder","08:43 PM","government-debates","10"

"08-08-2006","8652",1,"emclean","None","and you know this from years of service? there aint no sutch thing as a dumb grunt anymore. i knew a few guys who were a few cards short of a deck, but the marjorty were people with a lot on the ball.","georged","226782","Difficult for me to consider someone choosing a vocation with the possibility of death/disablement, inflexible obedience structure and no training that can be transferred to the civilian world as having a lot on the ball. I realize there are always exceptions, but given the criteria for voluntary enlistment versus civilian job availability at high school graduation age I see military pay and benefits as being raised to a level that absorbs many who would have worked in a manufacturing or assembly environment prior to the US industrial decline.","outraged-about-us-soldiers-rape-murder","09:35 AM","government-debates","14"
"08-08-2006","8652",1,"None","None","None","danjrush04","226826","I've came to what I think is a reasonable solution to our problem here. Let's face the facts these guys are over there seeing headless bodies shipped back to their post and lots of other things we/they should never see. I think you would all agree with me that after seeing this type of stuff for even 6 months you would start to go a bit crazy maybe even insane. Now for our solution. We have a small force of psychologists that have NOTHING to do with the military no training no nothing its a thrid party that gets involved. They simply check the soldiers by sitting down with them in an environment that is safe and just talk to the soldiers and find out if they are still mentally healthy to be in combat and if not they are simply sent back out of combat. Now I realize this will bring up a few points that would make this hard 1. being how many people would try to fake it just to get out of combat. 2. lost my train of thought but I'm sure there are more holes in this plan. Regardless though if our psychologists were good enough they should be able to figure out who is really healthy and who is not even if the soldiers were trying to lie to them. Tell me what you think? P.S. I did go out and talk to a soldier who recently got back and he told me some of the stuff they have to deal with over there and you would have to assume after enough of seeing things like that you too would go a bit crazy or mad.","outraged-about-us-soldiers-rape-murder","12:40 PM","government-debates","15"
