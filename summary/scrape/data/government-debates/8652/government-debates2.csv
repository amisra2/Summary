That doesn't mean I personally admire all choices on how to accomplish same. I know cops, truck drivers, etc., but that's not something I would have chosen as a career. I've been out of it for some time, but other than lifer officers and draftees who had their educations interrupted I never knew anyone with a volunteer military service record who was hired for a middle management position with a major corporation, though I'd think defense and other government associated businesses would be obvious exceptions. Most lacked the formal credential of a degree. I'm sure there are bright people who worked in manufacturing, may still be in what manufacturing is left. Unless things have changed, it was a very rare occasion when someone was promoted from the floor into management as again, they lacked the credentials. Again, each person makes choices. That doesn't mean their choices are suitable for or admired by everyone.","outraged-about-us-soldiers-rape-murder","05:41 PM","government-debates","18"

Slow down boy. You shooting bullets right at me. Don't make you tell you how many BIG powerful business were started by non college education people. As we all know college is a business, they make money therefore they can be considered a business. College is what we are taught from day one in KD that we have to have to be successful. This is simply not true. In my opinion college is the biggest scam ever. Not only are the customers (the students) told they, in a way they have to buy your service (4 years at college) and if they won't, they will become nothing. You watch yourself saying the above quote, anyone without credentials has the power to start any business they wish, someone who goes to college is brainwashed into being a well educated, well prepared (in theory) for a ""Real"" life job as a employee. The ones who took the less travel road and know what they want in life will become the employers just because they already see life from another point of view.","outraged-about-us-soldiers-rape-murder","11:14 PM","government-debates","19"

That's not at all what I intended, I'm not raciest at all, in fact I love all people, the only hate I have is for our government. When I said boy I was simply implying that I thought you were completely wrong to say what you did and if you noticed you hit a soft spot on me about an issue I believe strongly in. Calling you boy meant you know little about the subject that you were trying to talk about, not that you worked on my plantation. Again I'm not raciest at all I think all people are equal, and should be treated equal, however our government doesn't look at it this way why not get mad at them? Look at New Orleans, still not better yet..... don't start the little raciest XXXX with me why don't you use that energy and try to change the way our government treats minorities!","outraged-about-us-soldiers-rape-murder","11:08 AM","government-debates","23"

My father always believed that all males should pull at least four years in the military after HS to serve thier country. He changed his view on that when Bush got elected . My daughter just passed her two year recall option , Thank God after a six year stint with the army. I can tell you things certainly have changed in the military . My daughter is a pharmacist , now though no thanks to the military as a matter of fact her college class's were dropped twice due to the military never bothering to pay the bills. Not to mention a lot of these kids were told they could go to Iraq and come right back to where they were in thier studies when they left and are finding out thats a joke. setting them back years. It took her eight years to get the degree, because the Army kept interfering. Two of my brothers were in thier 12 th years , one with the Army and one with the Air force when they were forced out in cost cutting measures. in the 90's . yep that can be blamed on Clinton, But Bush is actually worse , he believes in cost cutting when they are no longer useful the way big business does. besides the fact he believes in starting a war before the troops are properly eguipped for thier own saftey. So all of Washington has shown they care little for the lives of soldiers. They are now running the military like a business and downsizing and cut backs are normal . They'd like to have my brothers back , now that they are at war as well as many others they forced out so they wouldn't have to pay retirements on them. Fat chance! My daughter does some volunteer time at a VA hospital along with my youngest son who's a Orthopedic Surgeon. Anybody who works in the VA system will tell you after they bust out of Walter Reed , forget it they are under staffed and under funded. Just a FYI so you don't get to thinking they value soldiers , lifes or well being. They don't its aparent to even old retired Marine SGT's like my father now days. Oh sure they want them after they are educated, they wanted both my sons after they got thier degrees , but thank God thier papa had wisened up and as much as he hated to say it , because the Marines were his life long pride and joy he advised both his grandsons , not to join. Just a FYI for you ,many life long military families see the lack of concern for the soldiers as proof they should not volunteer thier lives for men who don't place a value on them.","outraged-about-us-soldiers-rape-murder","12:14 PM","government-debates","25"

"03-11-2008","8652",2,"danjrush04","226637","Not at all was I insinuating that I think they should be able to get away with it. However I am a smart person and I know how males are. Put a bunch of males together in a foreign place and make them go a year without having sex with a female. You'd have to be very blind not to think lust would overcome them at some point. Furthermore you'd have to assume it's going to happen and if it's going to happen you would hope that the people committing the dishonorably act to at least get away with it to up hold the military creed. We all know their is corruption in our military, I'm just stating I realize it will happen no matter what you think or believe, just stating I wish they were at least smart enough to get away with it, what we don't know won't hurt them in this case our relation with the Iraqi people. I realize this is making me look pro rape/murder but that's simply not that case as I stated all of those commanding officers should ALSO be dishonorably discharged.","CUNxTime","305289","You've got to be kidding! Men can't control themselves? Lust will overcome us? And the VERY few bad apples DON""T get away with it because we don't tolerate that sort of behavior. Pure statistics show that for every 100000 people a certain number of rapes will be committed and I'm confident that the cases/100K of rape when dealing with military people is less then an average 100K people in country! There's SOME corruption in ANY organization, from the UN to the Catholic church!

Comparing Military and Civilian Rape Rates To place military rape rates in context, it is valuable to compare them with civilian rates. Comparisons of the crime rates of civilian and military populations during peacetime periods in 198692 reveal that contemporary peacetime rates of rape by American military personnel are actually lower (controlling for age and gender) than civilian rates. However, the data also indicate that peacetime military rape rates are diminished far less from civilian rates than are military rates for other violent offenses. This rape differential is also reflected in the World War II data: U.S. Army rape rates in Europe climbed to several times the U.S. civilian rates for that period, while military rates for other violent crimes were roughly equivalent to civilian rates. Thus, in both contexts studied, a rape differential exists: the ratio of military rape rates to civilian rape rates is substantially larger than the ratio of military rates to civilian rates for other violent crimes http://www.answers.com/topic/rape-by-military-personnel Other violent crimes violent crimes in general by today's vets who are out of the military... So, using the lowest of the lowball numbers -- 121 acts of mayhem out of 700,000 veterans spread over six years yields a rate of 17.28/100,000 veterans overall. But the New York Times numbers are misleading. This is because with that 121, we now learn that they included 22 cases of DUI, two cases of speeding, three situations which even the prosecution said were handgun accidents, and most incredibly, five cases where the accused was completely exonerated or their actions were determined (in a trial) to be in self-defense. So subtracting those out and the actual number that should be considered is 12.7/100,000. But that would be for a single year, and this needs to be spread out over six years. Mind you, that is also if you stick with the probably low 700,000 number of total Iraq/Afghanistan vets. Mind you we should also look at those stationed elsewhere. Let's try Japanoned! SOFA personnel comprise approximately 3.9 percent of the populating and committed about 1.7 percent of crimes (average, 1972-2001), or about half as much crime compared to the entire population of Okinawa. In the past ten years of data (1992-2001) SOFA personnel committed only 0.82 percent of crimes in Okinawa, or nearly five times less than the general population.
