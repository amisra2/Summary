This shows our military is VERY weak. How can we allow our soldiers to go out and rape and kill a family of the Iraqis?!? What were they thinking if we have people this stupid in our military how could we win any REAL war here at home. I'm outraged this was allowed to happen I would hope any commanding officers at that post are all dishonorably discharge there is no excuse for what they allowed to happen under their command. I would hope if we are going to rape and kill innocent people our military would be the ones to be able to get away with it, seems thats not the case here.","outraged-about-us-soldiers-rape-murder","01:01 PM","government-debates","1"

However I am a smart person and I know how males are. Put a bunch of males together in a foreign place and make them go a year without having sex with a female. You'd have to be very blind not to think lust would overcome them at some point. Furthermore you'd have to assume it's going to happen and if it's going to happen you would hope that the people committing the dishonorably act to at least get away with it to up hold the military creed. We all know their is corruption in our military, I'm just stating I realize it will happen no matter what you think or believe, just stating I wish they were at least smart enough to get away with it, what we don't know won't hurt them in this case our relation with the Iraqi people. I realize this is making me look pro rape/murder but that's simply not that case as I stated all of those commanding officers should ALSO be dishonorably discharged.","outraged-about-us-soldiers-rape-murder","02:09 PM","government-debates","3"
"08-07-2006","8652",1,"emclean","None","then i miss understood the last bit of the original post. i would dissagree on the commanding officers being dishonorably discharged, the ptl. leader and CO should posabily loose there command (depending on weather or not they should have expected some dissaplin issues from thees troops), and receve some punishment for the troops drinking. the command higher than that are not expected to know what all the troops are doing, that is fro the lower officers to keep in line. a dishonorably discharge would distroy the rest of there lives, in most of the commanding officers cases is was not there jobs to keep those guys in line.","danjrush04","226673","Ok no problem let me know if I need to re explain it to you but I'm guessing you figured out what I was going for. Ok given I know no one in the military or how it really all works as I have never really cared about it I admit I probably have shown some lack of knowledge. However when you join the military it is a job where they pay you to perform a service. Therefore making it a business ran by the government. If anything the real world business rules should apply to the military. Meaning lets say your working at wal-mart and your the guy/gal who walks around keeping things clean, sorted, stocked and helping customers. Now lets say since your 17 you really could care a less about your job so you slack off. Now lets say your supervisor allows this slack off lots of times and each time he does you slack off even more not being afraid of getting into trouble. Then one day you take it to the extreme, clock in and leave an go back home and go to sleep. This is reported to the GM of the store and lets say just for theories sake the GM does nothing. Now we have a huge snowball effect here, we are getting pretty high into the company where people don't care about what is going on either because they hate their job, their life, or they hate the companies ideas. This should of NEVER been allowed to happen. I would discharge the recruiter who recruited these people, the drill instructor, ect. everyone who had anything to do with this that allowed murders and rapist into our military force. Like I said this story proves to me just how stupid our military is...... can you really rely on people like this to protect the American people?","outraged-about-us-soldiers-rape-murder","04:17 PM","government-debates","5"

In a place like Iraq, where a majority of the local populace considers American military at a level below vermin, I'd have to think unreported, covered-up instances would be extremely high. Especially when all witnesses are easily killed by identifying them as insurgents or whatever catchy name is currently being employed for resistance to democracy. Let's face facts. Our current volunteer military is composed primarily of individuals who were issued an automatic weapon, some training, given lots of promises of a glorious, educated future life and took that job as opposed to their other options, flipping burgers or unemployment. We're not talking Rhodes Scholars. Cannon fodder requires a lot of supervision when their leadership is pursuing an unjust cause and the cannon fodder are the ones being spit on.","outraged-about-us-soldiers-rape-murder","07:53 PM","government-debates","8"

Let's face the facts these guys are over there seeing headless bodies shipped back to their post and lots of other things we/they should never see. I think you would all agree with me that after seeing this type of stuff for even 6 months you would start to go a bit crazy maybe even insane. Now for our solution. We have a small force of psychologists that have NOTHING to do with the military no training no nothing its a thrid party that gets involved. They simply check the soldiers by sitting down with them in an environment that is safe and just talk to the soldiers and find out if they are still mentally healthy to be in combat and if not they are simply sent back out of combat. Now I realize this will bring up a few points that would make this hard 1. being how many people would try to fake it just to get out of combat. 2. lost my train of thought but I'm sure there are more holes in this plan. Regardless though if our psychologists were good enough they should be able to figure out who is really healthy and who is not even if the soldiers were trying to lie to them. Tell me what you think? P.S. I did go out and talk to a soldier who recently got back and he told me some of the stuff they have to deal with over there and you would have to assume after enough of seeing things like that you too would go a bit crazy or mad.","outraged-about-us-soldiers-rape-murder","12:40 PM","government-debates","15"

Most lacked the formal credential of a degree. I'm sure there are bright people who worked in manufacturing, may still be in what manufacturing is left.

My father always believed that all males should pull at least four years in the military after HS to serve thier country. He changed his view on that when Bush got elected . My daughter just passed her two year recall option , Thank God after a six year stint with the army. I can tell you things certainly have changed in the military . My daughter is a pharmacist , now though no thanks to the military as a matter of fact her college class's were dropped twice due to the military never bothering to pay the bills. Not to mention a lot of these kids were told they could go to Iraq and come right back to where they were in thier studies when they left and are finding out thats a joke. setting them back years. It took her eight years to get the degree, because the Army kept interfering. Two of my brothers were in thier 12 th years , one with the Army and one with the Air force when they were forced out in cost cutting measures. in the 90's . yep that can be blamed on Clinton, But Bush is actually worse , he believes in cost cutting when they are no longer useful the way big business does. besides the fact he believes in starting a war before the troops are properly eguipped for thier own saftey. So all of Washington has shown they care little for the lives of soldiers. They are now running the military like a business and downsizing and cut backs are normal . They'd like to have my brothers back , now that they are at war as well as many others they forced out so they wouldn't have to pay retirements on them. Fat chance! My daughter does some volunteer time at a VA hospital along with my youngest son who's a Orthopedic Surgeon. Anybody who works in the VA system will tell you after they bust out of Walter Reed , forget it they are under staffed and under funded. Just a FYI so you don't get to thinking they value soldiers , lifes or well being. They don't its aparent to even old retired Marine SGT's like my father now days. Oh sure they want them after they are educated, they wanted both my sons after they got thier degrees , but thank God thier papa had wisened up and as much as he hated to say it , because the Marines were his life long pride and joy he advised both his grandsons , not to join. Just a FYI for you ,many life long military families see the lack of concern for the soldiers as proof they should not volunteer thier lives for men who don't place a value on them.","outraged-about-us-soldiers-rape-murder","12:14 PM","government-debates","25"

Comparing Military and Civilian Rape Rates To place military rape rates in context, it is valuable to compare them with civilian rates. Comparisons of the crime rates of civilian and military populations during peacetime periods in 198692 reveal that contemporary peacetime rates of rape by American military personnel are actually lower (controlling for age and gender) than civilian rates. However, the data also indicate that peacetime military rape rates are diminished far less from civilian rates than are military rates for other violent offenses. This rape differential is also reflected in the World War II data: U.S. Army rape rates in Europe climbed to several times the U.S. civilian rates for that period, while military rates for other violent crimes were roughly equivalent to civilian rates. Thus, in both contexts studied, a rape differential exists: the ratio of military rape rates to civilian rape rates is substantially larger than the ratio of military rates to civilian rates for other violent crimes http://www.answers.com/topic/rape-by-military-personnel Other violent crimes violent crimes in general by today's vets who are out of the military... So, using the lowest of the lowball numbers -- 121 acts of mayhem out of 700,000 veterans spread over six years yields a rate of 17.28/100,000 veterans overall. But the New York Times numbers are misleading. This is because with that 121, we now learn that they included 22 cases of DUI, two cases of speeding, three situations which even the prosecution said were handgun accidents, and most incredibly, five cases where the accused was completely exonerated or their actions were determined (in a trial) to be in self-defense. So subtracting those out and the actual number that should be considered is 12.7/100,000. But that would be for a single year, and this needs to be spread out over six years. Mind you, that is also if you stick with the probably low 700,000 number of total Iraq/Afghanistan vets. Mind you we should also look at those stationed elsewhere. Let's try Japanoned! SOFA personnel comprise approximately 3.9 percent of the populating and committed about 1.7 percent of crimes (average, 1972-2001), or about half as much crime compared to the entire population of Okinawa. In the past ten years of data (1992-2001) SOFA personnel committed only 0.82 percent of crimes in Okinawa, or nearly five times less than the general population.
