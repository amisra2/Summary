"06-06-2004","2465",2,"Shooterman","None","Following this debate between two obviously bright and articulate posters, has been enlightening. Don't necessarily completely agree with everything, but felt I must respond to this particular idea. First, just a tad of background. I grew up in a fundamental Christian Church. Was taught early and long that the earth and civilization was 6000 years old, and basically, as a kid, you ecept that. As I grew older, went to college, and for a few years, I had a problem with reconciling this 6000 year old idea with the evidendences of many eons of existance. I warred with this in my own soul for a long while, and one day some preacher, can't even remember his name reminded me of the first few passages in Genesis. In the beginning the earth was void and without form, and God's spirit roamed over the face of the earth. I'm paraphrasing now, so I hope no one get's their panties in a bunch. Another passage said a thousand years is as a day, why not a million years, or a billion. The point being, however long it took for God to build this marvelous world, and however he stocked it with various forms of life, is basically immaterial in the great scheme of things. Why should I doubt either the evolutionary process or the creative process whereby God inbued a spirit or soul unto man. All of this tediousness, if you have followed at all is to say this. Why can't creationism ( the Creation by God ) be taught alongside and in conjunction with evolution. They do not conflict at all. One explains the will of God, and the other explains his method of accomplishing that will. This may be hioghly controversial, but to me, it is simple and straightforward. Now, you gentlemen can go back to y'alls excellent discussion.","daewoo","53141","Personally, I have no real problem with this. If they could blend the two in such a manner that the kids don't have to learn two entirely different theories (since, as I said, they don't seem to be picking up on the one), this owuld be an ideal solution from my standpoint. The PC nazis are unlikely to let this happen. They would throw an absolute fit, as they do with any mentiong of the word ""God"" in a public facility. Our high school dram club did a production of.....hell, I can't remember the name now. It is right on the end of my tougn. scrooge, and the three gosts...you know the one. Anyway, we had the only tiny tim I have ever seen that didn't say ""and god bless us, every one"" at the end of the play. Originally, he was going to, but apparently the PC nazis took offense to tiny tim mentioning God in a play funded by the school. There was some question about wether it was an acceptable choice as a play in any case, since it was about christmas (a christian holiday). If we can't slip that by the PC nazis, I SERIOUSLY doubt we could get a plan like you describe by them.","why-i-am-against-federalism","10:52 AM","government-debates","16"

Of course, you have already realized both sides would find this unacceptable, as they should. Some fundamentalists are willing to stretch the time line to 10,000 years, but that's about it, and they certainly have a loud and respected voice in this country despite what some may think. Other than that, I don't know what a PC nazi is.","why-i-am-against-federalism","04:11 PM","government-debates","18"

While it would definatly end the creation/evolution debate (since neither of them is really solid enough be called ""fact""), it would also cut chemistry, physics, etc... very short since a lof of physics is based on assuming that Einsten was right and that E does in fact equal MC squared. Precios little is actually ""fact"". Most of what we ""know"" is simply well documented conjecture. A PC nazi is almost always a white middle class liberal XXXXX. These are the folks that make sure everything we say or do is politically correct. These are the folks who yell in outrage if you call a black guy a black guy inst4ead of an African American. These are the folks who sue to have a little cross that has been there for over a hundred years off a city seal, despite the fact that nobody has complained about it. The PC nazis are the ones who ""allowed"" a moment of silence in the Shawnee Mission school district, but only if students were instructed NOT to pray during that moment. The PC nazis are also the ones who advoact re-writing classical literature in order to remove racial slurs (replacing them of course with their updated politically correct terms). they are the ones who oppose reading books like ""Huckleberry fin"" and ""Uncle Toms Cabin"" in school. they are the ones who raid our libraries looking for materials they find objectionable, then asking that they be removed or edited. The Politically correct are killers. They are the ones who prevented the CDC from portraying aids as a gay problem and focusing their treatment and prevention efforts at that community when aids first appeared (at which point over 90% of known aids cases were in gay men). They are the ones who step in to prevent schools from teaching abstinence to teenage girls, they are the ones who sue to keep publicly funded anti-gang programs from targeting Black and Hispanic youth (the two groups that account for over 80% of gang reated activity) since they feel that by targeting these programs at those particular ethnic groups we are effectively ""blaming"" them for the problem. The PC nazis are the ones who shut down HUNDREDS of privatly funded gun safety classes. They are the same folks who, locally, oppose public buildings being used for hunting and trapping education calsses, despite the calsses are government run. The PC nazis are the keepers of the flame of liberalism and social justice. They apparently feel a great debt to society to ensure that we are a disarmed, raceless, godless society of soy bean eaters who live in strictly enforced harmony with our fellow man and all of nature. these are the folks who brought abotu the Americans with Disabilities Act, that requires special (and expensive) accomodations in all public buildings. This act requires things like elevators in firehouses for all those firefighters in wheelchairs, and has put countless small businesses who cannot afford compliance out of business.","why-i-am-against-federalism","06:07 PM","government-debates","19"

Gravity, for example, is still a theory in the pure reasoning of science, despite it working every time it is tried. But if something began to levitate unexpectedly, scientists would gladly be of the mind to examine it, and either replace or tweak the theory of gravity to encompass this new occurance. We teach theories in our schools and they are clearly labeled as such. Not so with creationism, IMO. I've never heard it referred to as a theory, and its ""facts"" are pretty much chiseled in stone. Then you understand the idea of incrementalism, where slowly but surely new laws and regulations come into being one small step at a time. It is why the NRA is so effective year in and year out: They understand the fight is won or lost there, and they willingly fight the small wars. I approve of their method. But it is no different than removing a ten commandments monument in some backwater town. People who want a secular society know where to fight that war. There is no doubt in my mind that America would slide into a theocracy if extreme vigilance is not maintained. We've been there before, and I can assure you it does not work.","why-i-am-against-federalism","09:18 PM","government-debates","20"

Also, if there is another law based on the principal (like newtons second is based on the principal of the Law of universal gravitation) the primary principal must be a law. You cannot base a law on a theory. Sarwins theory of evolution, Einsteins theory of relativety, etc.. Are just that, theories. I think you are pushing the religous folks a little hard. They believe that this is what happened, but even many really religous folks don't push it as ""the way the bible says it is exactly how it happened, took 6 days and only happened 10,000 yrs ago"". of course, there are some who think this way, but I think by no means the majority. The NRA is effective because they have 200 yrs of tradition, not to mention a constitutional ammendment backing them. They have been teaching gun safety classes since theri very inception (this is originally what they were created to do). Lately the same folks who like to point to accidental shootings and say ""My god, we need to outlaw guns"" have been attacking the NRA for teaching gun safety classes to boy scouts and summer camp kids. Personally, i see society going the other way. I think we are becoming a godless people. Until just recently (last 50 yrs or so) the ten commandments was in full display at MANY county courthouses (we had it in the courthouse here until just 4 years ago). Our public leders often used religous principals to justify decisions they made. In the last 50 yrs (really the last 20) people seem to have decided that freedom of religion really means freedom from religion. I don't think this is quite what the founders had in mind. I personally prefer to deal with religous folks in business. I don't particularly care what religion (in general, though there are some weird ones out there). I simply prefer to deal with folks that have been taught a well defined set of morals as opposed to a non religous type, in which case you never know exactly where they get their morals. It doesn;t hurt that most major religions teach that if you cheat, lie, wahtever, you will end up in hell or somewhere equally nasty. Our entire system is based ont eh principals of religion. Our laws are more or less the modern day equivelant of biblical law. This is one of the reasons you get such different legal structures in places like the ME and indonesia (muslim countries) and Asia (buddhists, confucian, Taoist, etc...). Personally, I prefer not to tunr my back on a couple thousand years of tradition and moral values imposed bythe church. I read an interesting report a while back that claimed that childeren raised in the catholic church (I am not talking just christmas and easter here) have lower instances of drug abuse and arrest than those not raised in a religous faith. I would assume that other religions could show similar results. It seems that raising your kids to believe that whether you get caught or not, go dis always watching and you WILL someday have to answer for the things you have done can only be a positive thing. While it is nice to believe that people will do ""the right thing"" based soley on their conscience, it is a bunch of bunk. I have seen a couple of societies break down (most natable sierra leone and rwanda) and the minute risk of punisment is gone, people revert to the self serving, cruel animals that they have always had just beneath that thin cloak of ""civilization"". The exception to this has been the deeply religous folks. i think this is because to them, government or no, the risk of punishment is never gone. They believe they will have to answer for the things they do eithr here on earth or when they die, and the penalty for not doing right is severe (like eternity in hell).","why-i-am-against-federalism","01:33 AM","government-debates","21"

Much like a lot of your last post. I would strongly suggest then that you not do business with the heathens. A well-lit sign clearly posted above your business doors and a business card with bold letters proclaiming your aversion to the non-religious and their money would be a good start. Didn't you just say I was a little hard on the religious folks? If that's the only way you believe you can act civilly then I would prefer you keep your superstitions handy, the carrot and stick routine. I'm not sure why you mentioned Sierra Leone and Rwanda. Both those countries are very religious, Rwanda especially in its Christianity, IIRC. My contention is simple. I believe people can handle the truth, no matter where it leads. I'm not afraid to pursue it, nor am I concerned about anyone else attempting to pursue it. I believe that this society honors facts, and will marshall them in such a way as to find a path we can travel on for the benefit of the majority. If the facts and the path do not lead to some silent, mysterious god, too bad for the god. I also believe humans are better than your depiction. Just look around you, you live in Kansas for pete's sake. I also contend that anyone who harbors a belief in hell, a literal place with fire and sulpher and gnashing of teeth, with eternities of suffering for uncounted billions of people, can never be truly civilized. They hold dear in their hearts the cruelest, meanest thought ever conceived by man, and mix infinity into it.","why-i-am-against-federalism","09:26 AM","government-debates","22"

To what extent is the Constitution a product of its time? Were not the founders human and limited in discerning the future? Is it wise to put them on such a high pedestal, good as they were? For over twenty years I've held the belief of strict constructionism in interpreting the Constitution. It's easy to hold that belief--the written words mean exactly what they say and no more. But then it becomes a dead document, does it not? Have we not become a great society by interpreting the constitution as a living, breathing document, which allows each successive generation a new measure of freedom?","why-i-am-against-federalism","09:43 AM","government-debates","23"
