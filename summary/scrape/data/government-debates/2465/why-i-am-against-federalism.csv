This, oddly enough, is called federalism. It had at its core a very appealing message to me: States are more responsible with our tax dollars and are in a better position to determine what is best for its citizens, as opposed to sending money to the out-of-touch politicians in Washington, D.C. presiding over a bloated budget. The movement has continued to the present, where Republicans today continue to push the ""devolution revolution"", wanting more and more power devolved to the local level, such as school boards, cities and townships. Opposing them are the people who believe in a strong federal government which can best watch over the interests of all people. Even more odder, this could be called statism. This very divided country has had me examining my beliefs closely of late and I'm beginning to become very disenchanted with federalism. Here's my thinking. I don't believe we could ever have become a great nation, striving to give equal rights to all, or provide some common sense measures to protect the environment for instance, with federalism. I find pettiness creeping in at a local level, a way for small-time politicians to push their small-minded agendas. The township supervisors where I live have hardly shed their Neanderthal brows yet, let alone debate the pros and cons of the space program. There is something comforting to travel from state to state and see more uniformity than not. I could easily imagine check stops at each border, being given thick booklets containing myriads of local laws and rules, all the result of some pet project of local politicos. Questions: 1.

Where am I going wrong in my thinking?","daewoo","51960","I think the concept of federalism went (and still goes) much further than simply fiscal control. It is about the sharing of power between a centralised (the federal) and decentralised (the states) government. The idea is not only that people at the state level are more adept at deciding how money should be spent, but also that the states should have more power. If citizens of a state become dissatisfied with their government, they could change it in 3 or 4 years, completely sweeping house and installing new people to all elected positions. This extends to things like law enforcement as well. Our local sheriffs department has a conviction rate that makes the FBI look downright incompetent. The thing is, MOST sheriffs departments in my state have conviction rates that make the FBI look incompetent. The exceptions are out west, in counties that only have a hundred or so people, and have no crime. THey have a conviction rate of either 0 or 100%, depending on how you look at it. They manage this because your local sheriffs department is right there on the ground, every day. They know the people, they know what is going on, and they know who to ask if something is going on that shouldn't be. THey treat the people around here like citizens with rights, because otherwise the sheriff will not be re-elected and he knows it, so he keeps his guys on a leash. At a federal level, the agents don't have the advatages that the local sheriffs department does. We try to make up for this with more and cooler toys and more power for our LE personell. IT doesn't usually work. They also do not have to play nice nearly so much, since they are buffered from the court of public opinion. In my state we have state welfar and social programs. They run without the waste that comes with the federal system. Over 80% of the money that goes into the system ends up helping poor people, with the other 20% running to administraive costs. When was the last time a federal social program ate up less than half the money on administrative costs? If I remember correctly, it was during the depression. But we did become a great nation on a more federalistic system. Right up until WWII, the US was a LOT more federalist than we are now. The government in our coutry ate up only 5% pf the GDP, as opposed to over 50% today. People didn;t recieve as much education in general, but te education they did recieve was of a much higher quality. I read a report not long ago that a member of our local school board had prepared. They took some old tests (circa 1940) and administered them to a bunch of graduating seniors from one of our local high schools. NOt a single one passed the test. This is pathetic. We are supposed to be getting SMARTER. While there can definatly be a problem with local politicians being small minded and pushing a petty agenda, it s also fairly simple to get rid of those guys through democratic processes. We also have politicians pushing small minded agendas and being petty at a national level, and they are MUCH harder to get rid of. This was the genius of the American system. We were suposed to have the best of both worlds. You have local control over many things, programs being run directly within sight of people who are able to pull the plug if it doesn't seem to be working out, and politicians who are also operating under the scrutiny of citizens who can remove them from office easily if they fail to perform. This is democracy. Our founding fathers apparently believed in the wisdom of the population at large to keep such things from happening. Perhaps they were mistaken, becasue our population at large does not seem to be exibitng a lot of wisdom lately. We also have a federal system in place, that does things like handle space programs and make sure that all the different states play nice. They also act as a check on the powers of the state and ensure our rights are recognised by those states. AS far as I know, more or less, though federalism is not at all limited to fiscal matters. It is the sharing of power between the federal government and the states. I think it was a good idea while it lasted. The other major thing that seems to be missing is that you are not talking an either or prposition. you still have a federal government, you just lift some of the burden of governing from them. Dunno I would say no. Others might disagree IMHO you are seeing too many things as black or white. There are many shades of grey. Federalism does not preclude the federal government from operating things like the space program, or the military. It simply shifts some of the power, and some of the burden of governing, to the states. Traditionally, federalists talk about things like shifting social programs to the states. From my experience, this is a good idea. Any time you run any agency, there is going to be waste. In a huge system like the federal welfare program, these are going to be HUGE wastes. In a smaller program such as a state might run, the program is likely to be run far more efficiently just for the fact that it is easier to oversee a smaller program. PErsonally I think that law enforcement should be carried out at a local or state level whenever possible. YOu still need a federal LE agency to handle crimes that take place or involve many different jurisdictions, but the majority of crimes do not fall into such a category. Somebody is going to say that ""we need a large federal LE frce becasue local departments don't have the funding or equipment to handle it on their own"". That person will be wrong. Compare conviction rates of local LE agencies to federal agencies and this becomes quickly apparent. Pick a random local LE agency if you want. I don;t think it really matter which one you pick.","why-i-am-against-federalism","09:15 PM","government-debates","2"

However one problem I do feel with such a system is where a certain act is legal in one state and illegal in another. Surely something is either acceptable or not, and it should be for the government to decide which. To put this into perspective, I used to live in Melbourne, Australia. This was in a State (Victoria) where marijuana was illegal, however just next door in the state of South Australia it is legal. Now firstly this is a very strange state of affairs (no pun intended) to me, either it is harmful and unacceptable or not. Furthermore it appears to put an unfair pressure on the Victorian police, who have to combat something that is legal across not a country border, but just a state one. Making control of smuggling and the like almost impossible I should think.","why-i-am-against-federalism","12:48 PM","government-debates","3"

It isn't an either or thing, it's a balance. But where to put the fulcrum? I'm not comfortable placing it back too much further to the advantage of local politics. (Local law enforcement of course is an exception.) I have my eye more on school boards. If they are allowed more power or autonomy, I think it will be to the detriment of our kids. If a school district is tied to what are the community's standards, then the kids will be at a disadvantage to rise above any prejudices that may be present locally. I see harmful intrusions of small-mindedness in school boards. Kansas recently tried to marginalize evolution in its classrooms in favor of creationism, for instance. That seems pretty high for any type of governmental agency, but if they're doing it, congratulations to your state. The U.S. was also a very racist and misogynistic society previous to WWII. A strong federal government helped a great deal in reversing those trends. I don't believe a weak central government with stronger local level politics could have ever tackled those problems. I took a test from the senior class of 1902 that was found and published in a newspaper. I failed miserably too.

What shocks most people upon their first encounter with a local 'machine' is the sheer amount of economic and social structure power that local money does control. If one takes say a Deep South city or county dominated by conservative Democrats, the personal policies of those who hold the wealth are going to permeate the social structure, business community and belief systems. This will hold true in virtually any established city or county in the US. The major factor in control is always economic, regardless of population demographics including belief systems, educational levels and distribution of wealth below the top tier. Well always have some seemingly dumb as a post representation at all levels because they all owe somebody else for their positions, and those who bestow that political power are doing so to ensure that their personal policies are the defacto governing policies. If you want to know who controls your city, simply identify the democratic/republican committee members and discover who makes the political contributions to the various candidates and PACs. When 25% local registered voter turnout is the norm, a little money goes a long way in ensuring that city remains your personal fiefdom.","why-i-am-against-federalism","09:40 AM","government-debates","6"

And people at the head table other than current politicians are people youll never see in the newspapers or on TV unless it happens to be in the society, business or general interest sections because of a public endowment. Normally their reps, prominent lawyers and powerhouse ad agencies that handle political campaigns represent them. When national committee members zoom in for big buck dinners that status remains constant, usually with the big money in attendance. National meetings have the same recognition of the money people. My in-laws are substantial demo contributors and the pecking order is the same there, though the demo contributors like the limelight more than their opposite numbers. Public interest is terminology, not reality. Politics have always been a combination of money and power, nothing else. Local, national or international, its still driven by money, using the combined force with special interest participation and control determined by contribution levels. No politician really cares who runs the school board, university regents or other day-to-day issues as long as they have a rep to make sure the idealism doesnt get too expensive. The power is in city/county/state/national political administration of public services, where the money is spent.","why-i-am-against-federalism","01:57 PM","government-debates","8"

I live in Kansas, and I am on my local school board, and what the media reported was NOT what happened here. NObody wanted to marginalize evolution, there was a movement to teach creationism in addition to evolution. The only real problem I saw with this is that most of our kids werent picking up on evolution, I didn't see where there was time to deal with creationism. I know in our district, we decided that the thing to do was to teach as we always have, but make sure the teachers reinforce that evolution has not actually been proven (there are severl blank spots in the fossil record). I can see valid points to both arguments on that one. For one, th theory of evolution is just that, a theory, and many people believe i the theory of creationism, which is no less valid. Neither has been proven, and both seem to have some merit. That said, the school board system is SERIOUSLY flawed. There are certain parts of it that could ocncievably be fixed by federalising the system. For one, there are basically no qualifications to be on the school board, unless you head the board. THere are a couple of women on our board who have NO experince outside of being a housewife. Neither has had a job since they were teenagers, and they have (IMNSHO) NO business sitting on a board that will decide the fate of millions of dollars of taxpayer money. The current head of our board has a degree in elementry education, but is wrking as a low level manager at a local phone company. How is he qualified to head a school board? Taking control from local school boards is not real likely to be a popular idea. While it absolutly has its benifits, it also takes control from parents. The whole idea behind the school board was that parents would have immediate control over how their kids are educated. There are also several problems that federalizing would probably make worse. One is that we spend a fortune on ensuring that our schools are politically correct. In my district, we have a large number of hispanic students. Many don't speak english. We are not allowed to have ESL classes, or to require them to learn english. Nor are we allowed to hire spanish speaking teachers and give them their own classes. Instead, we are required to hire a translator for EACH of these kids. We do this in the name of ""equality"". How is spending an extra $30,000.00 per year for these non english speakers equality? Class structure also needs to be addressed. As the strength of a chain is determined by it's weakest link, the speed at which a class is able to cover its material is set byt he slowest pupil. We have managed to implement several advanced classes, but we can't make advanced classes for every sublec out of fear of making some of the slower kids feel inferior. THose are not only good numbers for a government agency, those are good numbers for a private business. But why shouldn't we expect that from our government? They have the laws on their side, after all. Why should we settle for less efficiency that you would see in the private sector? Again, this is why we aren't talking about abolishing the federal government. The federal government should be looked at like a big hammer. You get it out when you have something big to move, then you put it away again. You don't try to drive thumb tacks with a sledge hammer, nor would you attempt to break up your driveway with a tack hammer.

Jefferson was the most vocal critic of big government in his day, yet during his presidency greatly expanded its power and reach, much to the advantage of the country, IMO. My understanding is the state school board tried to abolish the teaching of evolution in the classroom, and did for awhile, until four members of the board lost their reelection bid by the good people of Kansas. FWIW, I think kids may be getting confused with the lesson because we adults have muddied the water. I don't think evolution and creation can be taught side by side, it should be one or the other. It seems the Christians have adopted the strategy of offering creationism as an alternative. This is wrong. They must destroy the idea of evolution first, and they have to do it the way evolution supplanted creationism--by reason. Another reason to think the water is muddy. I'm about to rest my case. I don't want to veer off into that debate however if I can avoid it, but it seems to me that it presents a good case of regional biases and prejudices that our children become indoctrinated with unless we're real careful. Oklahoma I believe puts this disclaimer in it science textbooks: ""Human life was created by one God of the Universe"". To my eyes, that doesn't look like a theory. I seriously question the value of school boards. You obviously disagree, seeing you presently sit on one. I just find them too meddling, and too quick to placate vocal parents. PC run amuck. It is sure nonsense. Well I'm slowly absorbing the lesson.

In the course of teaching evolution, there are a LOT of other scientific prinicipals that I think the kids are likely to pick up on. If you want to teach creationism, take your kids to sunday school. This is not just an issue of religion in school, it is a question of who is more qualified to teach such things. A science teacher is a good chioce for evolution, but I think a priest or minister is a better choice for teaching creationism. I do think that when teachers teach a topic that is mostly conjecture and has not actually been proven, that they should say so. The theory of evolution is just tht, a theory. The fossil record does not fully support it in that they have still not managed to fill in quite a few blank spots (never managed to conclusively trace a modern species to an earlier one). Presenting conjecture as fact is not a good idea, even if the conjecture does seem sound. When I was in college I took a chemistry calss where I learned certain ""rules"" about the bonding of sulfides. Several years later I observed a reaction that broke 3 of the 5 rules we ad been taught. I spent a couple of months trying tio disprove the reaction I had seen right there with my own eyes, becasue I had been taught that it was not possible. You are correct on this point. Kids are likely to pick up regional biases during the course of their education. What is really wrong with this, though? Don't parents have the right to have their children educated as they wish? My primary concern is that the chldren get a good, basic education. Reading, math, science, and history are my concerns. Any social or religous values they pick up in school are a side effect of cramming al those kidds into the building and then putting a teacher in front of them. I have spoken with school administrators and people who specialise in education in other parts of the country (And even in pcertain other parts of the state) and apparently some places the schools make a conscious effort to instill morals and some sense of social values in their kids. Around here, we do not, we figure that is the parents job. The whole ""takes a village to raise a child"" thing is kind of looked at as liberal hogwash around here, even the 20% of people who are registered democrats in my area are possibly more conservative than our current president. I got on the school board because I thought they were too meddling, too wasteful, and too quick to placate the whiner in the back of the room. I think we are making a little progress. The problem seems to be that those who are most interested in doing things like being on the local school board are unfortuantly the same folks who most definatly should NOT be there at all. Most of the school board memebrs on our board are these PC liberals who think that we could solve all our education problems if we just had more money. They think that we hire teachers to teach the kids, and those teachers are professionals who ""know the best way to do things"" but then they refuse to hold those same ""professionals"" who ""know the best way to do things"" responsible when we turn out high school seniors who are functionally illiterate. It is a load of ****. I will admit that I kind of bully our school board around. There are always folks from the pres there who are willing to report discourse and disagreement from the school board. I have no problem with cutting off the head of the board mid sentence when he is saying something stupid and saying ""THAT IS STUPID"". I refuse to go into closed session unless it is explained before we leave the room exactly WHY we are going into closed session. If we DO go into closed session, and talk about something that should be public, I recan the conversation when we get back out into the meeting room so everybody knows what went on (before, over 70% of the itme our school board spent meeting was in closed session). I am the ony conservative on our board, in an area where 80% of the voters are registered republicans. you just can;t get good people to run for the school board, so you end up with local education mirroring colleges, powerhouses of liberal thinking. It is absolut nonsense, and the people who get the angriest about it are NOT te middle class white folks, it is the mexican immigrants who actually have learned to speak english and get along inour society. They think it is an outrage that we let these other kids get by without learning english. you can yell MELTING POT all you want, and as loud as you want, but the simple fact of the matter is, if you want to be sucessful in America, you need to learn to speak english. The job of a school is to teach kids things they can use later in life to help them be sucessful. English should be pretty high on that list. Business in America is conducted in english, not spanish, not ebonics. If you want to be sucessful in American business, you have to master english. Spanish and ebonics (yes, now we have actually NAMED bad english in an attmpt to legitimize it) are fine, but you are not going ot get far in life in the united states without english. I think that federalizing schools may actualy make the PC aspect of them worse. Right now, we have to have the minimum amount of political correctness as required by law and our voters.

If I had to sit on a board I think I would be guided by a most simple maxim: We should not teach our children anything we don't know for sure. On a fiscal note, I heard a report about a Canadian experiment that gave principals responsibility for roughly 80-90% of the budget for their respective buildings.The idea was that they more than anyone else were in the best position to make budgetary decisions. The experiment was a huge success. I was wondering if there is any talk of it being tried in the lower 48?","why-i-am-against-federalism","10:18 PM","government-debates","14"

I don't think evolution and creation can be taught side by side, it should be one or the other. It seems the Christians have adopted the strategy of offering creationism as an alternative. This is wrong. They must destroy the idea of evolution first, and they have to do it the way evolution supplanted creationism--by reason.","Shooterman","53109","Following this debate between two obviously bright and articulate posters, has been enlightening. Don't necessarily completely agree with everything, but felt I must respond to this particular idea. First, just a tad of background. I grew up in a fundamental Christian Church. Was taught early and long that the earth and civilization was 6000 years old, and basically, as a kid, you ecept that. As I grew older, went to college, and for a few years, I had a problem with reconciling this 6000 year old idea with the evidendences of many eons of existance. I warred with this in my own soul for a long while, and one day some preacher, can't even remember his name reminded me of the first few passages in Genesis. In the beginning the earth was void and without form, and God's spirit roamed over the face of the earth. I'm paraphrasing now, so I hope no one get's their panties in a bunch. Another passage said a thousand years is as a day, why not a million years, or a billion. The point being, however long it took for God to build this marvelous world, and however he stocked it with various forms of life, is basically immaterial in the great scheme of things. Why should I doubt either the evolutionary process or the creative process whereby God inbued a spirit or soul unto man. All of this tediousness, if you have followed at all is to say this. Why can't creationism ( the Creation by God ) be taught alongside and in conjunction with evolution. They do not conflict at all. One explains the will of God, and the other explains his method of accomplishing that will. This may be hioghly controversial, but to me, it is simple and straightforward. Now, you gentlemen can go back to y'alls excellent discussion. I don't want to veer off into that debate however if I can avoid it, but it seems to me that it presents a good case of regional biases and prejudices that our children become indoctrinated with unless we're real careful. Oklahoma I believe puts this disclaimer in it science textbooks: ""Human life was created by one God of the Universe"". To my eyes, that doesn't look like a theory. I seriously question the value of school boards. You obviously disagree, seeing you presently sit on one. I just find them too meddling, and too quick to placate vocal parents. PC run amuck. It is sure nonsense. Well I'm slowly absorbing the lesson. It's just that I have my perfect world envisioned and it's difficult to leave it and look at the realities sometimes.[/QUOTE]","why-i-am-against-federalism","08:31 PM","government-debates","15"

Precios little is actually ""fact"". Most of what we ""know"" is simply well documented conjecture. A PC nazi is almost always a white middle class liberal XXXXX. These are the folks that make sure everything we say or do is politically correct. These are the folks who yell in outrage if you call a black guy a black guy inst4ead of an African American. These are the folks who sue to have a little cross that has been there for over a hundred years off a city seal, despite the fact that nobody has complained about it. The PC nazis are the ones who ""allowed"" a moment of silence in the Shawnee Mission school district, but only if students were instructed NOT to pray during that moment. The PC nazis are also the ones who advoact re-writing classical literature in order to remove racial slurs (replacing them of course with their updated politically correct terms). they are the ones who oppose reading books like ""Huckleberry fin"" and ""Uncle Toms Cabin"" in school. they are the ones who raid our libraries looking for materials they find objectionable, then asking that they be removed or edited. The Politically correct are killers. They are the ones who prevented the CDC from portraying aids as a gay problem and focusing their treatment and prevention efforts at that community when aids first appeared (at which point over 90% of known aids cases were in gay men). They are the ones who step in to prevent schools from teaching abstinence to teenage girls, they are the ones who sue to keep publicly funded anti-gang programs from targeting Black and Hispanic youth (the two groups that account for over 80% of gang reated activity) since they feel that by targeting these programs at those particular ethnic groups we are effectively ""blaming"" them for the problem. The PC nazis are the ones who shut down HUNDREDS of privatly funded gun safety classes. They are the same folks who, locally, oppose public buildings being used for hunting and trapping education calsses, despite the calsses are government run. The PC nazis are the keepers of the flame of liberalism and social justice. They apparently feel a great debt to society to ensure that we are a disarmed, raceless, godless society of soy bean eaters who live in strictly enforced harmony with our fellow man and all of nature. these are the folks who brought abotu the Americans with Disabilities Act, that requires special (and expensive) accomodations in all public buildings.

Also, if there is another law based on the principal (like newtons second is based on the principal of the Law of universal gravitation) the primary principal must be a law. You cannot base a law on a theory. Sarwins theory of evolution, Einsteins theory of relativety, etc.. Are just that, theories. I think you are pushing the religous folks a little hard. They believe that this is what happened, but even many really religous folks don't push it as ""the way the bible says it is exactly how it happened, took 6 days and only happened 10,000 yrs ago"". of course, there are some who think this way, but I think by no means the majority. The NRA is effective because they have 200 yrs of tradition, not to mention a constitutional ammendment backing them. They have been teaching gun safety classes since theri very inception (this is originally what they were created to do). Lately the same folks who like to point to accidental shootings and say ""My god, we need to outlaw guns"" have been attacking the NRA for teaching gun safety classes to boy scouts and summer camp kids. Personally, i see society going the other way. I think we are becoming a godless people. Until just recently (last 50 yrs or so) the ten commandments was in full display at MANY county courthouses (we had it in the courthouse here until just 4 years ago). Our public leders often used religous principals to justify decisions they made. In the last 50 yrs (really the last 20) people seem to have decided that freedom of religion really means freedom from religion. I don't think this is quite what the founders had in mind. I personally prefer to deal with religous folks in business. I don't particularly care what religion (in general, though there are some weird ones out there). I simply prefer to deal with folks that have been taught a well defined set of morals as opposed to a non religous type, in which case you never know exactly where they get their morals. It doesn;t hurt that most major religions teach that if you cheat, lie, wahtever, you will end up in hell or somewhere equally nasty. Our entire system is based ont eh principals of religion. Our laws are more or less the modern day equivelant of biblical law. This is one of the reasons you get such different legal structures in places like the ME and indonesia (muslim countries) and Asia (buddhists, confucian, Taoist, etc...). Personally, I prefer not to tunr my back on a couple thousand years of tradition and moral values imposed bythe church. I read an interesting report a while back that claimed that childeren raised in the catholic church (I am not talking just christmas and easter here) have lower instances of drug abuse and arrest than those not raised in a religous faith. I would assume that other religions could show similar results. It seems that raising your kids to believe that whether you get caught or not, go dis always watching and you WILL someday have to answer for the things you have done can only be a positive thing.

They believe they will have to answer for the things they do eithr here on earth or when they die, and the penalty for not doing right is severe (like eternity in hell).","why-i-am-against-federalism","01:33 AM","government-debates","21"

Much like a lot of your last post. I would strongly suggest then that you not do business with the heathens.

Didn't you just say I was a little hard on the religious folks? If that's the only way you believe you can act civilly then I would prefer you keep your superstitions handy, the carrot and stick routine. I'm not sure why you mentioned Sierra Leone and Rwanda. Both those countries are very religious, Rwanda especially in its Christianity, IIRC. My contention is simple. I believe people can handle the truth, no matter where it leads. I'm not afraid to pursue it, nor am I concerned about anyone else attempting to pursue it. I believe that this society honors facts, and will marshall them in such a way as to find a path we can travel on for the benefit of the majority. If the facts and the path do not lead to some silent, mysterious god, too bad for the god. I also believe humans are better than your depiction. Just look around you, you live in Kansas for pete's sake. I also contend that anyone who harbors a belief in hell, a literal place with fire and sulpher and gnashing of teeth, with eternities of suffering for uncounted billions of people, can never be truly civilized.
