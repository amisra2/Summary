They persecute and dominate for hundreds of years, and when their tyrannical bid for power finally collapses in on itself, they cry the whine line about activist atheism, which is actually better for the nation. No matter what Christians do what what they get, they are always the downtroden, misinterpreted, ill treated receivers of global oppression. Woe is their paltry existence. Too bad the near majority of the population of America is borderline fundamentalist Christian. They are such an oppressed group! They are so oppressed! If the Christians understood American Government and the intent of the Founding fathers, they would understand the true nature of the establishment clause as not meaingly only ""separation from state church."" It's much more than that. It means religion cannot influence the government and government cannot influence the Religions or promote any one. This is clear in the arguments and opinions held by myriad founding fathers, who mostly weren't Christians in the first place. The vast majority of Atheists aren't trying to eliminate religion, they are balancing the intrinsically oppressive monolith against reason and reality.","all-you-atheists","07:17 PM","government-debates","146"
