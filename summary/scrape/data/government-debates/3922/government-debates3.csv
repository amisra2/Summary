It's directly opposite of God's teachings.","Alan Ryan","82420","But how do you know what ""God's teachings"" are in a non-religious sense ? Even the lone individual studying the Bible on his own account will have some structure to his enquiries (unless he's reading it at random ?), and this itself could be described as a one man religion.","all-you-atheists","12:25 PM","government-debates","31"

It's that ""set of opinions"" that separate God from man and is what most people refer to when they mention religion. The Bible is the most abused book in the world and that is perpetrated by religions/religionists. For example, those that hold Christianity in such an unfavorable light do so, not because they dislike or hate Christ, it's because of the religion (or set of manmade beliefs) associated with the term.","all-you-atheists","12:45 PM","government-debates","32"

"12-13-2004","3922",3,"daewoo","None","This is one of those situations where an exceptionall small minority are making life difficult for the rest fo us. Keeping in mind that over 96% answer int he affermative when asked if they believe in god, it seems that if this is really an issue, we should simply be able to ammend the first ammendment to make it mroe clear. As an alternative, we could get some supreme court judges in there that have some cahones and are willing to take difficult cases.","georged","82431","In the US those who believe in god are, depending on who's numbers you like, between 87 and 92% of the population (2002). That includes atheists who profess no belief in any god and agnostics who believe in a higher power but exclude biblical gods. Monotheists (belief in a god by Christian/Muslim/etc) are 53% of world population, followed by believers in reincarnation at 19%, ethno religions at 8%, atheists/agnostics at 14% and 6% undecided. While Christianity is touted as the world's largest belief system, once you take other numbers out of the equation it becomes clear that believing in a god and practicing religion are two entirely different subjects. The more informative numbers are in worship attendance, declining in all Christian groups for the past 50-years, attributed to a higher level of formal education less inclined to adhere to mythology as a lifestyle but retaining a belief in god from adolescent training and those estranged from the family ties once dominated by church attendance. Regular church attendance in the US is often stated as high as 40%, far higher than other Christian nations, by using 'special' holiday attendance such as easter and xmas and membership both active and inactive as published attendance numbers. Based on numbers I can accept the belief in God majority, but not specific federal legislation based on biblical mythology that eliminates states rights. Church attendance, worship, normally accepted as the mark of a true believer, just doesn't justify it. To me it looks like more of that same 'bring back the good old days' political blather and that just isn't going to happen. Our social structure has irrevocable changed to an extent that denies any ability of going back in time. Clinging to old dreams leaves little room for progress or new dreams. If anyone enjoys statistics, take a look at when Christianity is projected to decline from being the majority practiced US belief system in the US due to our social structure and continual influx of non-Christians with higher birth rates. The fastest growing religion in the US based on percentage of increase? Wiccan.","all-you-atheists","01:55 PM","government-debates","34"

The separate and equal station among the powers of the earth is an entitlement given by the laws of nature and nature's God. All men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, including but not limited to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The foundation of the government is laid upon such principles as are seen most likely to effect our safety and happiness. In its last sentence, the Declaration of Independence makes a mutual pledge with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence. The United States was never meant to be a godless country. We have a god. His name is God.","all-you-atheists","02:00 PM","government-debates","35"

One denomination claims that hell is a place where lost souls burn and are tortured forever; one teaches that it is figurative; while another refuses that the place really exists as a place. With these different opinions arise much more rules and regulations to stay out of it or at least to bypass it. This one example holds true to love, hate, political office, prayer, tithes, offerings, curse words, kissing, fornication, adultery, sex, eating and drinking, etc. The same rules, regulations, methods, and rites that God intend for us to follow, the religionists distort them into whatever agenda is deemed important for them, making the Word of God a stumbling block (1 Peter 2 : 8 ) while, simultaneously, are unaware that the Word of God is making them stumble. They use scripture to justify slavery, to substantiate racial pride, to degrade women, to gain access to public office, to promote mutual hate, etc. Even in the days when Paul preached, the Church was filled with those that confused the word of God in order to make it line up with their schema of the day. I know it sounds derogatory, and it may seem foolish to even dispute it, but man has made religion so hateful that the only way to look at it from a Christians view is the expose it for what it really is an opinion of selfish minions.","all-you-atheists","02:17 PM","government-debates","36"

"12-13-2004","3922",3,"None","None","None","Waxy","82446","I'm always struck by one thing when I read these debates - The founding fathers of the USA were brilliant. They did what I consider to be a truly astounding job of being very specific, and yet very intentionally vague at the same time. The word God, or a specific ""god"" is never mentioned that I'm aware of, instead they chose words like Creator. The care they took to express their ""Christian"" ideals without actually acknowledging or showing preference to any one specific religion in the process is nothing short of remarkable. ""Creator"" means nothing, and IMHO, this was definately NOT by accident, they could have been very specific. It could be the Christian God if you so choose to interpret it that way, but it could also be mother nature, or for that matter, whatever you choose to recognize as your creator. Whatever it means, it cannot be laid claim to as the specific property of any one religion, despite all the attempts. It's a master stroke IMHO. Waxy P.S. I guess to really get my point across I should have peppered my post with some profanity and threw in a few hateful generalizations for good measure.","all-you-atheists","03:08 PM","government-debates","39"

But a Christian view is still a religious view no matter how much you might deplore the contradictions of opinion that have been introduced by the huge variety of sub-groups (or sects). So I still can't understand why you think that ""religion has been made hateful"" and it's the Christian's duty to expose it as such.

At some point I will have accept that no matter how much I want Christianity out from under the shadow of religion - it will still be deemed as such. I will do whatever I can, however... Sorry for the confusion. It's a pet peeve of mine. BTW - I am always on the lookout for those that feel the same way - and in a roundabout way - only a few atheists understand. I made a comment once that one day science will discover that there really is a God - and from the religious corner got quite a beating for it. So, don't think I'm mainstream. I admire a couple of religious members on this site, but have yet to get approval from them. It's not that I am against organized religion of any sort, just the kind that licks the back of God's hand and slaps people with it to see if it sticks.","all-you-atheists","09:21 AM","government-debates","42"
