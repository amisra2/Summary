My pursuit of happiness includes reference to God. Our founder's pursuit of happiness included reference to God. The great majority of our population includes God in their pursuit of happiness. It's the cry baby atheists who want to have that reference taken away. Not believing in God and insisting that God be removed from government are too different things. That's like moving to a foreign country and insisting they change their language. Screw the activist atheists.","all-you-atheists","01:51 PM","government-debates","47"

Is it the belief system factor? Tradition? Desire for the 'good old days'? Childhood training? What tangible benefit or pacification is offered? Incidentally, several of our founders did not include god in their pursuit of happiness and, as I posted, far less than 40% of the population worships god on a regular, formal basis, certainly no indication of god being a factor in the majority's pursuit of happiness.","all-you-atheists","07:18 PM","government-debates","48"
"12-14-2004","3922",4,"None","None","None","Mach","82642","The use of the word god was to simply say: We bow to no man. Jefferson wanted to make it clear to England that their precious nobility and birthright held no sway over our rights, granted not by noble men, but by something outside of man...which conceptually is quite rational (concepts, for instance). And further, the ruler of our land, or rulers (3 houses), despite being in charge, STILL couldn't remove our basic freedoms, because they were granted outside the grasp of man. Makes sense. Who do we say we bow to if it's not man? Something above man. Enter ""god"". Maybe we should ammend it to define God as it was by Jefferson, and the phrase used to mention it: which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, IT WAS THE NOTION OF A DEIST GOD. Jefferson would loathe the christian coalition and religious fundamentalism. He supported science as the method of understanding the god of nature. In that respect, I have far less of an issue with the word ""god"". Is this how you interperet it? As long as it's known to be as the above, it's not in need of change IMO. ================================ Deism is defined in Webster's Encyclopedic Dictionary, 1941, as: ""[From Latin Deus, God Deity] The doctrine or creed of a Deist."" And Deist is defined in the same dictionary as: ""One who believes in the existence of a God or supreme being but denies revealed religion, basing his belief on the light of nature and reason."" http://www.nobeliefs.com/jefferson.htm http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/index.htm Although Jefferson believed in a Creator, his concept of it resembled that of the god of deism (the term ""Nature's God"" used by deists of the time). With his scientific bent, Jefferson sought to organize his thoughts on religion. He rejected the superstitions and mysticism of Christianity and even went so far as to edit the gospels, removing the miracles and mysticism of Jesus (see The Jefferson Bible) leaving only what he deemed the correct moral philosophy of Jesus. Distortions of history occur in the minds of many Christians whenever they see the word ""God"" embossed in statue or memorial concrete. For example, those who visit the Jefferson Memorial in Washington will read Jefferson's words engraved: ""I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every from of tyranny over the mind of man."" When they see the word ""God"" many Christians see this as ""proof"" of his Christianity without thinking that ""God"" can have many definitions ranging from nature to supernatural. Yet how many of them realize that this passage aimed at attacking the tyranny of the Christian clergy of Philadelphia, or that Jefferson's God was not the personal god of Christianity? Those memorial words came from a letter written to Benjamin Rush in 1800 in response to Rush's warning about the Philadelphia clergy attacking Jefferson (Jefferson was seen as an infidel by his enemies during his election for President). The complete statement reads as follows: ""The returning good sense of our country threatens abortion to their hopes, & they [the clergy] believe that any portion of power confided to me, will be exerted in opposition to their schemes. And they believe rightly; for I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man. But this is all they have to fear from me: & enough too in their opinion, & this is the cause of their printing lying pamphlets against me. . ."" -Mach","all-you-atheists","08:31 PM","government-debates","49"

First of all they couldn't allow their belief system to overtake their total and unadulterated love of country...and a new one at that. They realized that one day this country might get involved with a ONE-GOD populace that just might revert back to total church control. I can only imagine the pains that some went through by not penning in the name of Jesus Christ, but they had to just choke it down and forget about it. They had to make this nation free and to do so they had to leave out A CERTAIN GODperiod. Again, the torment some had to go through was enormous, I believe. I would like to say for the record that this is not a Christian Nation, but that it is, without doubt, a nation (almost) full of Christians. Sorry to upset the Falwellians. Endowed by our Creator is just them trying to say that only the Supreme of the Supreme could take away our rights. Hey, the truth is out there. I know another PM is coming my way, but I cant help but feel some religious beliefs are just as bad as taking away Christmas in New Jersey.

"12-15-2004","3922",4,"jim's trucking","None","The question of marriage is not simply a Christian thing. Traditionally, marriage has been between a man and a woman in all religions that I know of.

It has little to do with Christianity.","pnac=ww3","82765","Most gay marriages today (whether they are legally recognized or not) take place in Unitarian or Unitarian Universalist Churches.
