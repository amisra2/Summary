"12-18-2004","3922",7,"jim's trucking","None","""God"" was added to the Pledge in keeping with the precedence set by our founding fathers. It was added at a time when the USA was bitterly involved in struggling for freedom against a godless, powerful nation. It is intended to recognize God, not to respect any religious view. You would turn us into a godless nation just to rectify your feeling of being treated unfairly at the mention of God.","Dzeron","83344","No, ""under God"" was added during the witch hunts of the Red Scare. People wanted to invoke the aid of the State in artificially suppressing the communist ideology, not fighting for freedom. Communist ideas are not dangerous. A communist state, however, is. And so is a theocratic state. We must resist both. And it is intended to recognize theism, which is a religious view. And BTW, no one wants to force atheism on the country like you think they do. They aren't trying to put ""In No God We Trust"" on our money. Money is money - it doesn't need religious chants on it in order to be money.","all-you-atheists","02:30 PM","government-debates","92"

Heck, the last election made it clear that most people like a president to be religious. Affirmation that religion exists and and it's influences on this nation are not malevolent things. No one is harmed with the words ""In God we Trust"" on a coin. Is it really worth all the hoopla and even going against the views of most of America to wage this witch hunt on all religious references and mentionings in this country? It's not like a particular state religion is being mandated here--the money and the pledge don't even specifically point to any given religion. And if atheism indeed isn't a religion-like ideology as atheists claim it isn't, then why would they be so offended?","all-you-atheists","07:17 PM","government-debates","94"

Where does the government get its money? Taxes. So atheists are getting taxed to pay for theist promotions.

A tax on God is something few politicians other than those with suicidal urges would consider. Too many Christians out there and you can't mess with belief systems when seeking votes.","all-you-atheists","08:17 PM","government-debates","96"

And are you suggesting that those who drive on interstates should pay higher taxes than those who take the highways? (Interstates are more traveled, and therefore cost more to maintain.) Some of your taxes may even go toward a presidential candidate's campaign who's ideas you might despise. (Many candidates take federal funding for some of their campaign costs.) The idea of having people pay higher taxes for certain services is rife with potential problems.","all-you-atheists","10:24 PM","government-debates","97"

To say: It is an effort to make America a godless country when IT NEVER WAS INTENDED TO BE DETACHED FROM GOD. is an error. This country never was attached to any god. Our consitution, the foundation of our government, is secular, intentional, and for good reason. You know you cannot deny that, yet I see you denying it, why? You must mean it's an effort to: Keep the consititution and our government from beng attached TO a christian flavored ficticious diety and thus put the religious nuts in power over the people..and over what's right and wrong. Yes, that I agree with. I think the constitution should remain as it is, and the pledge should be put back like it was, and a government building, in addition to any legal rulings, should not respect any establishment of religion. For good reasons, not just because. -Mach","all-you-atheists","12:39 AM","government-debates","99"

They already don't pay taxes on their cash cow tax collection superplexes (churches), why would you think they'd have to pay taxes for promoting their brand of ignorance in public buildings?

C'mon!), it really is worth the ""hoopla"" if only to keep religionists from approaching, let alone scaling, the wall, IMO. After all, do you somehow believe this is all they wish for? No further demands will be made if only our coins are left alone? Plus, I think your statement that the generic ""God"" is not referring to the Christian god is disingenuous. I have no way to prove it but I suspect you, like the other 85% of the population, have Yahweh in mind.","all-you-atheists","09:32 AM","government-debates","101"
