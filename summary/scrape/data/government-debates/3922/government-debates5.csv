"12-15-2004","3922",5,"jim's trucking","None","I've already mentioned life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. My pursuit of happiness includes reference to God. Our founder's pursuit of happiness included reference to God. The great majority of our population includes God in their pursuit of happiness. It's the cry baby atheists who want to have that reference taken away. Not believing in God and insisting that God be removed from government are too different things. That's like moving to a foreign country and insisting they change their language. Screw the activist atheists.","Dzeron","82875","Who are these activist atheists? What do they want? I can see good reason in removing references to God on our currency and our pledge, which is what the atheist activists want. I have heard, however, of some atheist activists who want to make it illegal for legislators to make decisions based on religion. That is what I disagree with. If a legislator votes for a theocratic law, the law itself must be attacked, not the legislator's motives. We can't change the motives of legislators. A legislator can pass an anti-murder law based on the most absurd divinations, but that doesn't change the fact that an anti-murder law is good.","all-you-atheists","09:44 PM","government-debates","61"
"12-15-2004","3922",5,"Big Orn","None","In order to understand it better, most people (including the religious folks) need to understand the very thin ice these founders were treading on. First of all they couldn't allow their belief system to overtake their total and unadulterated love of country...and a new one at that. They realized that one day this country might get involved with a ONE-GOD populace that just might revert back to total church control. I can only imagine the pains that some went through by not penning in the name of Jesus Christ, but they had to just choke it down and forget about it. They had to make this nation free and to do so they had to leave out A CERTAIN GODperiod. Again, the torment some had to go through was enormous, I believe. I would like to say for the record that this is not a Christian Nation, but that it is, without doubt, a nation (almost) full of Christians. Sorry to upset the Falwellians. Endowed by our Creator is just them trying to say that only the Supreme of the Supreme could take away our rights. Hey, the truth is out there. I know another PM is coming my way, but I cant help but feel some religious beliefs are just as bad as taking away Christmas in New Jersey. What a bunch of Scroogeian Grinches.","Mach","82890","But I disagree, politely with Big Orn I think the literal words used ""Laws of Nature and Nature's God"" is very specific as the god of the author, a deist. Jefferson thought of Jesus Christ as an important philosopher, not as divinity, I don't think he was itching to jot his name down. The Declaration of Independance isn't a legal document, it's not what our constitution is based on, it's not what our government is based on. It served a purpose, to declare our indpendance from english nobility (and everyone else for that matter), that is all. I agree in that it was important to make sure we defined our rights as being granted by ""no human"", and thus no human could take them away. I don't think there was a more eloquent way, at that time, to do so. The consititution, notably, does not contiain the word ""god"" for a reason. It's a secular government, by intent, and by design. The beauty of our freedom is that you're free to have faith and go to church, and no one is able to prevent that. To FORCE religion, would be less free, thus, we have the most free government we could concieve with respect to religion, or lack of religion for that matter. How great is that? -Mach","all-you-atheists","11:44 PM","government-debates","62"
"12-15-2004","3922",5,"billsco","None","It should sadden us that we could elect a non-Christian such as Jefferson 200 years ago and not be able to today. Who has been the activist in this country, Christian or non-, for that to be the reality? Screw the activist Christians!","Mach","82891","That is truly a sore spot with me, being treated as a second-class citizen. Actually, atheists are legally restricted from certain public offices, but I think they would be ruled unconstitutonal if there was ever a need to use them. I suppose we are all judged on one thing or another. With regards to Jefferson in particular, it really should sadden us, we went from having great thinkers steering our country to Bush. It's scary, I don't know what it means, but I can't imagine how it can be a good thing. It's the age-old battle of sophistry vs logic. Both are compelling, but sophistry is easier... -Mach","all-you-atheists","11:54 PM","government-debates","63"
"12-16-2004","3922",5,"jim's trucking","None","Trying to keep someone from running my life is not judging them. I care not that the atheists do not believe in God. I care not how many or what kind of gods you believe in. All I care about is being left to my own devices when it comes to spiritual things.","lucky_me","82940","so wouldnt that boil down to if you leave them alone they will leave you alone? and you shouldnt use such big words...they dont make you sound any smarter and a lot of people can get their point across in words that most people know and understand","all-you-atheists","11:07 AM","government-debates","64"

I'm not asking for an amendment. I'm asking the activist atheists to stop misinterpreting the intent of our founding fathers and attempting to force this nation to live according to their standards. There's no need to amend the Constitution regarding this. I'm not out to change the atheists into believers. I'm not a Bible thumper. I could not care less whether you or anybody else believes in God, Allah, mutton chops or mullets. Just don't try to affect my beliefs or curtail this country's ORIGINAL RECOGNITION OF GOD.","all-you-atheists","01:56 PM","government-debates","70"

Your example is not only inadequate, it stinks of judgmentalism. There is no comparable example of fighting for constitutional rights involved with the God thing. Had our Constitution said that blacks do not have the same rights as others, then you might have a point...I probably would object to blacks fighting for their rights. But it didn't and I don't.

That's when ""under God"" was added to the Pledge of Allegiance. I believe it was Eisenhower trying to give the finger to the Russians at the beginning of the Cold War...sort of like a squaring off between a godless nation and a Godly nation. This nation was always intended to be Godly. It did not change the wording of the Declaration of Independence and there was no amendment to the Constitution. I'm not aware that anything unconstitutional happened regarding references to God. If you don't want to recognize God, that's fine with me. Just don't come here and demand that all recognition be removed. Move to Russia.","all-you-atheists","02:14 PM","government-debates","73"
