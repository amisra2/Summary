Well, anyway, no one addressed that fact that The Constitution of the United States of America begins with the phrase ""We the people..."" of course and ends with: "" Done in Convention by the Unanimous Consent of the States present the Seventeenth Day of September in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and Eighty seven and of the Independence of the United States of America the Twelfth. In Witness whereof We have hereunto subscribed our Names. "" So the year it was ratified was 1787 years after the birth of ""we the people's"" lord. It is saying in the constitution that the lord of us the people was born 1787 years before the ratification of our constitution. There is one lard I can think of that fits that description (and he is the people's lord.) btw- I didn't realize that there were 11 previous United States of America.","all-you-atheists","10:30 PM","government-debates","121"

It would have seemed very odd if they had referred to some obscure calendar that nobody knew about. They had to have the date on the thing, you know. Reference to the calendar should not override the First Amendment, anyway. Furthermore, A.D. years are not exactly the amount of years since the birth of Jesus. It's a few years off, which is one of the reasons why people are starting to call it C.E. (Common Era.)","all-you-atheists","11:24 PM","government-debates","122"

No it does not override the first ammendment. But, does the wording imply that We the people have a specific lord. They didn't have to use the phrase ""year of our lord"" at all, nor ""anno domini"" which is the same. They could have just said, in the year 1787, but they didn't. Such a document as the constitution has VERY deliberate wording. Was there a purpose to saying ""year of our lord"" or did they overlook future conflict over religion in the government?","all-you-atheists","12:49 AM","government-debates","123"

Actually at this point they thought they would probably be hanged for treason at the time of writing this letter. They were starting a war with the most powerful nation at the time. This was a letter from a group of people to another person (the King). It holds no legal standing whatsoever. On the calender part, if I put october as the date, would people in the future assume it was the 8th because oct means 8? They would probably accept that it is a month on the calendar in my time period.","all-you-atheists","11:25 PM","government-debates","124"
"01-01-2005","3922",9,"pnac=ww3","None","The pledge it just like a song. A song that little kids are forced to sing in the morning in school. Well, maybe not so much anymore. The pledge isn't sacred or anything. Who cares what it says at all?","zachvac","84619","wait, not so much anymore? I assume you're not a kid or you don't have kids in public school? It's mandatory for public schools to at least give kids the option to recite the pledge. Some places people are punished for not reciting the pledge and in many more places they are punished for not standing. In my school it still stand that we can be sent to the principal's office for not standing for the pledge though it is rarely enforced. But it is government-sanctioned, and some people are forced to recite it. What if we changed it to I pledge to ""one nation, where we know god is just a substitute for thought, ..."" now that would cause an uproar","all-you-atheists","11:32 PM","government-debates","125"
"01-01-2005","3922",9,"jyoshu","None","I'm sure some of your tax dollars go to build or fix roads you may never drive on in your whole life. And are you suggesting that those who drive on interstates should pay higher taxes than those who take the highways? (Interstates are more traveled, and therefore cost more to maintain.) Some of your taxes may even go toward a presidential candidate's campaign who's ideas you might despise. (Many candidates take federal funding for some of their campaign costs.) The idea of having people pay higher taxes for certain services is rife with potential problems.","zachvac","84620","As to roads, yes I agree with what you say, that's why we have tolls. To the presidential candidates, all parties that recieve public funding recieve the same amount, there aren't the same amount of bills with in god we trust as there are with in no god we trust. For those of you who say ""in god we trust"" is no big deal on money, you wouldn't mind putting ""god doesn't exist"" on money, right? It's just money.","all-you-atheists","11:38 PM","government-debates","126"

The freaking date is irrelevant, let the holy rollers have their date, we get the entire document to be secular and to seperate church and state. The real error here is that fundies simply can't comprehend much, and of course that includes the fact that a democracy that is secular is better for freedom (including religious freedom) than a theocracy.

Of course they wanted it to look good, and the reason they saved it could have been for others in England to study. I think they were thinking they would be the Rosa Parks of the English colonists' rights movement. They wanted to make a statement to the King and all the citizens of England on what was really happening. Now the Constitution was written for the United States since it happens to be the Supreme law. If it's in the Constitution it supercedes everything else, and they never mentioned God there.","all-you-atheists","01:10 PM","government-debates","130"
"01-09-2005","3922",9,"jim's trucking","None","It hasn't been proven yet...it's just what I believe. I believe God intends for man to enjoy freedoms and individuality. Besides, what I said was that the ""nation was founded in the principles of Godliness."" Freedom and individuality are only two priniciples among the many that formed the basic structure of our resolve. Fairness (justice) and a drive toward pleasant living standards (promotion of the common good) seem Godly principles also.","bonddm","85657","If God wanted us to be individuals why must we ALL conform to one book of guidelines for life???","all-you-atheists","02:58 PM","government-debates","131"

What do religious institutions sell? Souls? What do they teach..ignorance? They are like the anti-hospital and anti-university. They don't benefit everyone, and most don't, by definition, treat everyone equally. These are required of most non-profits. Some churches adhere to code. Others don't. Further, the latest church involvement in politics is grounds enough for such churches to be required to pay taxes. But where is the outcry? Why are churches, in many cases just a revenue stream for the founders/board, not taxed? -Mach","all-you-atheists","08:58 PM","government-debates","134"
