"12-21-2004","3922",8,"jim's trucking","None","I suppose the next major drive by the activist atheists and their army of ACLU shysters could be to forbid Christmas Parades all over the country. After all, they use the public streets, they usually require police officers (paid with public funds) and they've often got Santa riding on a firetruck (owned by the local citizens) or the firetrucks will just be in the parade along with the Public (government) School Bands. My God! We can't have those pitiful atheists being offended! Let's do away with Easter Parades, too.","Dzeron","83482","A private-funded Christmas parade is fine, but a publically funded one? I wasn't even aware that these things were going on. Atheists deserve a real tax break!","all-you-atheists","02:10 PM","government-debates","106"
"12-21-2004","3922",8,"Waxy","None","I don't hear any atheists whining and crying around here, that's only coming from one side. Boo Hoo, I don't like change. Boo Hoo, it was my country first. Boo Hoo, why don't you love God? Boo Hoo, why are all those mean and nasty atheists picking on me? It's kinda pitiful. Almost as pitiful as when they adopt the tough guy stance. Waxy P.S. Screw 'em I say.","jim's trucking","83494","Who's crying? Not I. I'm just putting people on notice. Your animations are indicative of your inability to come up with a clear concise argument. You resort to false mimicry. Nothing in this thread points to a general dislike of change on my part. It's not MY country. It is a country founded by Godly men with a clear recognition of our Creator and Lord. Read this and any other posts of mine and you will not find where I give a rat's XXX whether you love God. That is your business. I don't where anyone has characterized the atheists as mean and nasty. I don't recall complaining of being picked on. I simply put out a statement.. Not nearly as pitiful as your attempt to make some profound statement.","all-you-atheists","03:02 PM","government-debates","107"

I wasn't trying to be profound that's for sure, apparently, you didn't see the humour either. I'm just really amused at how you've got your knickers in a bunch over the #%$# !@#$@ atheists that are coming to ""ruin"" everything you cherish. The funniest thing, well there's two actually, one, you don't really have a leg to stand on legally despite your claims to the contrary, and two, the threat is mostly in your head. Boo Hoo.

I'm equally if not more amused at how people tend to think someone has their panties in a bunch just because they make a statement. I'm not easily upset. If you could just see my face... Superlatives will get you in trouble every time. There can't be two funniest things. One, I'm not pressing for a legal interpretation. I'm merely stating my opinion and experimenting with reactions to it. Who knows, one day I may change my mind. The Supreme Court will eventually get to it. Its decision may not the correct one, but it will be THE one for a while. Two, I don't see the atheist saber rattling as a threat. I see it as temper tantrums by crybaby adolescents who have their feelings hurt every time God is mentioned. Of, I'm sorry I've moved you to tears, but the truth usually hurts.","all-you-atheists","03:42 PM","government-debates","109"

If you'll notice the Smilies available in the forum include the ""censored"" red face. I wrote the post first as a word.doc complete with expletives. I copied it to the posting pallet and changed the expletives to the ""censored"" icon. THEN, I posted the thread. There was no afterthought cleanup. I cleaned it up before posting because this is a censored forum (and I appreciate that). If you want to see the original you'll need to go to an uncensored forum such as: http://www.politicalforums.net So far you have merely quoted some text with expletives. You have not substantiated your claim of whining and crying. All you have done is boast of your own self-adjudged refinement and displayed some snobbery.

I didn't state that YOU were crying and whining, I said that the whing and crying seems to be coming from the ""pro God"" side. Nor did I set out to prove that you were crying and whining. For someone that treasures exact representations of debates such as yourself, and has such a fondness for expressing that talent, I thought you'd pick up on that. Or did you pick up on it and just choose to ignore it? You used the term ""crybaby adolescent"". I guess we can disagree on exactly what type of behaviour would fall into that classification, but IMO, childish statements and expletives such as those that I quoted are pretty good examples. If believing that resorting to statements like that and expletives has no place in a formal discussion or on a board such as this makes one a snob, then, yes, I'm a snob. I think it's a pretty clear reflection on the poster. Anyhoo, it's been fun, it's certainly helped me kill the excruciating final hours in the office before I get to go on holidays for 2 weeks. I'm outta here for the holidays at noon. In all honesty, I hope you and your family have a very enjoyable and safe Christmas and New Years.
