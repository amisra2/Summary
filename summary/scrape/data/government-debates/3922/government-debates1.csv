The Preamble to the Constitution of the United States should clue you in on the intent of this nation of people. Analyze it word by word and you may be astounded to conclude that you have been absolutely idiotic in your relentless quest to have God removed from the government of the people. Acknowledgement of our Creator being prohibited in government is anti-American for the simple reason that this existing nation was founded in the principles of Godliness. We, the people of the United States are a nation of people bound together by our liberty to generally do as we please without interference or control by a national church. We have all churches known to man. We worship when, where and how we please within the constraints of common decency and law. It was a revolt against the church, not against God, that led our leaders, in order to form a more perfect Union to establish a nation free of church rule and church justice. The use of the word union implies a bond among the people. Its capitalization implies the importance of recognizing it as the basis of our country. To establish justice meant to separate the human frailties of church leaders and religious dogma from the government (and taxation) of the people. To insure domestic tranquility is no easy task especially when one has difficulty defining tranquility in other than relative terms. To guarantee our peace and provide for the common defense , a nation must maintain superior military forces compared to other nations. We intend to stay strong and capable of defeating any and all attacks on our Union. To promote the general welfare our government provides expenditure of funds for infrastructure and other needs common to the people of the Union. Just stop and think of all the government giveaway programs that we have leaching off the national treasury. To secure ourselves and the blessings of liberty that we enjoy as members of this Union requires law and military. Unfortunately for some, these bring the need for lawyers, law enforcement, trained and ready militia (minutemen) and a whole passel of superior weapons, technology and knowledge of our many enemies. If we stop and think to ourselves , though there is no joy in the killing of innocents, the defense of our Union against whatever challenges are met, must be a fight to the death. There is no joy in terrorists attacks, the sole intents of which are to disturb the relative domestic tranquility. To recognize the enemies, we must identify ourselves and our posterity . Since we expect the government to protect us from any and all comers, we must give the government a lot of personal information. Its not any more personal than name, address, serial numbers, pin numbers, social security numbers, drivers license numbers, vehicle registration numbers, bank account numbers, recent photos, fingerprints, urine samples, blood samples, DNA samples, FBI files, court records, dental records, purchase records, surveillance videos, phone taps, interviews with neighbors and family members and such. The Who Why and What of the Preamble is completed with the action taken by us, the people of the United States. What did we do ? It was to ordain our Constitution. To ordain means to invest officially (as by the laying on of hands) with ministerial or priestly authority. It implies the recognition of God and beseeches His blessing on the Union. We ordained the effort and then proceeded to write in our own language and establish the Constitution of the United States of America. God bless America!!! Communism!!!

But...check your local dictionary for the definitions of ordain. If ordain was meant totally as you say, then there would be no need for and establish . Knowing how carefully our founding documents are put together and that confusing duplicity is not intended, one can conclude that ordain is used here with intent of implying its number one or preferred definition.","all-you-atheists","05:28 PM","government-debates","3"

I believe God intends for man to enjoy freedoms and individuality. Besides, what I said was that the ""nation was founded in the principles of Godliness."" Freedom and individuality are only two priniciples among the many that formed the basic structure of our resolve. Fairness (justice) and a drive toward pleasant living standards (promotion of the common good) seem Godly principles also.","all-you-atheists","12:18 PM","government-debates","13"

You will note that the message is addressed to all atheists, but the kiss-off is addressed to activists. A quiet, unassuming atheist is a good atheist.
