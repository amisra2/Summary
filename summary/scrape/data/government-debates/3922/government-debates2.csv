"12-12-2004","3922",2,"jim's trucking","None","You're absolutely right about that. The Bible Thumpers (BT) are as obnoxious as anyone can be. They spend a lot of time telling people what they should believe. However, there's a difference between what they do and what the activist atheists are doing. Based on religious freedom and freedom speech, the BTs are proselytizing for their church. There's no requirement to respond. With the activists atheist's drive, the response is to be mandated.","georged","82334","Any gay desiring to be married in many states would quickly put big holes in that statement. I could use your own arguments against same-sex marriage, drugs and ethnic discrimination, as dictated by BT belief system, to show how influential the Christian bible is in mandating social and moral legislation. Let's hear it for hypocrisy?","all-you-atheists","02:24 PM","government-debates","18"

Was ""censorship"" common in the past, as far as foul language on television and radio? Yes. Athiest activists want mandatory CHANGE to these things - compliance from everyone. Most Christian activists seek to maintain public tradition, without interfering with private freedoms. In Athiests quest to ""get rid of"" certain things, there is more of a ""requirement to respond"" to them than there is to those who only seek to maintain tradition.","all-you-atheists","07:00 AM","government-debates","21"

That's stretching your statement a bit. Hopefully our Supreme Court hasn't deteriorated to the point of amending our constitution to legalize a Christian goal to retain 'tradition' based on biblical mythology while eliminating a states right. That would put us on a plane with Muslim countries, where belief system Islamic Law can supersede civil and criminal law, destroying our states rights, our claimed status as a republic and the separation of government and church in a democracy.","all-you-atheists","10:01 AM","government-debates","22"

Traditionally, marriage has been between a man and a woman in all religions that I know of. (Some have allowed multiple wives, but it's always been a MAN marrying a WOMAN.) It has little to do with Christianity. It does have something to do with recognition of God. This is the problem that atheists have with life...everybody else keeps mentioning and worshipping God. In order to keep from offending the atheists, we should all cease and desist? God was part of the founding movement of this country and should remain part of the ongoing effort to survive. God has a place in our government...religion does not!","all-you-atheists","10:21 AM","government-debates","23"

I know that mention of God appears a lot in the Declaration of Independence and the religious beliefs of some of the founding fathers were of course thoroughly Christian (or at least Deist) - but I'm not sure how you draw from that fact an ""ought"" that it should remain that way or what survival has to do with the case ? I'm also puzzled by your assertion that God has a place (in government) but ""religion"" is somehow a separate issue: what kind of God do you envisage here ?","all-you-atheists","10:57 AM","government-debates","26"

Freedom of religion and separation of religion from government, as defined by our founding fathers, means just that. When you bring biblical mythology (the Christian bible) into the picture, such as marriage being between only a man and a woman, you've put religious dogma in the place of a god. That's no different than the English during that period ruling that a certain religion (in this case that sect of Christianity) must be followed or suffer the consequences from religiously defined legislation.","all-you-atheists","11:12 AM","government-debates","27"

This is something that over 80% of the country opposes, not just the religous right. Granted the religous right latches on to these issues and declares themselves the protectors of the American peoples moral sensibilities, but this seems to be more of a publicity issue than a practical one. I think the real issue is that people see that our nation is in serious decline, even if they do not wish to acknowledge it. They are trying to ""fix"" what they see as the problem. Which side is right? I think neither. Our nation will not be saved by a return to religous based principals. Completley barring religoun is not likely to be effective either. For a LOT of years people got along just fine with MORE religoun in government than there is now, and your token athiest just closed their eyes to it or didn't participate. Everybody was fine with this. The problem seems to be the arrival of these fanatcis on the scene. It is never good to have fanatics running around, regardless of what it is they are fanatical about. This is one of those situations where an exceptionall small minority are making life difficult for the rest fo us. Keeping in mind that over 96% answer int he affermative when asked if they believe in god, it seems that if this is really an issue, we should simply be able to ammend the first ammendment to make it mroe clear. As an alternative, we could get some supreme court judges in there that have some cahones and are willing to take difficult cases. Froma realistic standpoint, we have no seperation of church and state in this country, nor did those who wrote our constitution expect for us to. The seperation of church and state that they spoke of in ammendment one was primarily a concern because as good british subjects, these guys were all required by law to be memebrs of the church of england. TO A MAN the founders advocated the use of the bible as a text book. While they were not all christians (most were diests), they were all ""god fearing"" men. This issue is just like our current second ammendment issues. Traditionally, the supreme court has relied heavily on original intent when interpeting the constitution. Our fonders were prone to writing long (and sometimes boring) narratives regarding their views and how they came to adopt the principals they included in the constitution. There is no doubt as to what they meant when drafting the second ammendment, and there is no doubt as to what they meant when drafting the first ammendment. Those who would claim that the constitution protects them from having to hear the word ""god"" in the pledge, or see a copy of the ten commandments in a courthouse are simply wrong. It provides no such protectiong. Those who would claim that the second ammendmnet allows for background checks and permit systems in relation to firearms are also wrong. It clearly permits no such restrictions. It has been a lot of years since we had a supreme court that was willing to take such politically charged cases. I think maybe this is because we lack judges who show any integrity at all.","all-you-atheists","11:48 AM","government-debates","28"

Religion has become a crutch to those in power to influence the masses. It's directly opposite of God's teachings.
