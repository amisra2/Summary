You would probably agree that raising objections to those additions at that time would have been dangerous.","jim's trucking","83009","No. The precedence was set in the Declaration of Independence. There is nothing wrong with recognizing God on public property. It's when you demand that someone worship God (or anything else) that you are unconstitutional. There's a difference between recognition and promotion. I doubt danger at the time had much to do with it. It was more dangerous to try to break from the king than to offend the peers.","all-you-atheists","02:35 PM","government-debates","76"

How would you change that?","jim's trucking","83011","No, what you did was comment that I was trying for an amendment or government forces against the activist atheists. I'm doing neither.

If we consider all of Jefferon's writings to be legal precedence, you're in for some trouble. What are you basing this off of? The constitution is secular. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. A government funded (public or government building) ""respecting"" a specific religion or religions, is not constitutional. What are we missing here? I agree, ""god"" should never be removed from the declaration of independance, that would be dumb. However, God was ADDED to the pledge of allegiance. It ORIGINALLY did not have ""under gawd"" in it. So I agree with you, we should take the words ""under god"" out of the pledge, since it obviously was not the original intent to have those words in the pledge. Further, it respects religion, and is not constitutional. -Mach","all-you-atheists","10:36 AM","government-debates","83"
"12-17-2004","3922",6,"None","None","None","Waxy","83144","I really think Mach nailed this one. IMHO, the one true goal of the founding fathers was to ensure that power could in no way be interpreted to come from a ""human"" source. The concept of a person's rights being inalienable, ie not granted by any physical being, is the ultimate protection of those rights. At the same time, as I said previously, they were very careful not to tie the source of those rights to any specific god or religion, thus the use of the word ""Creator"". There's no doubt that the documents are Deist in nature, they directly attribute our rights to a higher power, but all this arguing about exactly who or what the founding fathers believed in is completely pointless IMHO, the fact is, there is no right answer, and that's not by accident. The addition of ""God"" in the 1950's in no way impacts what was originally written IMHO. It can be written out just as easily as it was written in. When it comes right down to it, I don't think the ""pro-God"" side really has a leg to stand on other than ""it's always been that way"". The founding fathers made sure of that, regardless of their personal beliefs. That being said, I'll never understand the fervent desire to remove all traces of ""God"" from public documents and buildings, it seems like a colossal waste of time and money to me.

Well, maybe not so much anymore. They took some guy's song and added words to it. Like Puff Daddy covering the Police. The pledge isn't sacred or anything. Who cares what it says at all?

If you don't care, why worry about if it's returned to it's original wording? It was changed to tie atheism to a pereceived evil, why should it not be unchanged as one token of repairing that stigma? Or perhaps you are suggesting that if some people care, they should be like you, and not care, else, they are wrong? Perhaps you mean that the many anti-atheistic fragments strewn about in our society should just stay there, because, after all, Christians put them there? Who cares if the neocons take us to war? We're all going to die anyway, why not go out guns blazing? Things matter to me, and I suspect, to you too. -Mach","all-you-atheists","12:03 PM","government-debates","86"

Though the DOI is not a legal document in the strictist sense, it is the precedent setting formulation of thought behind the founding of the nation. It was attested to by all signators and sent to the King as a declaration (we officially declare our separation from your legal system based on the aformentioned) of our instantaneous legal independence. In that sense, it is a legal document and should be considered when making an effort to determine the intent of the wording of the Constitution. We don't. Displaying the word""God"", or the Ten Commandments, or the Bible, or the Dead Sea Scrolls, or the Declaration of Independence, or the Torah, or the Nativity Scene, or a prayer rug, or the Star of David, or a Crucifix, or Rosary beads or any other artifact or symbol of religious thought IS NOT MAKING A LAW RESPECTING RELIGION. No law has been made. No force has been applied. No requirement to view, bow in front of, touch or otherwise revere the display has been made. You are free to walk right on by as if it were not there. You can ignore the display in the same manner that you ignore God. I don't care. But don't come up to the podium and tell me all this has to go because it offends your atheist XXX. ""God"" was added to the Pledge in keeping with the precedence set by our founding fathers. It was added at a time when the USA was bitterly involved in struggling for freedom against a godless, powerful nation. It is intended to recognize God, not to respect any religious view. You would turn us into a godless nation just to rectify your feeling of being treated unfairly at the mention of God.","all-you-atheists","12:36 PM","government-debates","87"

There is no law that causes some legal papers to use the phrase ""in the year of our Lord..."" The same argument used to attempt removal of ""Under God"" from the pledge can be made for all other mentions of God. It is an effort to make America a godless country when IT NEVER WAS INTENDED TO BE DETACHED FROM GOD. It is similar to the silly uproar over the Confederate Flag. Oh, my God! It offends these few people...we must have it removed from sight.","all-you-atheists","01:54 PM","government-debates","90"
