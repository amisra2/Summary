It's perfectly applicable to today. I was making a parrallel to the current media's views on the war in Iraq, the views of Americans at home, and how we are perceived by the people in the country (at least according to the media). A follow-up to this would be evidence of how successful Europe was (economically) following reconstruction, how democratic governments were established, and how easily Europeans forget. Another correlary to this would be finding pro-Nazi propaganda from the US and Europe and comparing it to modern terrorist sympathizers. From anti-semitism to appeasement and isolationism, the modern anti-war crowd has surely taken its lessons from history.","comments-war","01:00 PM","government-debates","3"

Trolling might have been the wrong term. Dishonest and baiting would perhaps be more suitable. That`s fine. But at least explain why you think there is a parallel and that this is the topic of debate in this partidcular thread. You plan on dishing out something in the line with the marshal help again? Boy, that is going to cost you. And this time, there are no obvious economic or political benefits for doing so... You mean re-established. This was Europe. Not Japan. Forget what? That seems weird. Is there any such parallel? Hmmm... I can think of a few times when appeasment has wroked wonders and I can think of a few time when anti-war crowds have kept nations from going to war. History is full of events and learning from it is certainly an art.... Anti-semitism is on the other hand always ugly. Just like xeno-phobia, islamo-phobia and anti-muslimism (if there is such a word).","comments-war","01:14 PM","government-debates","4"

Or who was by far the largest beneficiary? Or is this one of your apples to oranges comparisons in an attempt to justify our actions in Iraq?","comments-war","01:28 PM","government-debates","5"

The first impact I intended was that people would react to the words, not try to put them in a seperate context. The parallel is inherent in the comments themselves. Do I really need to provide links to CNN and the BBC to show that journalists oppose American efforts in Iraq? No obvious economic or political benefits? How about a democratic nation in the middle east, ruled by neither theocrats nor despots? I suppose if you want to get technical, Hitler's regime was democratic. However, following WWI, Germany went through a history of revolutions and counter revolutions, never really stabilizing until a heavy handed dictator came into power. Italy was likewise ruled by a dictator, again thanks to post-WWI turmoil. The fact that freedom sometimes comes with a price. And the brutality of living under a dictator. And having an insane dictator who kills those near him to protect himself. Maybe they have different perspectives (i.e. modern terrorist sympathisers think Hitler was a horrible person), but that doesn't change the fact that they are supporting a philosophy that devalues human life and seeks to take over the world and kill jews. [QUOTE=Eddie]Hmmm... I can think of a few times when appeasment has wroked wonders and I can think of a few time when anti-war crowds have kept nations from going to war. History is full of events and learning from it is certainly an art.... Very true, but there have also been times when war has been beneficial in the long run. The anti-war crowd wasn't going to stop concentration camp, and they weren't going to liberate France. I agree. Which is why we should take a hard stance against people who want to ""drive Isreal into the sea"" and those who support the indiscriminate taking of human life.","comments-war","01:38 PM","government-debates","6"
