I will appoint my own 5 Here is another major problem, I don't know if Congress will approve of my nominees. The question is, if there's no one left in Congress, can they become judges? I just call a meeting in the middle of the forest and ""accidentally"" drop my cigarette on the ground and start a forest fire. The vote would be 0-0 in which case my VP would break the tie in the Senate, not sure about the house 4. they will rule that the Constitution is unconstitutional and (we haven't decided yet) either say there are no laws (but we would have all the weapons) or else say that the Constitution really means I am supreme dictator. Sound good? P.S. I am offering protection for the low price of $1,000. Get it while it lasts, when I become president it goes up.","lets-overthrow-government","09:35 PM","government-debates","1"

If he's already annoyed enough to consider shooting up his school, isn't it likely that getting arrested for a thought crime is likely to make things worse? I find it bizarre that you support allowing hate speech but want to police the musings of teenagers.","lets-overthrow-government","04:33 PM","government-debates","11"

Like if he stepped off his parent's property carrying, or if he was making a direct threat (like ""I'm going to XXXX up this school"", or ""I'm going to kill these people""). As pointed out before, direct threats are not part of free speech and are an arrestable offense.","lets-overthrow-government","08:28 AM","government-debates","14"

Besides the fact that a lot of people might not be terribly amused by it, it's begging for attention from all the wrong people. And please steer clear of the neutron bombs. I suspect that the detonation would likely kill my fiancee who works downtown in DC and possibly myself, on the Virginia side of the Potomac.
