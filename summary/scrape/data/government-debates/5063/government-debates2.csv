Besides that, why don't we just put telescreens in everyones' houses so we can tell if they will kill anyone. Again, ""they who would sacrifice freedom for security deserve neither"".","lets-overthrow-government","11:15 PM","government-debates","17"

Do you really call a plan that starts with ""get elected president"" a threat?","lets-overthrow-government","11:19 PM","government-debates","18"

Well, let me tell ya, THIS IS THE BEST IT GETS MY FRIEND. We may be one of the most corrupt countries in the world, besides China, but we are also the most advanced, the most complete, the most secure, etc. You may think anarchy is the perfect gov., it isnt. Think about it...if we had total anarchy, that is, chaos right? Anarchy in itself is an oxymoron, because if we had anarchy, someone would think ""oh, im the strongest in the country im gonna take over"" BOOM Dictatorship, or another government, whatever kind of person he/she is, and other countrys would see us a easy pickins. Theyd go back to the old imperialism days were they just take over countries. We would be Chinas bitch in a day.","lets-overthrow-government","12:46 AM","government-debates","20"

But as long as we're talking fantasy... If I really overthrew the government I would not leave it in complete anarchy, I would take control. By the way your post is kind of funny because you say that this is the best that it gets then go on to say this is the most corrupt country besides China. So if we cut down on corruption it would naturally get better, would it not?","lets-overthrow-government","10:42 PM","government-debates","21"

Them not following my orders would be called treason. And I would not be a dictator (well I sort of would be), I would be the president under the Constitution. The Constitution would just give the president way more power and an unlimited term in office. You think our allies would do something about a process within the government? If England decided to ammend their Constitution would we attack them and make them change it back? Have any of our allies ever attacked us for passing the Patriot Act which is basically a free pass for the president to arrest someone. If you disagree with me you are just labelled a terrorist and carted off indefinately without hearing the crimes against you. Why would the allies act against me if all I was doing was fighting terrorism?","lets-overthrow-government","10:52 PM","government-debates","25"

You are entitled to your opinion and I am pleased that someone so young, uneducated (based on this post) and inexperienced is interested in serious subjects. Following generations are always left to reap the fruits and bear the mistakes of their predecessors. Your generation will have a mountain to climb, and you as an individual must decide wither to (1)lead, (2)follow, or (3)get out of the way. To lead you must endlessly educate yourself, keep an open mind, and learn to present your views properly. To follow you must select your path carefully and not be part of a herd guided by emotion. To get out of the way, you can sit back safely with crude, negative posts pointing fingers and calling names. Consider your choice carefully.

That you and others on this forum are unafraid of speaking out against what are blatant injustices my generation has and is burdening you with is refreshing. Most Americans look only at their present circumstances with no regard to the future, blindly following the direction furnished by self-serving politicians and those in power who facilitate their elections. And you do not have a rosy future. We're burdening you with frightening debt to maintain an illusion of economic prosperity, perpetuating attacks on our nation by our special interest self-serving policies and diminishing your quality of education.

Then you can get the FBI to investigate all of your political opponents, have the IRS investigate them, and get them imprisoned for tax evasion. Really, there's a lot of ways to circumvent the normal limits of power, Clinton, JFK, and FDR did most of them.
