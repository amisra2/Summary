Therefore you should not be able to vote. Most recently you've harped on about seizing rights to carry guns from the Brits, when you didn't - they were negotiated between the colonies/states to prevent the fed government from becoming tyrannical. That a 'foreign devil' like myself has continually shown a greater knowledge of your history would ipso facto make me qualify to vote! (or at least 'more' qualified). You've demonstrated in the past an appalling knowledge of war history; believing that the US was the sole reason for Allied victory in WWII. Then there's you misunderstandings that you apply to American law - believing that a militia means your own self-protection from robbers, etc. That the right to carry a gun in a limited sense means whenever you feel inadequate. Furthermore, you've accepted posts from Canadians. Do you consider them American? (perhaps your geography isn't all that crash hot either). As well as this your memory is so limited as not to be able to recall when I've posted something (such as US court decisions) that I've had to re-post them. I think I've explained in my previous post that I'd rather die than be American - pathos which went way over your head.","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","11:33 PM","government-debates","48"

This would be solved if your voter registration card was received each year after you paid your taxes. The voter registration card could also be coupled with citizenship and age requirement. Non-citizens and underage would not receive a card. In the US every young man is required at the age of 18 to register with the Selective Service to ensure that a future draft will be fair and equitable. There is no Draft now! Women do not register with the Selective Service but may volunteer for military service. I would suggest that we only exclude from voting only US citizens who do not pay Federal income tax and are under draft age. Let me reiterate my proposal: I propose a less complex government First Automatically link each years government budget of 4% to the previous years GDP or GNP. This would control government spending. Make deficit spending illegal. Second Everyone, young or old rich or poor, would be required to pay a 7 % (percent) flat tax on his or her increase each year. All citizens would then have a vested interested in America. Third Voter Registration only would be by last years tax return receipt, proof of American citizenship and draft age. Incentive to become a legal American citizen. Fourth Additional revenue would be from a progressive tax for those who wish to have additional government services. There would be a check off box on your tax return for each additional service proposed by the politicians (your individual tax percentage would increase by the percentage necessary to support each new governmental expense.) This way we the people could vote on their proposals or kill them as we paid our taxes each year. Result: Candidates would have to run on their ability to run government more efficiently rather than catering to special interests. There would be a decrease in size of government, especially the IRS and other superfluous bureaucracies Politicians would be more responsive to the taxpayers instead of special interest groups. Politicians would have create a work environment instead of a dole environment.(They would have an incentive to create more tax payers by encouraging private sector job creation.,) Let it be known that: I AM NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE TRULY NEEDY BE FORGOTTON!!","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","02:07 AM","government-debates","49"

Would you think that a US citizen, who wants to XXXX up a federal building would stop to do so because he realises some of his tax money is hold-up in the bricks and mortar of the target building? I don't think the issue of paying taxes is fair - hence you've already had to introudce an amendment into your constitution to stop this (non-payment of taxes) issue. I don't recall what number of the amendment but it was enacted c.1965 under President LBJ because some states were stopping blacks from voting on the basis that they still owed tax money to the government. In other words, people have already tried this part of the scheme and it was open to gross exploitation. This is the bit I don't understand and asked you about before; but I didn't explain my concern very well. Are you suggesting 'illegal' American citizens that are voiting? - That by tying in some kind of legal receipt (a tax receipt) illegal voters would be encouraged to become legal voters? That's how this proposal reads. Otherwise - what is the extra incentive for illegals to become legal? They would already get the opportunity to vote if they became legal.","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","04:56 AM","government-debates","50"

Federal income taxes are not the only taxes that are paid by Americans. Why would only those taxes be credited? You are saying that money is the only measure of how an American citizen can have a vested interest in America. I dont believe that to be the case. This would be a bureaucratic nightmare. I dont see any of those things happening because of what you are proposing. A simplified tax system would be a national sales tax where each year would be based on the previous years expenditures. It would be collected for national, state, and local governments so we could see exactly how much the government was taxing us instead of a whole lot of hidden taxes such as fees.","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","11:59 AM","government-debates","51"

See if you can add to the proposal instead of tearing it down. Remember we are talking about the Federal government nand not the state yet. The problem I see with the national sales tax is no automatic control on the government spending, unless we we tie the present years budget to a percentage of the previous last years Gross National Product. I still lean toward the flat tax coupled wit voter registration. Those in the military do not fight for free. They would have to pay their 7 percent as well as anyone who had an increase. Define if you will those who contribute to this country who do not pay taxes. Certainly none of the parasite who live off the dole of the increasing socialistic system we are developing. Just taxing the so-called rich doesn't work. I've never seen a poorman give a another poorman a job. Only those with money can afford to pay someone else. then all could be flatrate tax payors. Also it is rediculous to tax corporations because the increased expense is passed through to the consumer. that is just a sly way for our polititions to hide another tax increase.","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","01:50 AM","government-debates","55"

How does the flat tax control government spending? Unless you want draconian decreases in government spending, 7% would not come close to meeting budget requirements. I dont know who, if anybody, brought up military not paying taxes. For one, retirees who served in the military. That depending of course on who you call the so-called rich. However any reasonable assumption on rich would mean we dont tax just the so-called rich. I would call rich as anyone that has a net worth of a million or over. But thats just my take and I dont know if there is a generally accepted answer to that question. I agree, but a national sales tax would eliminate that.","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","08:19 AM","government-debates","57"

What about the cost? Do you have to register to vote all the time (i.e. each year)? If no, then you'd not need to send the card out every tax year, except to those elligible, but not registered. You'd have to have some criteria with regards to cost to monitor this - to see if people who are elligible are actually taking up the option in significant numbers - or you're just wasting money sending the card out all the time. What do you mean by coupling the car with citizenship and age requirement? Furthermore, you promise a less complex system of government.
