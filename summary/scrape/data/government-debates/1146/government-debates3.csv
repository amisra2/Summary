"12-07-2003","1146",3,"Hank","None","Nothing is an essential liberty Robbie. People can live as slaves. But in this country its a matter of how much liberty do you want to sacrifice in order to be safe. Personally I would be opposed to the government reading my private email even if I knew they were only going to use for the purpose of preventing terrorism. But I don't trust them to stop at just using it for that purpose. The government can develop into a lot worse terrorist organization that any private organization if not checked.","theLIBERTARIAN","26093","Maybe I should start saying I think I agree with you. Hank, I think I agree with you. Also, things dont change overnight over years sometimes. Small steps towards authoritarianism will affect the next generation or two. Many will say something to the effect We have the government monitor our emails, why is it so bad to have the government monitor X. X couple be hidden cameras or whatnot. I think this is primarily why I dont like giving up liberties concerning gun ownership (i.e. registration etc). Here is California we had some assault weapons owner that were required to turn in their weapons (SKSs). This was after the registrations. Robbie, by the way I agree with your statement I would never give up freedom. I think? LOL","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","04:42 PM","government-debates","31"
"12-07-2003","1146",3,"montalban","None","Your sentence makes no sense.","kelvin90701","26122","Sorry for the slow reply. I do not get here often. Before you can go around the world to force people to do what you want, you have to be able to force people to do what you want. Aussies can not force people to do what they want, you have neither the military, manpower, or resources, so even asking the question if Aussies want to go around the world to make people do what they want is moot.","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","07:13 PM","government-debates","32"
"12-07-2003","1146",3,"Robbie","None","I think you misunderstood me earlier, when you said you agreed with me. (seems like people agree with me mostly when they don't understand me... <sigh> ) I think that I have no problem with the gov't reading my e-mail, with the purpose of preventing terrorism. I mean, its not like having private e-mail is an 'essential liberty'.","kelvin90701","26125","If your a private citizen using the you private property to send and receive email and the government is reading your traffic, you should have a problem. That kind of behavior is strictly PROHIBITED by the 4th Amendment. It is a violation of civil rights. There are only two way that are legally allowed for this kind of behavior by the government. 1) A court order 2) Repeal of the 4th Amendment. I am not aware of any judges signing blank orders for the government to proceed at thier will and I do not remember voting to repeal the 4th Amendment. It is not a quetion of ""essential"". It is a question of the government excercising illegal acts. It is never a good idea to empower authority to carry out illegal activity of any kind.","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","07:22 PM","government-debates","33"

I have become more libertarian as I get older and have seen exactly what you are talking about. And I sometimes think the conservatives are worse than the liberals. Maybe they just do it in different areas. I am uneasy with a lot of guns in a lot of hands. However when it gets right down to it, my libertarian side kicks in and I think I would be a hypocrite if I only picked some rights to defend. Still at some point I guess there has to be restrictions. I dont think Im going to go along with having the right to have A-bombs in every home. Its something I havent really thought through.","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","09:05 PM","government-debates","34"
"12-07-2003","1146",3,"None","None","None","theLIBERTARIAN","26136","I agree with you on the A-bombs. Another thing. It seems to me we have to allow others some freedom too. In other words, just because I dont drink or view pornography does not mean I have the right to tell you not too. There are limits, even Libertarians believe in laws against child porn.","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","09:17 PM","government-debates","35"

"12-13-2003","1146",3,"montalban","None","A number of right-wing Americans, all proudly boasting of their national greatness, never-the-less feel that unless they are personally heavily armed, their politicians will steal from them. This seems to me a paradox, loving and loathing one's own government. Why is this so?","VeniVedi","27267","I propose a less complex government First Automatically link each years government budget of 4% to the previous years GDP or GNP. This would control government spending. Make deficit spending illegal. Second Everyone, young or old rich or poor, would be required to pay a 7 % (percent) flat tax on his or her increase each year. All citizens would then have a vested interested in America. Third Voter Registration only would be by last years tax return receipt, proof of American citizenship and draft age. Incentive to become a legal American citizen. Fourth Additional revenue would be from a progressive tax for those who wish to have additional government services. There would be a check off box on your tax return for each additional service proposed by the politicians (your individual tax percentage would increase by the percentage necessary to support each new governmental expense.) This way we the people could vote on their proposals or kill them as we paid our taxes each year. Result: Candidates would have to run on their ability to run government more efficiently rather than catering to special interests. There would be a decrease in size of government, especially the IRS and other superfluous bureaucracies Politicians would be more responsive to the taxpayers instead of special interest groups. Politicians would have create a work environment instead of a dole environment.(They would have an incentive to create more tax payers by encouraging private sector job creation.,) Let it be known that: I AM NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE TRULY NEEDY BE FORGOTTON!!","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","04:49 PM","government-debates","40"
