Why is this so?","Hank","19984","America was the first modern democracy and a lot of the founders were people that had been repressed by governments in other countries before they came to America. We have always highly prized individual freedoms and feel that government, although necessary for the protection of society in general, in theory must be kept to a minimum. That may sometimes come across as loathing our country but very few Americans loathe their government. And yes Americans are proud of their country, and thats not just right-wing Americans, and sometimes we express that feeling so that it offends others. But my experience has been that for most Americans, it is unintentional when that happens. Very few Americans are heavily armed. Because we are a two party political system, the politicians tend to want to emphasize the differences so they can get re-elected. Most Americans have views that fall on both sides of our political spectrum. And probably most Americans feel that although their government is not the best it can be, it is the best at this time compared to other countries because we have so much personal freedoms. That of course can be debated because citizens in a lot of countries now have a lot of personal freedoms. But I was trying to answer your question.","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","09:51 AM","government-debates","2"

PATRIOT ACTII -Dramatically loosening restrictions on secret government surveillance of citizens, including on phones, e-mail and bank accounts. -Adding a ""deport at will"" option allowing the Justice Department to circumvent inconvenient immigration laws. -Expanding terrorism investigations to allow the Department to revoke the rights of anyone within about six degrees of separation of an actual terrorist act. -Criminalizing the use of encrypted e-mail. -Increasing the list of federal death-penalty crimes. -Allowing the government to desecrate the graves of deceased victims of terrorism without permission from families. -Restricting access to information about corporate pollution and environmental crimes. This would, incidentally, not only prevent private citizens from researching toxins in their backyards but would even restrict the ability of local governments to get information about environmental crimes in their own neighborhoods.

This would be solved if your voter registration card was received each year after you paid your taxes. The voter registration card could also be coupled with citizenship and age requirement. Non-citizens and underage would not receive a card. In the US every young man is required at the age of 18 to register with the Selective Service to ensure that a future draft will be fair and equitable. There is no Draft now! Women do not register with the Selective Service but may volunteer for military service. I would suggest that we only exclude from voting only US citizens who do not pay Federal income tax and are under draft age. Let me reiterate my proposal: I propose a less complex government First Automatically link each years government budget of 4% to the previous years GDP or GNP. This would control government spending. Make deficit spending illegal. Second Everyone, young or old rich or poor, would be required to pay a 7 % (percent) flat tax on his or her increase each year. All citizens would then have a vested interested in America. Third Voter Registration only would be by last years tax return receipt, proof of American citizenship and draft age. Incentive to become a legal American citizen. Fourth Additional revenue would be from a progressive tax for those who wish to have additional government services. There would be a check off box on your tax return for each additional service proposed by the politicians (your individual tax percentage would increase by the percentage necessary to support each new governmental expense.) This way we the people could vote on their proposals or kill them as we paid our taxes each year. Result: Candidates would have to run on their ability to run government more efficiently rather than catering to special interests. There would be a decrease in size of government, especially the IRS and other superfluous bureaucracies Politicians would be more responsive to the taxpayers instead of special interest groups. Politicians would have create a work environment instead of a dole environment.(They would have an incentive to create more tax payers by encouraging private sector job creation.,) Let it be known that: I AM NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE TRULY NEEDY BE FORGOTTON!!","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","02:07 AM","government-debates","49"

Would you think that a US citizen, who wants to XXXX up a federal building would stop to do so because he realises some of his tax money is hold-up in the bricks and mortar of the target building? I don't think the issue of paying taxes is fair - hence you've already had to introudce an amendment into your constitution to stop this (non-payment of taxes) issue. I don't recall what number of the amendment but it was enacted c.1965 under President LBJ because some states were stopping blacks from voting on the basis that they still owed tax money to the government. In other words, people have already tried this part of the scheme and it was open to gross exploitation. This is the bit I don't understand and asked you about before; but I didn't explain my concern very well. Are you suggesting 'illegal' American citizens that are voiting? - That by tying in some kind of legal receipt (a tax receipt) illegal voters would be encouraged to become legal voters?
