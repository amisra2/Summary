As Kelvin on another post says I have no reason to debate with anything going on in the USA - viz gun laws especially. However, my father, born in Clay City, Clay County, Indiana would make for me being a 'interested' party. I am a) interested in debates per se b) interested in political debates c) interested in this particular post as there have been similar flat-tax arguments raised here. Does this meet with your approval?","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","12:34 AM","government-debates","61"

Does this meet with your approval? Why 7%? Please show us the costing figures of how you came to this.","Hank","29070","Theres no need to get sensitive montalban. I dont care that you care I was just asking a simple question that I think anyone might wonder about. Like I said, I was just curious. I just realized you were not asking me about the 7%. I had used the 7% number in my post and yours was right after mine so I thought you were asking me. After rereading everything I made the connection.","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","09:17 AM","government-debates","62"

Often I forget that someone is not American, even if I ever noticed to begin with. The only reason you stick in my mind is because you have made remarks about never wanting to be an American or something along those lines along with other remarks of that nature.","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","07:59 AM","government-debates","64"

It was in light of several remakrs Kelvin said about how envious I am not to live in the land of the brave, and the home of the free. You are not the only one. The very nature of this bulletin board is American - hence the debate on the 'Civil War' was started up by the administrators with 'was it slavery?' type questions. This assumes that we're talking about the American Civil War, and no other. The 'Civil War' means something else to a Brit, or a Spaniard etc. But the administrators just took it for granted that everyone would understand about US history. Hence I stopped the argument on that by throwing in a comment about Parliament vs. King Charles I. Same with issues such as 'civil rights' (not such an issue here in Australia)* Seat-belts - every state here has mad it compulsory Gun control - very much a US issue. This is, of course, not to suggest that Americans should create a board with all other nations in mind, but they should be aware that outsiders are going to butt in with our heathen opinions, now and then. *Not to say that it shouldn't be.","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","08:51 PM","government-debates","66"
"12-31-2003","1146",5,"montalban","None","A number of right-wing Americans, all proudly boasting of their national greatness, never-the-less feel that unless they are personally heavily armed, their politicians will steal from them. This seems to me a paradox, loving and loathing one's own government. Why is this so?","George Orwell","29628","Maybe i am an obsessed Orwellian but i think he covers this topic perfectly in this paradox you are talking about is what Orwell called ""doublethink"" or -verb to have two contradicting ideas in your head at the same time but suppressing one to fit the majority. Well we all read 1984 we can see what doublethink ultimately does to the world.","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","02:57 AM","government-debates","67"
