Why is this so?","Hank","19984","America was the first modern democracy and a lot of the founders were people that had been repressed by governments in other countries before they came to America. We have always highly prized individual freedoms and feel that government, although necessary for the protection of society in general, in theory must be kept to a minimum. That may sometimes come across as loathing our country but very few Americans loathe their government. And yes Americans are proud of their country, and thats not just right-wing Americans, and sometimes we express that feeling so that it offends others. But my experience has been that for most Americans, it is unintentional when that happens. Very few Americans are heavily armed. Because we are a two party political system, the politicians tend to want to emphasize the differences so they can get re-elected. Most Americans have views that fall on both sides of our political spectrum. And probably most Americans feel that although their government is not the best it can be, it is the best at this time compared to other countries because we have so much personal freedoms. That of course can be debated because citizens in a lot of countries now have a lot of personal freedoms. But I was trying to answer your question.","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","09:51 AM","government-debates","2"

Those same Right-Wingers also believe in... 1. Preventing Gays from being married 2. Allowing the Government to stop Abortions 3. Allowing the Government to read emails 4. Allowing the Government to arrest immagrants w/out a trial 5. Allowing the Government to spy on people 6. Strongly supporting the CIA 7. Supporting the Patriot Act 8. Supporting the arrests of Anti-War protesters 9. Planning a Patriot ActII 10. Wanting a Christian State 11. Supporting a heavy police state 12. Believe in banning books/shows for their content About the Patriot Acts..... http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/usa/john-ashcroft/ PATRIOT ACTI -The right to freely monitor the activities political and religious groups without a criminal pretext. -New restrictions on open hearings and the public's right to receive information through the Freedom of Information Act. -The ability to stamp down on the dangerous menace of librarians who tip off the media to federal subpoenas of borrowing records. -Permission to monitor conversations between lawyers and suspects, on those increasingly rare occasions that suspects are allowed to have lawyers. -The ability to detain Americans in prison indefinitely without trial or criminal charge. PATRIOT ACTII -Dramatically loosening restrictions on secret government surveillance of citizens, including on phones, e-mail and bank accounts. -Adding a ""deport at will"" option allowing the Justice Department to circumvent inconvenient immigration laws. -Expanding terrorism investigations to allow the Department to revoke the rights of anyone within about six degrees of separation of an actual terrorist act. -Criminalizing the use of encrypted e-mail. -Increasing the list of federal death-penalty crimes. -Allowing the government to desecrate the graves of deceased victims of terrorism without permission from families. -Restricting access to information about corporate pollution and environmental crimes. This would, incidentally, not only prevent private citizens from researching toxins in their backyards but would even restrict the ability of local governments to get information about environmental crimes in their own neighborhoods. Conclusion: Right-Wingers don't truely fear the government, that is a hoax. Right-Wingers just believe in a different government.","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","07:42 PM","government-debates","10"

Most of the pro-gun people I see talk about how government should keep away from their 'personal' rights, yet these same people are against gay rights. Now, I'm also against homosexuality -that's another debate. But they (right-wingers) are being hypocrites because they argue about 'natural rights' but seem only happy if they're applied to some people in the community.... I don't believe in 'natural rights'","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","08:23 PM","government-debates","11"
