I mean, it could be used to find out who supports them, but that seems a little crazy.

"12-05-2003","1146",2,"None","None","None","theLIBERTARIAN","25711","More people were killed last century by their own governments than by wars. Hitler alone killed 9 million of his own. Stalin killed more. Mao killed millions. Pol Pot killed the largest percentage of his population. I dont know why anyone would distrust their government? I say give them more power, more control so they can give us security. Why not?","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","05:05 PM","government-debates","24"

I dont want to give the government this liberty. Remember the Constitution was created to ensure liberty of the people. It limits the government not the people.

In this country (Australia) I can send e-mails from work, but I realise that my office has the power to read these e-mails; after all, it's their system I'm using.","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","04:11 AM","government-debates","26"

I am against the government viewing any email without a warrant. If people do not like employers snooping I have a solution: Dont work for anyone, work for yourself. This will increase ones security and well being.","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","09:01 PM","government-debates","27"

But in this country its a matter of how much liberty do you want to sacrifice in order to be safe. Personally I would be opposed to the government reading my private email even if I knew they were only going to use for the purpose of preventing terrorism. But I don't trust them to stop at just using it for that purpose. The government can develop into a lot worse terrorist organization that any private organization if not checked.","why-do-right-wing-americans-fear-their-government","09:29 AM","government-debates","29"
