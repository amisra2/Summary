That can be fun too.","Archangel","261950","More accurately it's the forum for philosophical cowards who want to spew their lies without objection or debate. It's an embarrassment to even consider the time I wasted there. But I'm glad you're here to debate with. I just wish I could inject you with a strong dose of common sense as you really are off the wall in most every opinion you have. But hang around a while, maybe I'll rub off on you in time.","flag-burning-who-cares","10:35 AM","government-debates","31"

I offerred to moderate a debate. Do you know what that entails? getting two parties to agree on a resolution and judges. The moderator's opinion isn't an issue unless both sides agree that he should also judge the debate. So next time you want to take a shot at me, come with a loaded gun.","flag-burning-who-cares","03:46 PM","government-debates","32"
