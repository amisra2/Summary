And yes I see no reason why burning flags should be illegal. Heck I think in some parts at least it's illegal to have a flag flat on the ground. 1st ammendment violation! Time to stir controversy! Soon the walls of oppression will be breached and we will regain what is precious to us! The fact is: BURNING FLAGS DOES NOT HARM ANYONE! Sure it might be offensive to some, but lots of other offensive things are legal! Enough of my rambling!","flag-burning-who-cares","03:48 AM","government-debates","16"
"05-05-2007","9846",2,"None","None","None","pandion","261754","TANSTAAFL'07 seems to have been a garrison Marine. His complaints are petty much garrison complaints. He doesn't seem to have actually followed an NCO or officer into combat. If he didn't want to be a Marine, then why did he enlist? I had lots of similar complaints before I attended OCS. It changed my perspective when I became responsible for the performance of my unit. TANSTAAFL'07 seems to be what command staff knew as a whiner. My son expresses similar complaints about his unit, except that my son is a SGT and has the ear of his commander. While the First Sergeant is his superior in the command structure, my son is the section chief of which the First Sergeant is a member, along with at least one SFC, along with one or more SSGTs. My son resolves complaints by addressing the appropriate party, and failing that, going over his head. It seems that Pvt TANSTAAFL'07 had some regrets about enlisting in the Marines. Even though I have known a lot of Marines, I have never met one who regretted enlisting. But the Marines that I have known actually went into combat following their NCOs and officers. But they weren't garrison Marines. They didn't whine.","flag-burning-who-cares","01:56 AM","government-debates","18"

Loves to look down his nose at enlisted guys. You know the type, been to college know it alls.","Dono","261892","""Supposedly""? If you have doubts about Daewoo's credentials, why not challenge him?

Again I ask, exactly what did he expect when he enlisted in the Marines? Both of my brothers and I had complaints from time to time while we served. Even officers complain about superiors, honest. But how would a PVT who can't quite measure up to standards know that? So what? But if you know the system and how to work the system, then whining isn't necessary. My son, rather than whine, documented violations of military regulation by his superiors. In one case a squad leader was relieved and reduced to a squad member. In another case, a first sergeant was relieved and removed from the unit (and allowed to retire). I suspect that there weren't any violations of military law in the case of our whiner. From what he has posted, he just doesn't measure up to the many Marines that I have known. The Marines I have known were some tough hombres. Semper Fi, to all of you jar heads. I salute you. As an artilleryman, I was always willing to pump out however many rounds of high explosive were requested. Didn't matter if we were in support of Army or Marine.","flag-burning-who-cares","12:41 AM","government-debates","27"

But when I raised it in the ""Creationism vs Evolution"" thread in the ""Creation (Intelligent Design) vs Evolution"" forum, I was told, essentially, to shut the f*ck up. Threads wander. So unless you have something constructive to add, please shut the f*ck up. So tell us your opinion as to why a Marine whiner should have no objection to the burning of the flag of the United States. In fact, he seems to advocate it.","flag-burning-who-cares","12:54 AM","government-debates","28"
