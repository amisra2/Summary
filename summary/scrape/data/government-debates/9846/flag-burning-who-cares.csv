Its not ""disrespecting"" me or any other Marine to burn it, believe me. Spitting in my face or the face of my fellow brothers in the Marines or Army or Navy IS disrespect. You can only disrespect HUMAN BEINGS. A flag is not a HUMAN BEING. I had to salute the damn thing twice a day for morning and evening colors whenever I was in the states for 4 YEARS! Believe me, if people really cared about disrespect to ""our soldiers"" they would be up in arms every time an Officer purposely held everyone around the barracks for ""the word"" until midnight just to be a dick and screw us out of liberty or an NCO got drunk and beat up a PFC cause he didn't like the PFC's haircut. THATS real disrespect and abuse and no one seems to care. In reality the flag is just a way for Americans to feel attached to something most of them never had the guts to do themselves. They like the flag because it reminds them of infantry guys blowing stuff up and stealth bombers tearing across the sky. Things they never quite got around to doing. Well Im here as an infantryman to tell you that its OK if you burn a flag. GASP! Yes, I know! Shocking, but seriously I dont care. If you want to waste your hard earned money from your boring job that you hate to burn a flag to make up for you inadequacies go ahead. As long as its your flag and your matches go right ahead and be angry at daddy all you want. We won't stop you. Now if you burn the Texas or theTennessee flag we might have problems....","flag-burning-who-cares","07:13 PM","government-debates","1"

I don't think about America's military superiority, nor do I feel personally superior to other people from other Countries. I think of the history that got us where we are. The lives of brave people lost in Wars so we can be free today and not speaking German or Japanese as our National language. I think of the close to a billion people who have migrated to this Country over the last 250 years seeking a better life for their descendants, and finding it no matter what State they migrated to. I think of religious freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of thought and freedom from Government oppression as long as one doesn't attempt to deny others of their freedoms to live in peace and unmolested. I thank God regularly that my Grandfather moved his wife and 5 children from an oppressive Syrian Government during our Great Depression. I marvel that even during one of the most difficult economic times of suffering in this great Country, my family was better off here than in the Country of our origin. As a first generation American I praise God for my life here and take great pride that our flag represents so many good things that the United States of America has represented to so many for so long. That is what the flag means to me so NO, I don't think it should be legal to burn it in order to make some political statement. With all of the freedoms of expression we do possess, I see no reason to burn our Nation Symbol in effigy.","flag-burning-who-cares","08:54 PM","government-debates","2"

So you think that it was disrespectful for the picketers outside of military bases to spit on me, my brothers, and our brothers in arms? Why would you think that? I was proud to salute it whenever it was required. But I wasn't a Marine. In fact, I have known lots of Marines who were as proud to salute the flag as I was. I'm wondering why you had a problem. And that's mostly bullroar. Whatever point your commanding officer was trying to make, apparently you weren't able to understand. In my unit, a SSGT slapped a PVT in formation. He was lucky he lived because the unit broke formation and jumped the SSGT. Cooler heads dragged him away to the orderly room. The next time anyone saw him was 6 months later (after he got out of the stockade) with a PFC stripe. If the kind of thing that you describe goes on in the Corps, then the Corps has problems. Did that sentence actually have meaning to you when you typed it? Hogwash! Says who? My older brother was shot down over the highlands and my younger brother was overrun by a frontal assault at Cam Rahn. Well, I'm here as an artilleryman to tell you that it's not. Understand that I don't think that it should be illegal or unconstitutional. Such exercises are just a waste of time for Congress, who would rather discuss such issues than deal with health care, immigration, medicare, and one and on. I'm sure you don't. But I must say that you are not typical of any Marine that I have known. I see. A bit of projection here? As a Texan, it would't be a problem for me. The problem would be yours.","flag-burning-who-cares","01:56 AM","government-debates","8"

I can't find it now, but my thoughts go to the idea of a comrade in arms, whatever service. It was a different time. I was on in the Salt Lake City airport with an overlay of several hours. To pass the time, I began walking around the terminal. As I rounded one end where there was little traffic I saw 4 civilians who had an airman backed into a corner. I walked quickly around the corner and then ran to the first uniform that I saw. I shouted ""GI in trouble"", and pointed to another uniform and said, ""Get him."" I ran towards another uniform. But by that time, the uniforms were coming to us. There were 6 of us from 4 services who went back around the end of the terminal. No one said anything. The first sign these guys knew that they had a problem was when they realized that the airman was looking past them and smiling. They may have taken an elbow or two as they slinked past us. As I said, it was a different time when it was acceptable to spit on uniformed military. It was also OK to burn the flag. TANSTAAFL'07 seems to echo that time. Although it seems that he really doesn't know what he believes. He backed down at the first opposition - is he really a Marine?","flag-burning-who-cares","02:45 AM","government-debates","9"

He doesn't seem to have actually followed an NCO or officer into combat. If he didn't want to be a Marine, then why did he enlist? I had lots of similar complaints before I attended OCS. It changed my perspective when I became responsible for the performance of my unit. TANSTAAFL'07 seems to be what command staff knew as a whiner. My son expresses similar complaints about his unit, except that my son is a SGT and has the ear of his commander. While the First Sergeant is his superior in the command structure, my son is the section chief of which the First Sergeant is a member, along with at least one SFC, along with one or more SSGTs. My son resolves complaints by addressing the appropriate party, and failing that, going over his head. It seems that Pvt TANSTAAFL'07 had some regrets about enlisting in the Marines. Even though I have known a lot of Marines, I have never met one who regretted enlisting. But the Marines that I have known actually went into combat following their NCOs and officers. But they weren't garrison Marines. They didn't whine.","flag-burning-who-cares","01:56 AM","government-debates","18"

Again I ask, exactly what did he expect when he enlisted in the Marines? Both of my brothers and I had complaints from time to time while we served. Even officers complain about superiors, honest. But how would a PVT who can't quite measure up to standards know that? So what? But if you know the system and how to work the system, then whining isn't necessary. My son, rather than whine, documented violations of military regulation by his superiors. In one case a squad leader was relieved and reduced to a squad member. In another case, a first sergeant was relieved and removed from the unit (and allowed to retire). I suspect that there weren't any violations of military law in the case of our whiner. From what he has posted, he just doesn't measure up to the many Marines that I have known. The Marines I have known were some tough hombres. Semper Fi, to all of you jar heads. I salute you.
