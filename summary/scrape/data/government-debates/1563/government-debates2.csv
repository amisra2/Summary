The founders of this country wanted a land in which the citizens could cirticize freely without free of reprimand. Should we have ABSOLUTE free speech? Er, I would like to think not. Not in the case of the government, but should a person really be allowed to say whatever they want about anything?","limitations-free-speech","02:27 AM","government-debates","16"

Censorship leads to stagnation","limitations-free-speech","01:52 PM","government-debates","17"

The "" free speach"" that the NAZIs had in spouting the hatred towards the jews helped create the holocaust. By stopping the hate speach before it becomes ingrained in the minds of the young they hope another holocaust will not occur.","limitations-free-speech","04:40 PM","government-debates","18"
"06-13-2004","1563",2,"None","None","None","CCR1994","53786","A point that needs stressing is that the 1st Admendment (the entire Bill of rights really) is a restriction of government power. The 1st Admendment states that congress shall make no law.. abridging freedom of speech. There is a right to speak your mind but no right to be heard and corporations cannot be prosecuted simply because they have restrictions on speech. I don't believe as some might for example that ESPN would have been in violation of Rush Limbaugh's right to speak if he had in fact been fired for his Donovan McNabb's comments. The Howard Stern indecency flap was somewhat misreported in that Clear Channel was treated as if they had violated a constitutional right and Disney is targeted for condemnation for refusing to distribute ""Farenheit 9/11"" by Michael Moore but again this is their perfect right. And we all know about the yelling fire in a crowded theatre example of how there are obvious exceptions to the rule. So yeah, I guess there is no absolute right of speech no matter what.","limitations-free-speech","05:45 PM","government-debates","19"
"06-14-2004","1563",2,"debategirl88","None","Well, i guess ill put my opinion down now. I believe in free speech to a point. There needs to be limitations on it because it can hurt this nation like talking bad about our president in another nation. If you wanna cut down the best president in US history go ahead but dont go to another country and do it do it here. It degrades Americans I dont care if ur conservative or liberal. George explain what ur talkin about.","Black Mamba","53929","I'd like to see you start a debate about George Bush being the ""best president in US history"". I'm assuming of course that you were referring to Bush. If not, I apologize for the misread.","limitations-free-speech","06:55 PM","government-debates","20"

I vaugly considered doing it myself jsut to watch people hit the ceiling, but couldn't think of even a single thing that might support it, so I didn't. Anybody really think GW is the greatest president ever? Pls, start a thread and lay out your case. Maybe he has done something I am unaware of...","limitations-free-speech","08:38 PM","government-debates","21"
