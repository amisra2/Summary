There needs to be limitations on it because it can hurt this nation like talking bad about our president in another nation. If you wanna cut down the best president in US history go ahead but dont go to another country and do it do it here. It degrades Americans I dont care if ur conservative or liberal.

That no other nation's leader or their constituents should be permitted to articulate anything potentially detrimental to Georgie? That's outlandish, and to denude another country of their God-given freedom is preposterous simply because the opinion they hold doesn't fancy you. Would you like to duplicate the state capital of the disguised ""communist"" Russia and prohibit freedom of speech to those who disagree with you in other nations? At the same time, Americans should be allowed to condemn and show great contempt for leaders of nations that opposed action on Iraq? Perhaps my sleep deprivation is an issue, or you're extremely incoherent.","limitations-free-speech","05:20 PM","government-debates","5"

What i am talking about is Americans going over to other countries and cutting down American leaders just to get attention or make the president look stupid, i believe that that is quite immature. I am not saying that just because i love our president but also it is dangerous for our nation to be doing stuff like that. When our soldiers are over there fighting for the very thing they are taking advantage of, the enemy sees that and that encouragous them. They see our nation turning on itself...what do u think they will think. I believe they will think America will collide on its own, all we need to do is keep fighting and America will die. That my friend, will get more soldiers killed and ruin our nation all from the immaturity and the desire of attention from hollywood folks and others. Get some sleep, you seem to need it.","limitations-free-speech","05:34 PM","government-debates","6"

I'm pretty sure once they've left U.S. soil it's beyond our jurisdiction, unless we choose to vindicate means of apprehending him/her by declaring them a ""traitor"". I still think this would be a great infringement of personal rights. Regardless of how abrasive it is to the government or Dubya's image, it's not something that can be prohibited, or should be, without great controversy. I agree it's asinine to relocate one's self simply to show dissent and propagate hatred for the government. But he's breaking no real laws, therefore it would be unreasonable to shut up him up with duress. Also, I don't believe his/her words would have a profound dictation on the thoughts of the average arab. The root of their hatred for America goes way, way, way back.","limitations-free-speech","05:49 PM","government-debates","7"

I know it wont stir much hatred up from the arabs and all tose people fighting against us, but it will encourage those who already do and are currently fighting against us. i do agree there is little we can do, but we should do that little bit that we can.","limitations-free-speech","06:00 PM","government-debates","8"

The only Americans that should be there are soldiers and the Red Cross. Of course that would most certainly have a more subliminal purpose, it would still keep some radicals from killing the morale necessary for a soldier to keep his purpose. I understand their sentiments, as it is difficult to minimize civilian casualties in a war that is waged in an urban environment, but these are the ramifications of war. :/","limitations-free-speech","06:06 PM","government-debates","9"

The founders of this country wanted a land in which the citizens could cirticize freely without free of reprimand. Should we have ABSOLUTE free speech? Er, I would like to think not. Not in the case of the government, but should a person really be allowed to say whatever they want about anything?","limitations-free-speech","02:27 AM","government-debates","16"

The "" free speach"" that the NAZIs had in spouting the hatred towards the jews helped create the holocaust. By stopping the hate speach before it becomes ingrained in the minds of the young they hope another holocaust will not occur.","limitations-free-speech","04:40 PM","government-debates","18"
"06-13-2004","1563",2,"None","None","None","CCR1994","53786","A point that needs stressing is that the 1st Admendment (the entire Bill of rights really) is a restriction of government power. The 1st Admendment states that congress shall make no law.. abridging freedom of speech. There is a right to speak your mind but no right to be heard and corporations cannot be prosecuted simply because they have restrictions on speech. I don't believe as some might for example that ESPN would have been in violation of Rush Limbaugh's right to speak if he had in fact been fired for his Donovan McNabb's comments. The Howard Stern indecency flap was somewhat misreported in that Clear Channel was treated as if they had violated a constitutional right and Disney is targeted for condemnation for refusing to distribute ""Farenheit 9/11"" by Michael Moore but again this is their perfect right. And we all know about the yelling fire in a crowded theatre example of how there are obvious exceptions to the rule. So yeah, I guess there is no absolute right of speech no matter what.","limitations-free-speech","05:45 PM","government-debates","19"
