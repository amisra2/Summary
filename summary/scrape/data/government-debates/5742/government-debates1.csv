"06-22-2005","5742",1,"None","None","None","billsco","139902","Roughly 24 states in the U.S.predominantly westernhave a system of initiative or referendum amendments on their books which allow voters to vote on a variety of issues in a straight up or down matter, often during general elections. These have become wildly popular of late, it seems to me anyway, and it is difficult to find any criticism of the practice in the media. I would like to offer some here. Of course, it is our right to have this power, and it is enumerated in many of our states Constitutions. My contention is that were exercising it too vigorously. I have been guided by a simple principle in government: If a thing is good for the stability of the government, Im for it. If it tends to disrupt the stability Im against it. You could say Im a Big-Stability-in-Government guy. Initiatives and Referenda (IR) tend to disrupt stability in a huge way, IMO. We are a Constitutional Republic, not a democracy, and I believe we should act accordingly. We elect our representatives to vote in our interests, and it is this removal and critical distance from the clash and spark of politics which has allowed us to outfit a strong keel on our ship of state. Some people, maddened by slow or non-existent progress attempt to take matters into their own hands and so submit an idea for an IR, garnering signatures on petitions in an always populist fashion, doing an end-run around our politicians. In this way, modern America is beginning to resemble Athenian democracy, sheer mob rule. I think its a sorry turn of events. I would like to hear what you think.","initiatives-referenda","11:01 AM","government-debates","1"
"06-22-2005","5742",1,"None","None","None","Kronus","139905","I used to live in San Francisco. Both SF and Claifornia have initiative procedures. It works, poorly. Many laws get approved by the people, and then the state is forced, by law, to spend millions fighting the law in court because it's unconstitutional. Other times, stupid laws get passed. One such law states that property taxes will only be reassesed when some buys property. As long as you hold onto your place, your property taxes won't go up. However, schools are funded largely by property taxes. School expences went up with inflation, property taxes didn't, and the California public school system went from being one of the best in the country to one of the worst. Law isn't easy. Writing good law is something that takes skill, knowledge, and practice. That's what we hire politicians to do. Asking ""the people"" if a law is good or not makes about as much sense as polling your neighbors as to what open heart procedure you should get. We should let politicians do their jobs, and if we don't like what they do we should vote them out. Trying to get average people to decide if a given piece of legislature is a good law or not simply doesn't work most of the time. We're not politicians, we're not lawyers, we simply don't have the knowledge or experience to decide.","initiatives-referenda","11:33 AM","government-debates","2"

In a representative democracy, the electorate has little power to influence politics except that provided by an election. This influence quickly wanes and the representative often behaves like a ""free agent"" unwilling , or unable, to make good on promises that were made to the electorate. Political frustration can build up which a referendum might usefully release. Generally, the indirect system of representation permits the emergence of ""experts"" at key positions in government - who may be answerable to the people but who are not merely puppets of the people. Usually, the superiority of this system of government may be allowed; but the possibility of the people ""speaking directly"" through a referendum is a useful check on those governments who through insouciance and hubris turn a deaf ear to the pressing concerns of the people.","initiatives-referenda","12:04 PM","government-debates","3"

Given the opportunity to cast a ballot in the matter, as they had in several states during our last election, it is not surprising the idea crashed and burned. An idea such as that requires sober, elevated debate. Would the strides in civil rights in the 1960's have been made by ordinary citizens if the legislation was put in the form of IRs? I venture to say not. My point is that leaders must be allowed to lead, sometimes where we think we may not want to go, but where we find we're happy to be in twenty years time. That is the only way I see ""progress"" occuring. Otherwise the conservative nature in nearly all of us isn't amenable to new ideas. My secondary point is in the frequency of the IR's. The pols are nearly idled, we're doing all the heavy lifting. The governor of California has called for special elections (a variation of IR), ostensibly because he didn't like the results last time around. My gosh, we're coming unhinged.","initiatives-referenda","02:26 PM","government-debates","4"

In general, perhaps only in consitutional issues or matters of great national consequence, should the ""sovereign will"" of the people be directly consulted by a referendum. Elections of representatives are perfectly adequate for almost every other political contingency. However, the United States is a special case. It's a continental union of 50 (?) states with a lot of power devolved or delegated from the center. It's a long way, for example, from Alaska to Washington DC, and the federal government is probably seen as remote and out of touch with the ""pressing concerns of the people"". You might be able to influence a policy determined in St Paul, Minnesota, but you could make no difference to the ""Washington view"", no matter how much noise you make. To many, perhaps most people, the state is a more meaningful political abstraction than the concept of a far away federal government. For these sorts of reasons, the use of referenda has been conceived, I think, as a way of ""connecting people to politics"" - i.e. to the state administration. Once you submit complicated questions/propositions to the people, you're going to get slick populist answers. They won't be answers that educated and liberal minds will be thrilled by; but it's difficult to argue the elitist theory that ""experts"" and the intelligentsia know best etc. However, I agree with you, civil rights among many progressive measures would never have been passed into law if the opinions of the masses had been directly consulted by a popular vote issue by issue.","initiatives-referenda","04:36 AM","government-debates","5"

It is appreciated by many, and the respect and gratitude for your country is alive and well in me. Isnt there a similar movement with IRs afoot there as well? Agreed. But consider some of the recent usages of IRs in Washington State , for example. They have had the power to summon an IR since 1914. For the first 50 years, 215 IRs were proposed. The last 40 years have seen nearly 700, with 300 of them in the last ten years alone. And some of them are beauts. Number 344 : Shall the laws of the state be rewrittento eliminate, if possible, ambiguity, redundancy, and complexity? I mean, can you visualize two guys sitting in a bar debating that one? Joe: How you gonna vote on 344? Ed: Im all for eliminating ambiguity and complexity, but why include redundancy? Number 353 : Shall all containers of alcoholic beverages clearly bear the warning, Contents may cause brain damage, communication breakdown, and family degradation? Joe: I cant decide how to vote on this one. Ed: Did you say something? Number 363 : Shall an initiative be adopted prohibiting the possession, construction, transportation or sale of nuclear weapons within the state of Washington? WTH? Joe: Not until they pry my cold dead fingers off my You know, we consider it great sport to lambaste our politicians here in the U.S. You probably enjoy much the same pastime. It seems that citizens forays into policy-making via IRs opens them up to the same kind of ridicule. Were all in agreement IRs are a handy instrument which citizens can pick up and use if the time and the circumstances warrant it. But I think its being abused and I want to point it out. I agree with that assessment. But I have a problem with too much local power also. It leads to pettiness and small-mindedness IMO. I could never conceive of a township board pondering the pros and cons of, say, relief aid to Ethiopia, or a Mars rover.

A referendum is granted only in the most exceptional circumstances (usually of consitutional importance) and Parliamentary democracy is considered so sufficiently ""close"" to people's concerns that referenda are supposed to be largely redundant expedients. That referenda are implemented for frivolous purposes and significant issues are trivialised in order to court the popular vote, worries the thoughtful person. But this is a price you must pay in the US for having ""democracy in depth"". I think some ""elitism"" is inescapable - even in the most democratic society imaginable. It's simply a fact of life that some opinions are better informed than others, some people are better educated than others, etc. Though your presentation of the downside to a popular practice might open you up to an accusation of elitism, why should you censor yourself on issues that you have carefully considered ? You may be in a minority, but intelligent enquiry has never been an activity that appeals to the majority.","initiatives-referenda","12:13 PM","government-debates","10"
