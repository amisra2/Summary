It now takes a petition of 12% of registered voters to get one on the ballot (up from 8%) and legislators can't bury them. Every Oregon public issue, from taxes to state budgets, is subject to voter confirmation or rejection.","initiatives-referenda","12:47 PM","government-debates","16"

I'd be there now except for the fierce winters. I view the Idaho safety valve as political control, nothing else. Politicians 'knowing what's best for the masses' derived from the predominate belief system. Not unlike our current federal mess.","initiatives-referenda","01:45 PM","government-debates","18"
"06-29-2005","5742",2,"None","None","None","billsco","142471","I think the problem with IRs lies in the ridiculously low threshold needed to get one on a ballot. The initiative only requires a collection of signatures, and from what I understand, not that many for most states. IMO, a signature often means little. Some guy shows up at your door with a clipboard and you see on the last entry of the petition your neighbor's signature, and since you're like most people, you kindly sign as well and tell him to have a nice day. Not all, mind you, but many are indifferent to the particular cause being peddled. There is a step missing here, a legislative review perhaps, before an IR could be placed on an otherwise sacrosanct ballot.","initiatives-referenda","09:07 AM","government-debates","19"

"06-29-2005","5742",2,"None","None","None","billsco","142493","Not really. A reviewal of potential referenda couldn't be easily dismissed, I would think. Would it be more palatable if it were a legislators/citizens advisory committee?","initiatives-referenda","10:12 AM","government-debates","21"
"06-29-2005","5742",2,"None","None","None","georged","142731","In a small venue where political accountability is closely examined by the citizenry, yes, a mixed council would be very beneficial to maintaining communication. My experience with politics on a broad spectrum has been that when professional politicians are allowed even the slightest opening of control over a public body, they're very capable of legislating that opportunity to achieve full control. Public apathy combined with talented political manipulation is the primary problem. Sorry for the cynicism, but one must remember that politicians seeking to represent large, somewhat anonymous populations and actually concerned about the welfare and desires of their constituency for purposes other than getting their votes are very, very rare. That's why special interests and their money have such a major impact within our political system.","initiatives-referenda","06:30 PM","government-debates","22"
