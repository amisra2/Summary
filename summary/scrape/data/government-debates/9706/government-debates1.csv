"04-01-2007","9706",1,"None","None","None","pandion","256288","It seems to me that if the founding fathers of this country were very bright, and I think that they were, then their intentions to form a ""Christian Nation,"" or at least a nation founded on ""Christian principles,"" would be clearly evident in our founding documents. I mean, aside from their private writings where no indication of such intent can be found, wouldn't such intent be clear in the very documents that declared and established this country? With that in mind, I have examined some of the early documents written by these founding fathers upon which this nation was founded searching for these ""Christian principles"" to which ""Christian Nation"" advocates wish to return. First, there is the Declaration of Independence. While the view of the founding fathers was that the Declaration did not found a new nation, but rather returned the power to govern to the source, i.e., the people, this document is often cited as evidence of a ""Christian Nation"" by advocates of a repressive theocracy. The Declaration of Independence left the 13 Colonies without a legislative body and without law. As the founding fathers expressed at the time, the people were returned to the state of nature. Second, I have examined the eleven constitutions, written concurrently with or immediately after the Declaration in 1776 and 1777, which re-established governments in ten of the newly independent states, and also established the independent Republic of Vermont from the disputed territories that were claimed by Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New York. Three colonies (Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut) didn't draft and adopt constitutions until later and instead reverted to a previous charter. Third, I examined the Articles of Confederation, the initial founding document of The United States of America, The Constitution itself, and the Bill of Rights. So here are some questions about these documents. Keep in mind that the intent of the founding fathers to form a ""Christian Nation"" should be quite clear in these documents, if that were their intent. Even if their intent were less than a ""Christian Nation"" but was only to found a nation on ""Christian principles,"" I think that that too should be clearly evident.

In addition, it is no stretch to say this represents deceit and dishonesty on their part. But why resort to such measures? Why, for instance, take the square pegs of deism and attempt to squeeze them into the round holes of Christianity? On a related note, a University of Minnesota poll a year ago provided a glimpse into how mistrusted atheists are in this society. Questions such as who their son or daughter could marry, among a variety of minorities, showed atheists were the most objectionable. This mistrust is what, in my opinion, fuels the desperation we see so prevalently from those crying for a ""return to the Christian nation of our founders"". As usual, the prime motivator is fear.","christian-nation","12:47 PM","government-debates","2"

"04-01-2007","9706",1,"None","None","None","Archangel","256344","The Founders intention was to create a secular Government that would never dictate or support any State Sanctioned Religion that Americans were forced to follow. And so we should be. But don't be fooled into thinking that the Founders didn't embrace biblical ethics and values and strongly believed and upheld the principles that God would bless a Righteous Nation that lived according to His principles. And God did bless such a Nation, and that Nation was the light of the World for a time. The downtrodden and oppressed fled to the sanctuary of this Land in those times hungering to become a part of the freedom and acceptance we imported from all parts of the World. But today we are hated and the only immigrants that are rushing in are here to steal our wealth but have no desire for our heritage. And that is the heritage you on the left embrace. That which leads to death and despair. But you still twist the truth and attempt to blame the Christians for simply trying to maintain the moral compass that made this Country great originally. It's so sad that you have no concept or appreciation for who we are and how we became the envy of the World before the Cancer of Secular Humanism infected the American Psyche like a cancer eats away at a healthy body.","christian-nation","02:27 PM","government-debates","4"
"04-02-2007","9706",1,"Yossarian","256396","I'm guessing you mean America? Was there a tariff on ""freedom and acceptance"" imports? Regardless, we were exporting in those days as well. In fact, we exported quite a lot of ""downtrodden and oppressed"" people; pushed them West in huge (though rapidly declining) numbers. Then we followed them, and trod down a few more for the sake of continuity. And imports weren't limited to nifty things like freedom, or the ever-popular acceptance. Remember: we were the ""light[-skinned] of the world"" (*sic). We imported lots of Africans. Unfortunately for them, they didn't come packaged w/freedom. I guess since there wasn't much freedom around in those days, as you point out, we really couldn't spare any for them. But acceptance we had in abundance. We accepted all kinds of slaves: black ones, red ones, white ones, mixed race. If God exists, we should all be on our knees thanking Him that we're not the ""light of the world"" anymore.","Archangel","256401","I readily admit that we did some terrible things in our youth as a Nation and I make no excuses for Slavery or the destruction of the Indian Culture and people. My own hometown means ""Between Two Rivers"" in the Wampanoag Language. I mourn for the suffering caused so the white man could enrich himself at their expense. And Slavery, although started by the Dutch Traders was adopted all too easily by the Americans who justified the practice with claims they were needed to remain productive and profitable as a growing Nation. But our conscience caught up with us and we fought a civil War to rid ourselves of a practice that would have eventually destroyed us had we not repented and changed our ways. I have seen Racism in my lifetime in the South and understand that pockets of ignorance still exist today. But the Government and the Laws now protect minorities, women and all people with Civil and Human rights Laws. What you fail to realize and take into account is that during that period of time the whole World was a much harder and more brutal place. And after the Civil War even blacks emigrated to the USA to escape the abuses of their homelands. And the same story applies to people from all religions and ethnicities from every Country on every Continent on Earth. My question for you America hating liberals is why, in every post do you find a way to condemn the Country that has been the land of opportunity for so many over so long a period of time ? Why can't you balance our past mistakes with the times and pressures that existed for us yet you simultaneously make excuses for our enemies who never had a righteous or honest concern for humanity from then till now. And yet you defend them as you condemn the Country that has done so much for you personally. I truly feel sorry for the young Americans who are defending this Country in uniform for people who hate this Country and the sacrifice it's making for our defense. And that includes my oldest daughter who is serving in the Air Force. To lose one so precious as she is for the likes of the average American Liberal would be the greatest of injustices to me, and a terrible waste considering you have no respect for her sacrifice or love for her Country to begin with.","christian-nation","12:02 AM","government-debates","6"

You can not reason with someone that fanatically convinced that the christain God should be place above the laws of the nation and that Gods laws and the nations laws should be one and the same. Ironicly Archangles fundamentalist views are little different form those of the mulims he wants us to wipe out.","christian-nation","08:08 AM","government-debates","8"
"04-02-2007","9706",1,"Archangel","256426","This thread is clearly based on the false premise that people like me want to force people like you to worship Jesus and submit to biblical Laws. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is people on your side of the issue that are removing God from the public psyche by taking Him off our money, removing the right to even pray at public events away, taking prayer out of school, disallowing Nativity scenes from public property and many other long standing traditional custom that has been long accepted and practiced in this Country. Not by Christian law but by custom and tradition which the secular humanists have taken to Court to legislate out of the American Tradition. So it is your side legislating morality, we are simply trying to keep the customs and traditions that have existed since the beginning which is proof that even though the Founders were adamant about creating a secular Government, they understood that allowing Christian Principles to guide our values and how we design laws was not imposing a religion on the people but was simply utilizing the very successful principles that are given to us by the Supreme Being and Creator.","billsco","256437","It appears to be time for another quiz: When did God's name appear on our currency? a) In the 1950's b) Right from the getgo as Archangel states Who is preventing any individual from praying at any public event? a) Those meddling atheists as Archangel alleges b) No one. Anyone can pray assiduously and as long as desired at any time anywhere. Most public schools provide time before classes begin for private prayer as well. When did many of the long standing traditions of which Archangel alludes to first appear? a) Our Founding Fathers sanctioned them b) Most are rooted in mid-19th and early 20th century society You know, words mean something.

""In God We Trust"" first appeared on the 2 piece in 1864. It seems that we become quite religious during times when we are trying to kill lots of people. It appeared off and on again on a few other coins until 1957 when it became required on all currency. Just another wild guess here, but b). In Santa Fe, TX, after the efforts of the school board there to institutionalize prayer at school functions was declared unconstitutional, there was a movement to recite the Lord's Prayer openly just after the National Anthem. Those who did so weren't interfered with. Neither were they heard above the PA system introducing the starting line-ups. My local school district stopped prayer at all school events when the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for this Circuit upheld the original decision against the Santa Fe School Board. They didn't need the Supreme Court to see the writing on the wall. b) Funny how little most Christian nation advocates are of history. What worries me is that there is no Christian heritage evident in our Constitution as pointed out in the Christian Nation quiz. That must mean that the heritage is the traditions of constant religious wars of Europe before our Constitution was written.","christian-nation","11:19 AM","government-debates","14"
