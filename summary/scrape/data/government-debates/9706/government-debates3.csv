"04-07-2007","9706",3,"Steeeeve","256444","Really?!?!?! Should we expand the quiz to include how many states had a state religion after the 1st amendment past. Or maybe how many states required you to belong to a church. Or how many states required you to be of a certain religion to be in the government.","Archangel","257484","A State Religion, didn't require anyone to actually convert to or practice that religion. And I challenge you to prove otherwise. Why are you twisting reality in order to make a false point steeeeve ? It was like a State Bird, or a State Plant or Flower. Those State Mascots didn't require that people either grow, respect or present them in their homes in any way. And feel free to support any of your other allegations with evidence if you can.","christian-nation","11:41 PM","government-debates","32"
"04-08-2007","9706",3,"Matthew S","257469","Once again your true colors are showing. You prefer the tyranny of the majority and oppression of minorities. Strict construtionists usally have stones for hearts and lack feeling for the suffering of others.","Phyllis","257487","Well, I'm not a strict constructionist, so your criticism is seemingly misdirected.","christian-nation","01:16 AM","government-debates","33"
"04-08-2007","9706",3,"Steeeeve","257296","I'm asking you how you think the 14th amendment applies. Why can't you just answer. And I still reject the Lemon test for the reasons already stated. HAHA, you are right everytime? Nothing changed! Did the supreme court just change the constitution out of no where. I guess you are one of those that think the constitution is a ""living breathing document"" Anyway, I don't feel like digging up 10 cases but you can look at death penalty for one...or the other way around you could look at sodomy cases which were a mere 15yrs apart or so. Any case that was overturned would be one that meets my requirement...it does happen you know. This makes no sense. You are saying that if the Supreme Court ruled today that eating Tacos is unconstitutional than this is correct and then if they reversed it tomorrow than that is correct. This thinking is just plain wrong. The constitution is static and if a judge ""interprets"" it incorrectly then they made a wrong decision. What you are saying would be like a contract saying you owe someone $10,000 and you telling them that it is $300 when it clearly says otherwise. Some people have morals based solely on religion. My point exactly. You think that if someones morals are from religion then they don't count. This is just an incorrect look at the 1st amendment. Its about time I bring out Kurt Lash's articles on this and prove to you exactly that this ""secular only"" mindset has no basis in the constitution. Huh? Wrong on cases doesn't mean wrong for everything. So do you agree with that assessment of the constitution or not? You can insult me all day long but you haven't answered anything as of yet. You also don't need it if you believe in a constitution that has meaning. it is the moral belief based on religion. Either way, they are morals. You seem to not have the ability to realize that morality and religion relate for a vast majority of people. If your morality is based on a religion then you have moral beliefs but they are of religious dissent. As it relates to legal issues, there is no restriction on ways to think when creating laws. Yes, I've read all of that. It wasn't exactly a convincing argument either. Saying the Due Process clause of the 14th amendment makes it so the 1st amendment applies to the states is rather odd. In Roe they decided that it violates liberty...in Casey, they kind of said the same thing but stated more along the lines of a womans health and things like that. It had nothing to do with ""secular reasons"". If you want I can go into further detail about the exact rulings of this case. Hopefully you are confusing ""secular reasons"" with ""legitimate state interest""...that would be embarrassing. Right, so you think the constitution is meaningless then? If judges get the change the meaning then please tell me how they chance it? Based on what their own person views are by any chance? I'm very confused that you argue I am wrong when you think the constitution means whatever 5 outta 9 people want it to mean. In theory, if 5 justices decided tomorrow that the 1st amendment doesn't apply to anyone in the US then you would agree with this ruling and you would be ok, legally, with a Christian nation. I doubt you would be concerned about its history anyway. The religious bill introduced in Va was one aspect that helped form the amendment... The only times people have used some sort of ""HAHA You have been defeated!"" is when they are in grade school...so I'm going on that assumption from now on. You never answered the implied question of whether or not you believe in a living constitution and thus history wouldn't apply.","pandion","257491","Because I asked you. I see that you don't know. Tough. It's still case law. Still cited in Santa Fe v. Doe in 2000. I'm not sure what that means. The Constitution is a document that specifies how it can be changed and where the authority to interpret the meaning resides. I'm sure you don't. Yet another question that you can't answer. Again, cite 10 relevant cases. Please cite 10 examples of such actions by the Supreme Court. But, by definition, the interpretation of the Supreme Court cannot be wrong. Stop with the straw men. That's nonsense. Have you actually read the Constitution? Actually, I don't think so. But nevertheless, morality and religion are not the same. You continue to confuse the two. You miss the point. I'm not making any claims about morality or religion in regard to the 1st Amendment. You're kidding. So you accept the Supreme Court when you agree but reject it when you do not? But I do believe that the Constitution has meaning. That's what I'm talking about. You reject the Constitution when you don't like what it says. Either way, they have no standing under the Constitution. Grow up. And you as so immature that you don't realize the morality and religion are not the same. Again, grow up. Did that bit of gibberish actually make sense to you when you typed it? And so it would to a ""christian nation"" advocate who wants to impose his religion on everyone. Actually, my point is that you think that the Constitution is meaningless because you disagree with how it works. Please explain what you were trying to say in the part I bolded above. How silly. The main problem is that a christian nation would deny the 1st Amendment. Duh. but you resorted to insult when you found that you couldn't answer. You continue with the insult, which is an implicit admission of defeat. Your latest effort here is mostly nonsense and trashing without logic. Jeeze, Steeeeve, get back on topic or give it up. Please cite anywhere in the Constitution that christian principles are mentioned. Please tell me where some god, or Jesus, or Christ is even implied. Please point out every sentence that is based on so called christian principles. And you never answered the explicit question that I proposed above. If this is a christian nation the show me where it says so.","christian-nation","03:13 AM","government-debates","34"
"04-08-2007","9706",3,"Phyllis","257518","I never said that it is inappropriate to stop the tyranny of the legislature. I have only said that judges individually are not the agent's of that action, the people collectively are. Surely you aren't suggesting that judges apply a theory of law that is derived from a religious text. That would be an interesting way to advance the point asserted by the OP in this thread.","Matthew S","257535","I never said judges I said you personally. You are so focused on the letter of the law you ignor the suffering of others. As with the levite, in Jesus's parable, only saw the letter of the law and was unable to help the man that was beatten and robbed you will hold to the letter of law and argue for that law regardles of who is harmed.","christian-nation","12:59 PM","government-debates","37"

I'm glad you find yourself superior enough to judge me as a person, but as I have already said, your judgment is wrong. That being said, I will reiterate, with a bit of elaboration, on my main point. Judges have no authority to overturn legislation unless that legislation violates the Constitution. That is the only circumstance in which they can legitimately overturn legislation. I realize that you do not like this, but your disgust with that principle does not change the truth of the matter.","christian-nation","05:23 PM","government-debates","40"

It was a simple question (one which you never asked me) No, it doesn't say that in the way you mean. Perhaps it says who is supposed to find the meaning but the meaning is static...it just needs to be found. Cite 250 examples of where the Supreme Court upheld the Lemon test otherwise your point is useless to me. The above sentence is what your post sounds like to me. If you don't know what cases involved the death penalty and which involved sodomy (among others) then why debate with you? Anyway, you are looking for 10 cases that were overturned. Bowers (overturned by Lawerence) Dredd Scott (aspects overturned later..most overturned by the 14th amendment) Brown v. Board (overturned earlier cases) Loving v Virginia (more or less) Penry v. Lynaugh Coleman v. Miller Hamilton v. Regents of U. of Cal I think you get the point...now where are my 250 cases? Only by your definition. It certainly can be wrong...When they overturn another Supreme Court case you admit that case was incorrectly decided....unless you use the logic that everyone is right (some weird happy world). yes, now why can't you respond to anything in my post. So far, nothing you have said has any substance. You think wrong then. Can you show me how they are not related? My morals without a doubt come from religion...I'd like to know where yours come from and how it is impossible ot have morals come from religion. No claims about morality or religion huh? Then what are we talking about. The 1st amendment has everything to do with religion. Yes...just like I support my congressman when I agree with him but don't support him when I don't. You can't claim it has meaning when it changes from judge to judge. Like the example I gave above with the contract. You think that it is not what the contract says that matters but what any given person wants it to mean that matters. A contract that says ""you owe me $50,000"" means exactly that. A judge saying it means ""you owe me $10,000"" would be wrong. I assume if you lived in 1890 that you would believe they did have standing. The best way to deal with our immature grade school folks is to smile and nod","christian-nation","01:18 PM","government-debates","44"
