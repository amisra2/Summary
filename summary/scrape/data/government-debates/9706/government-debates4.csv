"04-09-2007","9706",4,"None","None","None","samiinh","257712","In the colonial period, state religions did exist and people were forced to pay a tax to the church. Paying taxes to support religion is an abomination, IMHO.","christian-nation","03:17 PM","government-debates","47"
"04-09-2007","9706",4,"pandion","None","And you never answered the explicit question that I proposed above. If this is a christian nation the show me where it says so.","Steeeeve","257715","I never said it was or had to be. I just said the constitution doesn't say you can't have christian morals as law and laws certainly don't have to have a ""secular purpose"". All they need is 50% of the vote +1 (in most cases). Now answer my question.","christian-nation","03:19 PM","government-debates","48"

"04-09-2007","9706",4,"JPSartre12","257676","Even when I make a conscious effort to avoid the gay forum so I don't get in trouble with the mods I wind up in inane debates with you. No mas! No mas!","Matthew S","257753","Yet how can you consider yourself a strict constructionist yet feel you have the right to own an automoblie when the word automoblie and the ownership of automobiles is not specifically mentioned in the constitution? It is not so fun when your own arguements are used against you is it? Raven was right.","christian-nation","05:18 PM","government-debates","50"

Even so, Phyllis doesn't seem to be one and I am not. Orginialist is not ""strict constructionist"". Your extreme black or white thinking really can't see this though can it?","christian-nation","05:35 PM","government-debates","51"

Orginialist is not ""strict constructionist"". Your extreme black or white thinking really can't see this though can it?","Matthew S","257761","I take it to mean that a strict construtionalist believes we only have the rights written down in the constitution and nothing more. So since automoblies and the right to own automoblies are not strictly mentioned word for word then we do not have the right to own them. My point is that there are rights that we have that are ours by right written down or not.","christian-nation","05:57 PM","government-debates","52"

(The Constitution doesn't mention anal sex, either.)","christian-nation","07:46 PM","government-debates","53"

So when the 1st amendment says congress can't abridge your freedom of speech then speech has an actual meaning (and I realize you don't understand this) and does not mean you don't have the right to say ""hello"" because it isn't specific. And actually, the right to own an automobile is not in the constitution. It just says the government can't take a care you already own away in an unreasonable manner. I realize telling you this is pointless as you still can't think beyond your own extreme, black/white look on the world but at least give it a shot this time.","christian-nation","11:10 PM","government-debates","57"
