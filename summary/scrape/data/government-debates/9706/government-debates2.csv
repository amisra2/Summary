It matters because they claim that they have the right to do so because this nation was founded as a ""christisn nation"" on ""christian principles."" If by ""first set of government"" you mean the pre-independence colonial governments, then yes, all but one were, at one time or another, religious in that they established state churches. There were in all requirements that office holders had to be members of the church. In fact, sometimes civil and ecclesiastical positions were the same. Thus, both George Washington and James Madison were vestrymen in their Anglican parish even though neither was a christian. It matters because other laws and practices exist that have been established since. The Constitutional provision in Maryland that any office holder had to profess a belief in God was enforced until it was found unconstitutional in 1961 (Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488). Christian prayer was practiced and passive observance by non-christian students was required at many school functions in many Texas schools until 2000. My own school district allowed prayer until the decision by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the District Court decision. (I do not live in the Judicial District but I do live in the 5th Circuit) That decision was eventually upheld by the Supreme Court (Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, 99-62). And recently there was the case of Judge Roy Moore who erected a religious monument in the Alabama Supreme Court and the case of the Bible display outside the Harris County Court House in Houston, TX. What matters is that some christians are still trying to use the government and tax money to impose their religion on everyone. Arguments against each of the latter three cases were made that christians were being deprived of their 1st Amendment right to the free practice of their religion. It seems to me that these christians haven't read the Bible and are unaware of Mat 6:6: ""But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly."" Well, we agree on that. But, of course, that was pretty much the point of the ""Christian Nation quiz."" Whizzed right past you I guess. Actually, I doubt it. Most of the ""Christian"" laws weren't actually changed. They were found to be unconstitutional. So in order to go back to the days when it was acceptable for christians to use the government to impose their religion we would have to amend the Constitution. No it doesn't. Did you flunk your high school government course? Our Constitution establishes a representative republic, i.e., a representative (or liberal) democracy. No. It doesn't do that either. The christian majority doesn't get to decide that they can use the government to impose their religion. Clearly, if you consider the actions of Congress and our President you are aware that logic and reason have nothing to do with it. And the Supreme Court is establish by the Constitution to decide questions about whether the actions of the other two branches agree with the Constitution. So you are saying that our legislatures do not take oaths (or affirmations) to support and defend the Constitution? So you are saying that they shouldn't consider whether or not a proposed law is Constitutional? So you are unaware that laws by our legislatures can be challenged in our judicial system, and if found to violate provisions of the Constitution - looking to the past or not - they are set aside?

I should have known from your above comment that you are one of those unreasonable people. Yes, I realize we are officially a representative republic but we often refer to ourselves as a democracy.

What on earth do you think this documentdoes? As for the first part. A christian majority in fact could decide to impose religion on government via a number of ways. They could amend the constitution and make a state religion, they could support or encourage laws that adhere to their views (such as abortion or marriage laws), they could vote for legislatures that think in way they do. I was unaware that christians were not allowed to think.... That's a pretty bad guess at what I was trying to say. No. Another bad guess Very aware. In fact, the federalist papers mentions this exactly. Perhaps I should rephrase so you can better understand. The constitution is not here to answer every question you might have. The answer to the question ""do you have a right to drive a car"" is no where in the constitution. To say a law prohibiting 12yr olds to drive is constitutional is kind of a bad way of putting it. It isn't that the constitution specifically allows it but that no higher law trumps it (such as the constitution). I realize that saying something is ""constitutional"" is really meant in the way I just spoke of but I find it to misled people into thinking the constitution has an answer for everything. So when people start saying ""you can't use religion as a justification for law"" I find it hard to believe this. The constitution says nothing of the sort. Even if you say an religious idea (such as no abortion) with only religious backing is ""establishing a religion"" I'd like one to find a history of where the first amendment was meant to mean this.

The idea of inalienable rights comes directly from the philosophers of the enlightenment, especially John Locke. The Creator is actually nature as expressed in the Declaration. But we don't have to look somewhere else for any rights. There are certain rights that are specifically mentioned in the Constitution, especially in the Bill of Rights. These are rights recognized as belonging to all persons in a nation of laws and specify the relationships between citizens and between citizens and the government. Sure. Could happen if you were willing to set aside the Constitution. The point of this discussion is that the ""christian nation"" crowd is perfectly willing to do that. Christianity doesn't have a very good record of recognizing anyone's rights. Christians have always been perfectly willing to deprive anyone who disagrees with them of life and liberty. Well, of course it is ""We the people..."" who established and keeps our government under the Constitution, not some god. I always find it amusing to hear a christian nation advocate claim that the Constitution was written by christian men, based on christian principles, who wanted to establish a christian nation. I wonder why many of the christian delegates to the Constitutional Convention walked out because the Constitution is Godless? Why was it that the established churches opposed the ratification of the Constitution?","christian-nation","11:47 PM","government-debates","22"

It could be that the 14th Amendment wasn't passed until 1868, and the case law in working out the implications has been a process as the rights citizens and the people have been incorporated. Nope. Laws must have ""...legitimate secular purpose."" (Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 1971). Of course, that is not to say that there cannot be any religious reason at all. Hopefully, that's what you meant to say, but I doubt it. Nevertheless, that's what the Supreme Court said. Actually, I do. That is your choice. You restated my obvious point in a way that seemed as if you hadn't actually read the quiz. I was pointing that out. It was an observation, not an insult. But I see you want to make it a flame war. If you wish to take offense where none was intended, then it is a worthless exercise to even talk to you. The problem is that you don't. Instead you include veiled insult in your reply. Pointing out your errors is not an insult. Perhaps it has something to do with intellectual maturity. But they were found to be unconstitutional. So it is true and those laws are no longer in force. I'm sorry that you don't like it, but that's the fact. They were found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court according to the Constitution. How is your opinion more meaningful that that of the Supreme Court? A meaningful example, please. How about the case law I cited? Not really unconstitutional? Here's the first part of your bait and switch. In an off-handed way, you equate religion with morality. No one has ever claimed that laws don't have to have a moral justification, only that the sole justification cannot be religion. And the second part of the bait and switch. What does animal cruelty have to do with religion? You're not going to tell me that it's a tenant of christianity, are you? You misspoke and I pointed it out. It wasn't clear that you understood the difference between a democracy and a republic, since the distinction is relevant. Your wording was sloppy, and while we are all guilty of that more often than we would like, in this case it made you wrong. It has nothing to do with being reasonable. Your insult is noted. You can't be serious. It sets out who makes laws, who makes executive decisions, and and who makes judicial judgements. Exactly what is it that you think that the Constitution does? Offer guide lines? Again you miss the point. My meaning was that they can't do it under the Constitution as it currently stands. They could if they repealed the 1st Amendment with a 28th amendment. But given the thousands of christian religions, I don't think that it would work. But of course, that is their right. It is only when those laws are in violation of the Constitution that there is a problem. Right. And then pass an amendment that allows the majority to deny rights to minorities. That's what christians are all about. But no one claims that they are not allowed to think. The problem is that they think that they are right and wish to impose their religion on everyone. Actually, it was a pretty literal reading of what you said. Then I can only wonder why you said what you did. Perhaps you should since you don't seem to be able to express what you mean clearly. I didn't claim that it was. How is this even relevant? Why do you think that this babble is meaningful? But I didn't mention any such law. How is any such law relevant? Are you claiming that such laws are religious in nature? What? Did that actually make sense to you when you typed it? We were talking about religion and the Constitution. Were you distracted by something? Maybe if you don't understand the Constitution. I can see how you might be confused if you think that driving laws have something to do with Constitutional prohibitions against laws based solely on religious motivations. Again the point sails past you. I didn't say that and that isn't the point. The point is that religion cannot be the only justification. If there is a legitimate secular reason, the the law might stand. You don't seem to understand that under our Constitution you may not legislate religion. Yes it does. Read the 1st and 14th Amendments and the case law. Well, we all know that a coat hanger in the bathroom is so much more moral and religious. But never mind that. That's no more relevant or meaningful than discussion about 12 year old driving. So let me explain. In the Constitution the role of the Supreme Court is defined such that it has the power and authority to decide on the meaning of the Constitution. Since the Supreme Court has decided that laws against abortion are solely religious and have no secular purpose, then they violate the Constitutional rights of citizens. There is no claim that the framers of the Constitution or the Bill of Rights were able to foresee moral decisions in the future. That's why the Constitution has an amendment process built in and the Supreme Court has the authority and responsibility to decide what laws do or do not conform to the Constitution. duh. Is your ""true meaning"" based on your ""true faith?"" I have no idea what that means.","christian-nation","02:02 AM","government-debates","23"
"04-05-2007","9706",2,"Steeeeve","256808","In what way do you feel the 14th amendment applies? notice the time of this case...any case from 1940 (give or take) onward is probably wrong. Even Lemon (a predicitable choice of you) has been used inconsistently by the courts which led one justice to say the Lemon test is ""some ghoul in a late-night horror movie that repeatedly sits up in its grave and shuffles abroad, after repeatedly being killed and buried...stalks our Establishment Clause jurisprudencefrightening little children and school attorneys. A fairly accurate summary. How does the Supreme Court saying something is ""unconstitutional"" actually make it so? The court has ruled things unconstitutional and then reversed and then gone back. Does that mean they were correct every time! I think no. The Supreme Court is made up of 8.5 humans (Stevens is only half cause he is so old....joke obviously) and like any human they can make mistakes. Would ""shouldn't be unconstitutional"" be a better term for you? The fact that something is currently ruled unconstitutional doesn't make it so in reality. What if your morals are based on a religion and a religion alone? Would you say that morals based on religion are not allowable! Your post seemed to suggest that morals are not a good enough justification for laws. If this is incorrect then just say so. For example, if you thought gay marriage was wrong for the sole reason that you think it is morally wrong then it would be ok to make a law that suggests this. I didn't misspeak. I just assumed you were above a petty wording argument. Yeah, that is exactly what it does. Another word for guidelines could be boundaries. The constitution sets up the boundaries in which our government can operate and within that which aspects of the government can do what. And if you think otherwise I'll just go ahead and quote Justice Breyer who said it almost exactly as I have. You wouldn't think your word was ""better than the Supreme Court"" would you? And it seems your idea of when a law is unconstitutional is incorrect. If you follow Lemon then we already are in trouble. You don't need a secular reason. That is my point. You certainly can legislate a religion. You can also legislate no religion short of saying ""you can't practice religion X"" or course. The best example of this is gay marriage. There is absolutly no reason outside of religion for saying homosexuals should not be allowed to marry (and for that matter marriage itself is fairly religious). These laws are still constitutional though as they do not establish a religion in anyway. They agree with a religious idea but do not establish any religion and are not reasonably prohibiting the free exercise of others. To go from establishing a religion to establishing no religious idea is a big leap...it certainly didn't mean this for the first 150yrs of our constitution, not sure why it means this now. I'd be willing to bet I've read more case law than most here. From the mid to early 1900s on you find case law using substantive due process and the ""living constitution"" doctrine. I reject these. Not sure how you think the 14th amendment applies other than to somehow make the bill of rights apply to the states. Not sure how that happened either. Seems odd that one could construe the constitution to say an amendment that begins ""Congress shall make no law"" really applies to the states. No they don't. They decide how the meaning of the facts from a case and apply it to a static law that has only one meaning. If that is what you mean't by ""meaning"" then yes. Well, that is not what they decided for abortion. And yet they don't have the power to change the meaning of the constitution from time to time...do you agree with this? If so, then please show me how the 1st amendment suddenly means establish no religious views. The true meaning is based on the origins of the 1st amendment from state constitutions, the reasoning behind the amendment to begin with, the early case laws dealing with religion and the 1st amendment, and other various historic documents that are ignored. But if historical meaning is worthless to you (ie you believe in a living constitution) then this would be a waste of time to explain.","pandion","256957","You're joking, aren't you? You really have no business discussing constitutional law if you don't understand how the 14th Amendment applies. It pretty much makes everything you say moot. OK. The try Lynch v. Donnelly (465 U.S. 668, 1984). Government actions may not endorse religion. Above I only cited a single prong of the Lemon Test, and that sentiment has been expressed in other cases. I cited some other cases in a previous post in which the Lemon Test was applied by the Supreme Court. One of those was in 2000. Did you even take a high school course in government? How is it that you don't understand that it is the job of the Supreme Court to decide on the constitutionality of laws. Actually, in principle, they are right every time. You don't get to decide what is or is not constitutional. That is what the Supreme Court does. Please cite 10 examples of the Supreme Court reversing and going back, whatever that means. Nice. Insult the Justices. I understand. You shoot your mouth off and you can't back it up.

Another example of your confused bias. Actually, marriage is a civil contract to which people lend religious meaning. Opposition to gay marriage is a matter of religious belief, not morality. Yet again, you are confused. You don't seem to be able to discern between morality, religious, and legal.

Have you actually read the 14th Amendment? Have you read the case law? It seems not. Well, that was pretty vacuous. Then please explain what they did decide. No. But that doesn't follow.

When you are defeated, finish with an insult. Good form.","Steeeeve","257296","I'm asking you how you think the 14th amendment applies. Why can't you just answer. And I still reject the Lemon test for the reasons already stated. HAHA, you are right everytime? Nothing changed! Did the supreme court just change the constitution out of no where. I guess you are one of those that think the constitution is a ""living breathing document"" Anyway, I don't feel like digging up 10 cases but you can look at death penalty for one...or the other way around you could look at sodomy cases which were a mere 15yrs apart or so. Any case that was overturned would be one that meets my requirement...it does happen you know. This makes no sense. You are saying that if the Supreme Court ruled today that eating Tacos is unconstitutional than this is correct and then if they reversed it tomorrow than that is correct. This thinking is just plain wrong. The constitution is static and if a judge ""interprets"" it incorrectly then they made a wrong decision. What you are saying would be like a contract saying you owe someone $10,000 and you telling them that it is $300 when it clearly says otherwise. Some people have morals based solely on religion. My point exactly. You think that if someones morals are from religion then they don't count. This is just an incorrect look at the 1st amendment. Its about time I bring out Kurt Lash's articles on this and prove to you exactly that this ""secular only"" mindset has no basis in the constitution. Huh? Wrong on cases doesn't mean wrong for everything. So do you agree with that assessment of the constitution or not? You can insult me all day long but you haven't answered anything as of yet. You also don't need it if you believe in a constitution that has meaning. it is the moral belief based on religion. Either way, they are morals. You seem to not have the ability to realize that morality and religion relate for a vast majority of people. If your morality is based on a religion then you have moral beliefs but they are of religious dissent. As it relates to legal issues, there is no restriction on ways to think when creating laws. Yes, I've read all of that. It wasn't exactly a convincing argument either. Saying the Due Process clause of the 14th amendment makes it so the 1st amendment applies to the states is rather odd. In Roe they decided that it violates liberty...in Casey, they kind of said the same thing but stated more along the lines of a womans health and things like that. It had nothing to do with ""secular reasons"". If you want I can go into further detail about the exact rulings of this case. Hopefully you are confusing ""secular reasons"" with ""legitimate state interest""...that would be embarrassing. Right, so you think the constitution is meaningless then? If judges get the change the meaning then please tell me how they chance it? Based on what their own person views are by any chance? I'm very confused that you argue I am wrong when you think the constitution means whatever 5 outta 9 people want it to mean. In theory, if 5 justices decided tomorrow that the 1st amendment doesn't apply to anyone in the US then you would agree with this ruling and you would be ok, legally, with a Christian nation. I doubt you would be concerned about its history anyway. The religious bill introduced in Va was one aspect that helped form the amendment... The only times people have used some sort of ""HAHA You have been defeated!"" is when they are in grade school...so I'm going on that assumption from now on. You never answered the implied question of whether or not you believe in a living constitution and thus history wouldn't apply.","christian-nation","03:35 PM","government-debates","26"

These reasons need not involve religion.","Phyllis","257449","You missed the point of the statement you quoted. The general point is this: the Supreme Court in the last 50 years has often engaged in revising/amending a Constitution rather than interpreting one. Which is why it took the Supreme Court 216 years to figure out that morality cannot be the reason why a law is enacted. Which is why it took the Supreme Court 193 years to figure out that laws have to have a legitimate secular purpose. The Constitution never said (and still doesn't say) this, and our history and legal traditions reveal the Lawrence decision for what it really was: judicial activism--where the judiciary substitutes its will for the legislature's on inappropriate grounds.","christian-nation","05:36 PM","government-debates","29"
