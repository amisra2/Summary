"04-11-2007","9706",5,"Matthew S","258101","Because many of the anti gay christianists who want this nation to be a christian nation are also strict constructionalists.","Steeeeve","258141","True, but for the wrong reasons. This also doesn't prove a ""stricter"" (you probably should use orginialist by the way) view of the constitution is wrong. The idea that many Christians want a orginialist view shows that this country probably once was more of a Christian nation. This is a wrong reason for wanting this though and certainly is a misleading look. An orginialist view won't get you a ""Christian nation"", it will only allow you to pass laws in your state that may promote Christian ideals. The orginialist viewpoint is the only one that makes sense and certainly is the only one our founding fathers set up. But likewise with people like you Matthew, you want a ""living constitution"" approach because it will most likely lead to ideas you like. This is goes along with your ""whatever it takes"" mindset which you fail to see is a dangerous one. There is no guarntee a ""living"" approch will swing your way. If you get 5 judges that are republican and believe in a ""living constitution"" then they will grow it away from what you want. The idea of a living constitution destroys liberty more than it lets it flurish. An idea you will never understand until its too late.","christian-nation","10:33 AM","government-debates","63"

We're charged with kicking God out of school and leaving baby Jesus homeless in his Nativity scenes, among other things. But who really has been the activist? We've learned that when the Constitution was adopted, the slate was clean. No government-sponsored religion whatsoever. Shortly thereafter, coins begin to appear stating our nation is ""under God"". Who is guilty of activism? Gradually, a creche appears in some backwoods government office, largely unnoticed for years until some vigilant citizen who fully understands church/state separation demands its removal. The Christians bitterly denounce the activist atheists for interfering with their traditions, demanding that all people observe the true intentions of the founding fathers. It would be so wonderfully ironic if their wishes to return to the founders' intent were realized. I find Christians guilty of creeping activism. I find their complaints ahistoric and without merit. It's my opinion anyone who demands state-sanctioned public prayers has serious faith issues on a personal level. I'm happy to hear of developments that attempt to stem the tide of this creeping activism. We should all be vigilant to try keep this country secular and do all we can to prevent the inevitable march toward theonomy.","christian-nation","12:52 PM","government-debates","67"

Distancing our culture from the Godless Commies was a major factor in bringing God into American instutitions. I would disagree with you that it is currently the case. I'd say that it's unquestionably activism by atheists that is steering the ship.

Just because the non believer does not want to be surrounded by images and practices of the christianists does not mean they want you not to able to practice your religion. They just don't want to prcatice your religion.","christian-nation","06:15 PM","government-debates","69"
