"04-01-2007","9706",1,"None","None","None","pandion","256288","It seems to me that if the founding fathers of this country were very bright, and I think that they were, then their intentions to form a ""Christian Nation,"" or at least a nation founded on ""Christian principles,"" would be clearly evident in our founding documents. I mean, aside from their private writings where no indication of such intent can be found, wouldn't such intent be clear in the very documents that declared and established this country? With that in mind, I have examined some of the early documents written by these founding fathers upon which this nation was founded searching for these ""Christian principles"" to which ""Christian Nation"" advocates wish to return. First, there is the Declaration of Independence. While the view of the founding fathers was that the Declaration did not found a new nation, but rather returned the power to govern to the source, i.e., the people, this document is often cited as evidence of a ""Christian Nation"" by advocates of a repressive theocracy. The Declaration of Independence left the 13 Colonies without a legislative body and without law. As the founding fathers expressed at the time, the people were returned to the state of nature. Second, I have examined the eleven constitutions, written concurrently with or immediately after the Declaration in 1776 and 1777, which re-established governments in ten of the newly independent states, and also established the independent Republic of Vermont from the disputed territories that were claimed by Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New York. Three colonies (Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut) didn't draft and adopt constitutions until later and instead reverted to a previous charter. Third, I examined the Articles of Confederation, the initial founding document of The United States of America, The Constitution itself, and the Bill of Rights. So here are some questions about these documents. Keep in mind that the intent of the founding fathers to form a ""Christian Nation"" should be quite clear in these documents, if that were their intent. Even if their intent were less than a ""Christian Nation"" but was only to found a nation on ""Christian principles,"" I think that that too should be clearly evident. These remarks are from the introduction to the test. Page down once to bypass. So follow this link to The Christian Nation Quiz and test your ideas, and maybe learn something in the process.

In addition, it is no stretch to say this represents deceit and dishonesty on their part. But why resort to such measures? Why, for instance, take the square pegs of deism and attempt to squeeze them into the round holes of Christianity? On a related note, a University of Minnesota poll a year ago provided a glimpse into how mistrusted atheists are in this society. Questions such as who their son or daughter could marry, among a variety of minorities, showed atheists were the most objectionable.

"04-01-2007","9706",1,"None","None","None","Archangel","256344","The Founders intention was to create a secular Government that would never dictate or support any State Sanctioned Religion that Americans were forced to follow. And so we should be. But don't be fooled into thinking that the Founders didn't embrace biblical ethics and values and strongly believed and upheld the principles that God would bless a Righteous Nation that lived according to His principles. And God did bless such a Nation, and that Nation was the light of the World for a time. The downtrodden and oppressed fled to the sanctuary of this Land in those times hungering to become a part of the freedom and acceptance we imported from all parts of the World. But today we are hated and the only immigrants that are rushing in are here to steal our wealth but have no desire for our heritage. And that is the heritage you on the left embrace. That which leads to death and despair. But you still twist the truth and attempt to blame the Christians for simply trying to maintain the moral compass that made this Country great originally. It's so sad that you have no concept or appreciation for who we are and how we became the envy of the World before the Cancer of Secular Humanism infected the American Psyche like a cancer eats away at a healthy body.","christian-nation","02:27 PM","government-debates","4"
"04-02-2007","9706",1,"Yossarian","256396","I'm guessing you mean America? Was there a tariff on ""freedom and acceptance"" imports? Regardless, we were exporting in those days as well. In fact, we exported quite a lot of ""downtrodden and oppressed"" people; pushed them West in huge (though rapidly declining) numbers. Then we followed them, and trod down a few more for the sake of continuity. And imports weren't limited to nifty things like freedom, or the ever-popular acceptance. Remember: we were the ""light[-skinned] of the world"" (*sic). We imported lots of Africans. Unfortunately for them, they didn't come packaged w/freedom. I guess since there wasn't much freedom around in those days, as you point out, we really couldn't spare any for them. But acceptance we had in abundance. We accepted all kinds of slaves: black ones, red ones, white ones, mixed race. If God exists, we should all be on our knees thanking Him that we're not the ""light of the world"" anymore.","Archangel","256401","I readily admit that we did some terrible things in our youth as a Nation and I make no excuses for Slavery or the destruction of the Indian Culture and people. My own hometown means ""Between Two Rivers"" in the Wampanoag Language. I mourn for the suffering caused so the white man could enrich himself at their expense. And Slavery, although started by the Dutch Traders was adopted all too easily by the Americans who justified the practice with claims they were needed to remain productive and profitable as a growing Nation. But our conscience caught up with us and we fought a civil War to rid ourselves of a practice that would have eventually destroyed us had we not repented and changed our ways. I have seen Racism in my lifetime in the South and understand that pockets of ignorance still exist today. But the Government and the Laws now protect minorities, women and all people with Civil and Human rights Laws. What you fail to realize and take into account is that during that period of time the whole World was a much harder and more brutal place. And after the Civil War even blacks emigrated to the USA to escape the abuses of their homelands. And the same story applies to people from all religions and ethnicities from every Country on every Continent on Earth. My question for you America hating liberals is why, in every post do you find a way to condemn the Country that has been the land of opportunity for so many over so long a period of time ? Why can't you balance our past mistakes with the times and pressures that existed for us yet you simultaneously make excuses for our enemies who never had a righteous or honest concern for humanity from then till now. And yet you defend them as you condemn the Country that has done so much for you personally. I truly feel sorry for the young Americans who are defending this Country in uniform for people who hate this Country and the sacrifice it's making for our defense. And that includes my oldest daughter who is serving in the Air Force. To lose one so precious as she is for the likes of the average American Liberal would be the greatest of injustices to me, and a terrible waste considering you have no respect for her sacrifice or love for her Country to begin with.","christian-nation","12:02 AM","government-debates","6"

"04-02-2007","9706",1,"Archangel","256426","This thread is clearly based on the false premise that people like me want to force people like you to worship Jesus and submit to biblical Laws. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is people on your side of the issue that are removing God from the public psyche by taking Him off our money, removing the right to even pray at public events away, taking prayer out of school, disallowing Nativity scenes from public property and many other long standing traditional custom that has been long accepted and practiced in this Country. Not by Christian law but by custom and tradition which the secular humanists have taken to Court to legislate out of the American Tradition. So it is your side legislating morality, we are simply trying to keep the customs and traditions that have existed since the beginning which is proof that even though the Founders were adamant about creating a secular Government, they understood that allowing Christian Principles to guide our values and how we design laws was not imposing a religion on the people but was simply utilizing the very successful principles that are given to us by the Supreme Being and Creator.","billsco","256437","It appears to be time for another quiz: When did God's name appear on our currency? a) In the 1950's b) Right from the getgo as Archangel states Who is preventing any individual from praying at any public event? a) Those meddling atheists as Archangel alleges b) No one.

It appeared off and on again on a few other coins until 1957 when it became required on all currency. Just another wild guess here, but b). In Santa Fe, TX, after the efforts of the school board there to institutionalize prayer at school functions was declared unconstitutional, there was a movement to recite the Lord's Prayer openly just after the National Anthem. Those who did so weren't interfered with. Neither were they heard above the PA system introducing the starting line-ups. My local school district stopped prayer at all school events when the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for this Circuit upheld the original decision against the Santa Fe School Board. They didn't need the Supreme Court to see the writing on the wall. b) Funny how little most Christian nation advocates are of history. What worries me is that there is no Christian heritage evident in our Constitution as pointed out in the Christian Nation quiz.

It matters because they claim that they have the right to do so because this nation was founded as a ""christisn nation"" on ""christian principles."" If by ""first set of government"" you mean the pre-independence colonial governments, then yes, all but one were, at one time or another, religious in that they established state churches. There were in all requirements that office holders had to be members of the church. In fact, sometimes civil and ecclesiastical positions were the same. Thus, both George Washington and James Madison were vestrymen in their Anglican parish even though neither was a christian. It matters because other laws and practices exist that have been established since. The Constitutional provision in Maryland that any office holder had to profess a belief in God was enforced until it was found unconstitutional in 1961 (Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488). Christian prayer was practiced and passive observance by non-christian students was required at many school functions in many Texas schools until 2000. My own school district allowed prayer until the decision by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the District Court decision. (I do not live in the Judicial District but I do live in the 5th Circuit) That decision was eventually upheld by the Supreme Court (Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe, 99-62). And recently there was the case of Judge Roy Moore who erected a religious monument in the Alabama Supreme Court and the case of the Bible display outside the Harris County Court House in Houston, TX. What matters is that some christians are still trying to use the government and tax money to impose their religion on everyone. Arguments against each of the latter three cases were made that christians were being deprived of their 1st Amendment right to the free practice of their religion. It seems to me that these christians haven't read the Bible and are unaware of Mat 6:6: ""But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly."" Well, we agree on that. But, of course, that was pretty much the point of the ""Christian Nation quiz."" Whizzed right past you I guess. Actually, I doubt it. Most of the ""Christian"" laws weren't actually changed. They were found to be unconstitutional. So in order to go back to the days when it was acceptable for christians to use the government to impose their religion we would have to amend the Constitution. No it doesn't. Did you flunk your high school government course? Our Constitution establishes a representative republic, i.e., a representative (or liberal) democracy. No. It doesn't do that either. The christian majority doesn't get to decide that they can use the government to impose their religion. Clearly, if you consider the actions of Congress and our President you are aware that logic and reason have nothing to do with it. And the Supreme Court is establish by the Constitution to decide questions about whether the actions of the other two branches agree with the Constitution. So you are saying that our legislatures do not take oaths (or affirmations) to support and defend the Constitution? So you are saying that they shouldn't consider whether or not a proposed law is Constitutional? So you are unaware that laws by our legislatures can be challenged in our judicial system, and if found to violate provisions of the Constitution - looking to the past or not - they are set aside?

I should have known from your above comment that you are one of those unreasonable people. Yes, I realize we are officially a representative republic but we often refer to ourselves as a democracy. I assumed you haven't been living under a rock and you knew this...my mistake. Our constitution doesn't set up a system to decide who makes what decisions/laws/etc? And I am the one that ""flunked high school government""? Should I refer to Article I section 8 of the constitution, Article II sections 1-2 and part of 3, Article III section 1, The 10th amendment, Article IV and V, even the decision on ratifying the constitution is laid out in the constitution. What on earth do you think this documentdoes? As for the first part. A christian majority in fact could decide to impose religion on government via a number of ways. They could amend the constitution and make a state religion, they could support or encourage laws that adhere to their views (such as abortion or marriage laws), they could vote for legislatures that think in way they do. I was unaware that christians were not allowed to think.... That's a pretty bad guess at what I was trying to say. No. Another bad guess Very aware. In fact, the federalist papers mentions this exactly. Perhaps I should rephrase so you can better understand. The constitution is not here to answer every question you might have. The answer to the question ""do you have a right to drive a car"" is no where in the constitution. To say a law prohibiting 12yr olds to drive is constitutional is kind of a bad way of putting it. It isn't that the constitution specifically allows it but that no higher law trumps it (such as the constitution). I realize that saying something is ""constitutional"" is really meant in the way I just spoke of but I find it to misled people into thinking the constitution has an answer for everything. So when people start saying ""you can't use religion as a justification for law"" I find it hard to believe this. The constitution says nothing of the sort. Even if you say an religious idea (such as no abortion) with only religious backing is ""establishing a religion"" I'd like one to find a history of where the first amendment was meant to mean this. Seems to me that all the history behind the creation of this amendment from its beginning would suggest that the purpose behind the 1st amendment was to keep Congress from hurting religion...not keeping religious thoughts out of government. I can get into the true meaning of the amendment later. In sort, you can't limit a reasoning behind a law.","christian-nation","11:32 PM","government-debates","21"

The idea of inalienable rights comes directly from the philosophers of the enlightenment, especially John Locke. The Creator is actually nature as expressed in the Declaration.

These are rights recognized as belonging to all persons in a nation of laws and specify the relationships between citizens and between citizens and the government. Sure. Could happen if you were willing to set aside the Constitution. The point of this discussion is that the ""christian nation"" crowd is perfectly willing to do that. Christianity doesn't have a very good record of recognizing anyone's rights. Christians have always been perfectly willing to deprive anyone who disagrees with them of life and liberty.

I assumed you haven't been living under a rock and you knew this...my mistake. Our constitution doesn't set up a system to decide who makes what decisions/laws/etc? And I am the one that ""flunked high school government""? Should I refer to Article I section 8 of the constitution, Article II sections 1-2 and part of 3, Article III section 1, The 10th amendment, Article IV and V, even the decision on ratifying the constitution is laid out in the constitution. What on earth do you think this documentdoes? As for the first part. A christian majority in fact could decide to impose religion on government via a number of ways. They could amend the constitution and make a state religion, they could support or encourage laws that adhere to their views (such as abortion or marriage laws), they could vote for legislatures that think in way they do. I was unaware that christians were not allowed to think.... That's a pretty bad guess at what I was trying to say. No. Another bad guess Very aware. In fact, the federalist papers mentions this exactly. Perhaps I should rephrase so you can better understand. The constitution is not here to answer every question you might have. The answer to the question ""do you have a right to drive a car"" is no where in the constitution. To say a law prohibiting 12yr olds to drive is constitutional is kind of a bad way of putting it. It isn't that the constitution specifically allows it but that no higher law trumps it (such as the constitution). I realize that saying something is ""constitutional"" is really meant in the way I just spoke of but I find it to misled people into thinking the constitution has an answer for everything. So when people start saying ""you can't use religion as a justification for law"" I find it hard to believe this. The constitution says nothing of the sort. Even if you say an religious idea (such as no abortion) with only religious backing is ""establishing a religion"" I'd like one to find a history of where the first amendment was meant to mean this. Seems to me that all the history behind the creation of this amendment from its beginning would suggest that the purpose behind the 1st amendment was to keep Congress from hurting religion...not keeping religious thoughts out of government. I can get into the true meaning of the amendment later. In sort, you can't limit a reasoning behind a law.","pandion","256767","Actually, that is a good question. It could be that the 14th Amendment wasn't passed until 1868, and the case law in working out the implications has been a process as the rights citizens and the people have been incorporated. Nope. Laws must have ""...legitimate secular purpose."" (Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 1971). Of course, that is not to say that there cannot be any religious reason at all. Hopefully, that's what you meant to say, but I doubt it. Nevertheless, that's what the Supreme Court said. Actually, I do. That is your choice. You restated my obvious point in a way that seemed as if you hadn't actually read the quiz. I was pointing that out. It was an observation, not an insult. But I see you want to make it a flame war. If you wish to take offense where none was intended, then it is a worthless exercise to even talk to you. The problem is that you don't. Instead you include veiled insult in your reply. Pointing out your errors is not an insult. Perhaps it has something to do with intellectual maturity. But they were found to be unconstitutional. So it is true and those laws are no longer in force. I'm sorry that you don't like it, but that's the fact. They were found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court according to the Constitution. How is your opinion more meaningful that that of the Supreme Court? A meaningful example, please. How about the case law I cited? Not really unconstitutional? Here's the first part of your bait and switch. In an off-handed way, you equate religion with morality. No one has ever claimed that laws don't have to have a moral justification, only that the sole justification cannot be religion. And the second part of the bait and switch. What does animal cruelty have to do with religion? You're not going to tell me that it's a tenant of christianity, are you? You misspoke and I pointed it out. It wasn't clear that you understood the difference between a democracy and a republic, since the distinction is relevant. Your wording was sloppy, and while we are all guilty of that more often than we would like, in this case it made you wrong. It has nothing to do with being reasonable. Your insult is noted. You can't be serious. It sets out who makes laws, who makes executive decisions, and and who makes judicial judgements. Exactly what is it that you think that the Constitution does? Offer guide lines? Again you miss the point. My meaning was that they can't do it under the Constitution as it currently stands. They could if they repealed the 1st Amendment with a 28th amendment. But given the thousands of christian religions, I don't think that it would work. But of course, that is their right. It is only when those laws are in violation of the Constitution that there is a problem. Right. And then pass an amendment that allows the majority to deny rights to minorities. That's what christians are all about. But no one claims that they are not allowed to think. The problem is that they think that they are right and wish to impose their religion on everyone. Actually, it was a pretty literal reading of what you said. Then I can only wonder why you said what you did. Perhaps you should since you don't seem to be able to express what you mean clearly. I didn't claim that it was. How is this even relevant? Why do you think that this babble is meaningful? But I didn't mention any such law. How is any such law relevant? Are you claiming that such laws are religious in nature? What? Did that actually make sense to you when you typed it? We were talking about religion and the Constitution. Were you distracted by something? Maybe if you don't understand the Constitution. I can see how you might be confused if you think that driving laws have something to do with Constitutional prohibitions against laws based solely on religious motivations. Again the point sails past you. I didn't say that and that isn't the point. The point is that religion cannot be the only justification. If there is a legitimate secular reason, the the law might stand. You don't seem to understand that under our Constitution you may not legislate religion. Yes it does. Read the 1st and 14th Amendments and the case law. Well, we all know that a coat hanger in the bathroom is so much more moral and religious. But never mind that. That's no more relevant or meaningful than discussion about 12 year old driving. So let me explain. In the Constitution the role of the Supreme Court is defined such that it has the power and authority to decide on the meaning of the Constitution. Since the Supreme Court has decided that laws against abortion are solely religious and have no secular purpose, then they violate the Constitutional rights of citizens. There is no claim that the framers of the Constitution or the Bill of Rights were able to foresee moral decisions in the future. That's why the Constitution has an amendment process built in and the Supreme Court has the authority and responsibility to decide what laws do or do not conform to the Constitution. duh. Is your ""true meaning"" based on your ""true faith?"" I have no idea what that means.","christian-nation","02:02 AM","government-debates","23"
"04-05-2007","9706",2,"Steeeeve","256808","In what way do you feel the 14th amendment applies? notice the time of this case...any case from 1940 (give or take) onward is probably wrong. Even Lemon (a predicitable choice of you) has been used inconsistently by the courts which led one justice to say the Lemon test is ""some ghoul in a late-night horror movie that repeatedly sits up in its grave and shuffles abroad, after repeatedly being killed and buried...stalks our Establishment Clause jurisprudencefrightening little children and school attorneys. A fairly accurate summary. How does the Supreme Court saying something is ""unconstitutional"" actually make it so? The court has ruled things unconstitutional and then reversed and then gone back. Does that mean they were correct every time! I think no. The Supreme Court is made up of 8.5 humans (Stevens is only half cause he is so old....joke obviously) and like any human they can make mistakes. Would ""shouldn't be unconstitutional"" be a better term for you? The fact that something is currently ruled unconstitutional doesn't make it so in reality. What if your morals are based on a religion and a religion alone? Would you say that morals based on religion are not allowable! Your post seemed to suggest that morals are not a good enough justification for laws. If this is incorrect then just say so. For example, if you thought gay marriage was wrong for the sole reason that you think it is morally wrong then it would be ok to make a law that suggests this. I didn't misspeak. I just assumed you were above a petty wording argument. Yeah, that is exactly what it does. Another word for guidelines could be boundaries. The constitution sets up the boundaries in which our government can operate and within that which aspects of the government can do what. And if you think otherwise I'll just go ahead and quote Justice Breyer who said it almost exactly as I have. You wouldn't think your word was ""better than the Supreme Court"" would you? And it seems your idea of when a law is unconstitutional is incorrect. If you follow Lemon then we already are in trouble. You don't need a secular reason. That is my point. You certainly can legislate a religion. You can also legislate no religion short of saying ""you can't practice religion X"" or course. The best example of this is gay marriage. There is absolutly no reason outside of religion for saying homosexuals should not be allowed to marry (and for that matter marriage itself is fairly religious). These laws are still constitutional though as they do not establish a religion in anyway. They agree with a religious idea but do not establish any religion and are not reasonably prohibiting the free exercise of others. To go from establishing a religion to establishing no religious idea is a big leap...it certainly didn't mean this for the first 150yrs of our constitution, not sure why it means this now. I'd be willing to bet I've read more case law than most here. From the mid to early 1900s on you find case law using substantive due process and the ""living constitution"" doctrine. I reject these. Not sure how you think the 14th amendment applies other than to somehow make the bill of rights apply to the states. Not sure how that happened either. Seems odd that one could construe the constitution to say an amendment that begins ""Congress shall make no law"" really applies to the states. No they don't. They decide how the meaning of the facts from a case and apply it to a static law that has only one meaning. If that is what you mean't by ""meaning"" then yes. Well, that is not what they decided for abortion. And yet they don't have the power to change the meaning of the constitution from time to time...do you agree with this? If so, then please show me how the 1st amendment suddenly means establish no religious views. The true meaning is based on the origins of the 1st amendment from state constitutions, the reasoning behind the amendment to begin with, the early case laws dealing with religion and the 1st amendment, and other various historic documents that are ignored. But if historical meaning is worthless to you (ie you believe in a living constitution) then this would be a waste of time to explain.","pandion","256957","You're joking, aren't you?

I cited some other cases in a previous post in which the Lemon Test was applied by the Supreme Court. One of those was in 2000. Did you even take a high school course in government? How is it that you don't understand that it is the job of the Supreme Court to decide on the constitutionality of laws. Actually, in principle, they are right every time. You don't get to decide what is or is not constitutional. That is what the Supreme Court does. Please cite 10 examples of the Supreme Court reversing and going back, whatever that means. Nice. Insult the Justices. I understand. You shoot your mouth off and you can't back it up. In fact, unless you reject the Constitution, if something is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, then it is. Now you are being silly. Yet another bait and switch because you confuse religion with morality. So! Yet a third part to your bait and switch that includes a gross distortion of what I said.

Another example of your confused bias. Actually, marriage is a civil contract to which people lend religious meaning. Opposition to gay marriage is a matter of religious belief, not morality. Yet again, you are confused. You don't seem to be able to discern between morality, religious, and legal.

Have you actually read the 14th Amendment? Have you read the case law? It seems not. Well, that was pretty vacuous. Then please explain what they did decide. No. But that doesn't follow.

"04-09-2007","9706",3,"pandion","257491","Because I asked you. I see that you don't know. I'm not sure what that means. The Constitution is a document that specifies how it can be changed and where the authority to interpret the meaning resides. I'm sure you don't. Yet another question that you can't answer. Again, cite 10 relevant cases. Please cite 10 examples of such actions by the Supreme Court. But, by definition, the interpretation of the Supreme Court cannot be wrong. Stop with the straw men. That's nonsense. Have you actually read the Constitution? Actually, I don't think so. But nevertheless, morality and religion are not the same. You continue to confuse the two. You miss the point. I'm not making any claims about morality or religion in regard to the 1st Amendment. You're kidding. So you accept the Supreme Court when you agree but reject it when you do not? But I do believe that the Constitution has meaning. That's what I'm talking about. You reject the Constitution when you don't like what it says. Either way, they have no standing under the Constitution. Grow up. And you as so immature that you don't realize the morality and religion are not the same. Again, grow up. Did that bit of gibberish actually make sense to you when you typed it? And so it would to a ""christian nation"" advocate who wants to impose his religion on everyone. You're a twit. Actually, my point is that you think that the Constitution is meaningless because you disagree with how it works. Please explain what you were trying to say in the part I bolded above. How silly. The main problem is that a christian nation would deny the 1st Amendment. Duh. but you resorted to insult when you found that you couldn't answer. You continue with the insult, which is an implicit admission of defeat. Your latest effort here is mostly nonsense and trashing without logic. Jeeze, Steeeeve, get back on topic or give it up. Please cite anywhere in the Constitution that christian principles are mentioned. Please tell me where some god, or Jesus, or Christ is even implied. Please point out every sentence that is based on so called christian principles. And you never answered the explicit question that I proposed above. If this is a christian nation the show me where it says so.","Steeeeve","257682","Ok, so no response. It was a simple question (one which you never asked me) No, it doesn't say that in the way you mean. Perhaps it says who is supposed to find the meaning but the meaning is static...it just needs to be found. Cite 250 examples of where the Supreme Court upheld the Lemon test otherwise your point is useless to me. The above sentence is what your post sounds like to me. If you don't know what cases involved the death penalty and which involved sodomy (among others) then why debate with you? Anyway, you are looking for 10 cases that were overturned. Bowers (overturned by Lawerence) Dredd Scott (aspects overturned later..most overturned by the 14th amendment) Brown v. Board (overturned earlier cases) Loving v Virginia (more or less) Penry v. Lynaugh Coleman v. Miller Hamilton v. Regents of U. of Cal I think you get the point...now where are my 250 cases? Only by your definition. It certainly can be wrong...When they overturn another Supreme Court case you admit that case was incorrectly decided....unless you use the logic that everyone is right (some weird happy world). yes, now why can't you respond to anything in my post. So far, nothing you have said has any substance. You think wrong then. Can you show me how they are not related? My morals without a doubt come from religion...I'd like to know where yours come from and how it is impossible ot have morals come from religion. No claims about morality or religion huh? Then what are we talking about. The 1st amendment has everything to do with religion. Yes...just like I support my congressman when I agree with him but don't support him when I don't. You can't claim it has meaning when it changes from judge to judge. Like the example I gave above with the contract. You think that it is not what the contract says that matters but what any given person wants it to mean that matters. A contract that says ""you owe me $50,000"" means exactly that. A judge saying it means ""you owe me $10,000"" would be wrong. I assume if you lived in 1890 that you would believe they did have standing.

An orginialist view won't get you a ""Christian nation"", it will only allow you to pass laws in your state that may promote Christian ideals. The orginialist viewpoint is the only one that makes sense and certainly is the only one our founding fathers set up.
