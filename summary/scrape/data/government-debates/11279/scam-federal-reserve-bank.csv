So I am interested in the opinion of others as to whether you believe the sequence of events it describes accurately explains how we, the American People have become servants to this corrupt and elitist banking system? http://www.wtv-zone.com/Mary/BIGGESTSCAMINHISTORY.HTML","scam-federal-reserve-bank","08:16 AM","government-debates","1"

If it were formatted sensibly, with in-place links to back up every claim with facts, it would have a much greater impact. It would look like the work of a scholar rather than the rantings of the guy propping up the bar next to you. That said, there's nothing inherently wrong with debt. Well-managed debt supplies investment without surrendering ownership and can galvanise whole economies. Anyone with a mortgage is buying into that premise: in return for paying interest on the sum borrowed you get to enjoy the stability and comfort of a home while you're earning the money to actually pay for it, rather than afterwards. In a sense the bank is investing in you, just as you might invest in a company in the expectation that they will ultimately pay you back more than you paid them.","scam-federal-reserve-bank","11:29 AM","government-debates","2"
"06-13-2008","11279",1,"None","None","None","Archangel","313181","But the larger point that he's making which got my attention immediately, and was most disturbing, was the fact that ORIGINALLY, the Federal Reserve Bank was controlled by the Federal Government for the protection, control of and distribution of the American Peoples money. When a small group of very rich individuals took control of that banking system, they in fact took control of the monetary purse strings of the US Government. Personally speaking, I find that reality very disturbing. Just think that for more than a century now, these few families have been making a few pennies from every single dollar spent by and within the US economy. And we have a trillion dollar economy today. That is what I find most disturbing, that a few individuals hold so much power over the American monetary system.","scam-federal-reserve-bank","12:09 PM","government-debates","3"
