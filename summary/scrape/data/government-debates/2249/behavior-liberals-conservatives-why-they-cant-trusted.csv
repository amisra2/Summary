You do not have to label yourself one way or another just because most of your philosophy falls to one side or the other, learn to think for yourself on each individual point.

THe bullet entered just under my left arm (in the back) and came out just above my belly button. People who say things like ""rape is the cruelest torture somebody could withstand"" are the same types of folks who say things like ""a paer cut is the worst....."". These are people who have never had anything really horribble happen to them. Go out, get shot, then tell me about how bad paper cuts are. 3 weeks ago, I went on a call (I am on our local volunteer fire department) where a loaded hay monster had rolled over on a guy and his son (the wife was driving). THe guy was begging one of us to kill him because it hurt so bad. The kid (16) was more or less cut in half by the thing. He was in tramatic shock, though, and still alive and apparently fine. WE knew as soon as we lifted up the hay monster, he was going to die (everything below the waist was completely crushed) even if we got the shock trousers on him right away. HIs mother and father held his hand while he died. A call last year involved a little girl who was in a house that was fully involved (on fire all over) when we finally got to her, she was alive and laying in bed, and had second and third degree burns over 80% of her body. She survived, adn was even conscious by the time we loaded her in the ambulance. THe funny thing about burns is that they don't stop hurting. Many traumatic injuries cause your body to go into shock so you cannot feel it. She could definatly feel it. She is still going in to get a procedure done where they basicly peel off the scar tissue without any kind of anastesia. Rape not sounding so horrible now? My little sister was raped when she was 16. IT was a bad experience. SHe got over it and moved on with her life. It was really rough for a while, and she was an emotional mess. After a while, things got a little better, then a little better, and eventualy she was OK. I doubt she will ever really get fully over it, but we all have scars. If the rapee doesn't want to go through the pain of natural childbirth, that is no problem. My wife had a C section. SHe was up and around in 3 days. She can still have children naturally, and has a scar about like a hair across her abdomen. It is not like the old days when you ended up horribly scarred (Y incision) from a C-section, or you are on your back for weeks. It is not even like your life is in danger. They are completely routine. If she doesn't want to keep the baby, that also is no problem. Do you know how hard people work to be able to adopt a child? A guy I work with and his wife are trying to adopt right now (she had lukemia as a child and is sterile from the chemo) and they have been at it for over 2 years.

I would appreciate additions to this list, but from what I have seen from surveys, a majority of Americans are: 1. displeased with the lack of enforcement against white collar crime 2. concerned about job loss to other countries 3. against illegal and high levels of legal immigration 4. against racial preference programs 5. concerned about the culture's focus on graphic violence, sex, etc. Others? I would be happy to look at surveys to back these up, find others, or to investigate your hunches. A viable third party would need to consider policies which address these issues.

With #1 you have your highest wage earners. #2 represents a free market without major government interference. #3 generally concerns certain races so to be against it is considered racist. #4 is again considered racist by the minority to be for. #5 is the 1st amendment, freedom of speech. So while the majority may believe in all these things there would be a vocal minority who would stand up against any party that supported all of these things regardless of how much sense they make and how much good they would do for the country. That is the sad fact about the current state of our democracy. It is now politically incorrect to do what is right if someone is offended by it.","behavior-liberals-conservatives-why-they-cant-trusted","11:17 PM","government-debates","12"

I admit there are a couple things Bush hasn't done that I would've wanted him to. But he has done one thing very well: He's done what he said he would do. Kerry flip-flops over every issue, Bush stays firm. I at least want a president that has moral convictions - if FDR hadn't, I'd be part of the Hitler Youth right about now.","daewoo","51723","Congratulations, you now know how the rest of the world feels about the US having them. You are right, they sided witht he french and the germans. BEfore invading a soveirgn nation, they wanted actual proof that there was some kind of threat there. Instead,w e got powell up there to give a little ""this is what we think"" speech that didn;t convince them. Trust our judgement? Our judgement was wrong. We now know the same thing the weapons inspectors were saying before. THere are no WMD's in Iraq (and no, a few shells scavenged from disposalsites do not count). They didn't give our seat on the human rights commission to Libya. The cmmission is an elected body first of all, and second, the seats are divided up regionally. I don;t recall off the top of my head who LIbya replaced, but I believe we were replaced by Austria. It sucks when you have managed to get world opinion turned against you that badly. I agree with you 100% on this one. I don;t like a lot of stuff that bush does, but he tells you what he is going to do, then he does it. There is not a bunch of empty promises on internal issues, and not a buynch of patheic sabre rattling when it comes to foreign affairs. If he says ""We are going to cut taxes"" you may as well figure right then how much it will be and spend it, because it is coming. IF he says ""we will invade"", there are troops locking and loading in the background. While he admittedly has not done a great job of keeping some of his campaign promises, I think that in the wake of 9/11 his priorities changed just a bit. I think this is understandable.","behavior-liberals-conservatives-why-they-cant-trusted","01:06 AM","government-debates","26"

Many of the worlds nations see us as a rogue nation that hs invaded a little country in the middle east. IT makes much of the world VERY uncomfortable that we can launch nukes at them 2. BEcasue, according to Blix, these are most likely weapons that were placed in a chemical dump BY UN INSPECTORS and counted as destroyed. For all intents and purposes, these weapons were already handed over by the Iraqis, and it is only though American negligence that they are back in circulation. Blix spent YEARS in IRaq studying their WMD's and WMD programs. I am willing to take him at his word as the foremost authority int he world on this toipic. 4. Libya was elected to the commission to counter AMerica. Several countries are more than a little concerned about American human rights policies, but over the years we have argely managed to keep coutries that we could not control off the commission. Libya has brought up our treatment of detainees at Gitmo (a major point ot much of the world) and human right violations in Sadi Arabia. There has been a real problem with this in Sadi in the past, but America has managed to keep it out of the commissions discussions. Now, it is out on the table. Libya has, in the past, had some real issues when it comes to human rights. A lot fo the recent stuff we are hearing is rumors that were started in response to the fact that the year we were kicked off the commission, they were elected to it. there have not been any serious uman rights abuses confirmed in Syria for several years.","behavior-liberals-conservatives-why-they-cant-trusted","03:53 AM","government-debates","28"
"09-27-2004","2249",2,"AMD4EVER","None","If it really comes down to it conservatives don't want to tell you how to live your life while liberals do. The idea of conservatism is to reduce the effect of government on your daily life which encourages people to do for themselves. Liberalism tries to increase the effect of government on your daily life which encourages people to depend on the government for everything. Now which one would you choose? They both have their advantages and disadvantages but at the end of the day you are free in a conservative society.","Dzeron","68748","Have you ever seen the Nolan Model? I think you are confusing conservatives with libertarians, and liberals with fascists. True conservatives do not care about economic control, but they want government to control what people think, say, and believe. Liberals, on the other hand, want to regulate the economy but they want more freedom with regards to ideas and actions. Only libertarians want less government, but in some cases true libertarians want more government when it comes to enforcing laws against force, fraud, or involuntary collectivism.","behavior-liberals-conservatives-why-they-cant-trusted","10:20 PM","government-debates","29"
