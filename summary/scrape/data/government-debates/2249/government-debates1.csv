The idea of conservatism is to reduce the effect of government on your daily life which encourages people to do for themselves. Liberalism tries to increase the effect of government on your daily life which encourages people to depend on the government for everything. Now which one would you choose? They both have their advantages and disadvantages but at the end of the day you are free in a conservative society.","behavior-liberals-conservatives-why-they-cant-trusted","09:20 PM","government-debates","3"

Many of the ""true"" conservatives are still republican party members, but you will here them arguing against such things as gay marriage and the like. Anti Abortion seems to be big swing point for both the true conservatives and the party conservatives. The way I see it, it boils down to this: I enjoy my rights and don;t want other interfereing with them In return for this, I m willing to extend those same rights to others. I do not want the government ruling on who I can marry, so I will not support the government telling others who to marry, even if they of the same sex. I enjoy my right to life, so I extend that same right to others, even if they are not yet unborn. A woman has a right to keep her legs closed, and should do so if she does not wish to be pregnant. In cases of rape, that is too bad. I was once injured badly and spent 11 months in a wheel chair. 9 months of preganancy isn't going to kill anybody. I think we elect a lot of XXXXXX.

Either way, both groups are trying to force their beliefs on all of us. It's especially hard on those of us who don't fall neatly into either category.","behavior-liberals-conservatives-why-they-cant-trusted","12:07 AM","government-debates","6"

I find myself in agreement with liberals on some issue, and in agreement with conservatives on others. You do not have to label yourself one way or another just because most of your philosophy falls to one side or the other, learn to think for yourself on each individual point. So many people just blindly toe the party line, which is a major part of what is wrong with the country. Mindless zombies waving Bush or Kerry signs, who don't think for themselves. Stupid is as stupid does, at least that's what mama always said.","behavior-liberals-conservatives-why-they-cant-trusted","01:45 AM","government-debates","7"

I've never been raped, but this is what I understand rape to be. Rape is the cruelest torture somebody could withstand. To have a large object repeatedly rammed into a hole on your body that is half the diameter of your pinky finger. Then, after that cruel, humiltating thing has passed, you are told that you must, in nine months, have a horrible hidious creature called an infant force it's way out of that miniscule hole of yours. To know that creature will look like a twisted combination of you and that rapist that cannot be called either man nor beast, for labeling him as anything other than 'rapist' would defile anything else that could be called by that other name. It is true that abortion is murder, but murder is a mild crime compared to rape. Once one has this foul thing done to them one does not deserve the physical and psychological torment this child shall bring.","behavior-liberals-conservatives-why-they-cant-trusted","06:39 PM","government-debates","8"

THe bullet entered just under my left arm (in the back) and came out just above my belly button. People who say things like ""rape is the cruelest torture somebody could withstand"" are the same types of folks who say things like ""a paer cut is the worst....."". These are people who have never had anything really horribble happen to them. Go out, get shot, then tell me about how bad paper cuts are. 3 weeks ago, I went on a call (I am on our local volunteer fire department) where a loaded hay monster had rolled over on a guy and his son (the wife was driving). THe guy was begging one of us to kill him because it hurt so bad. The kid (16) was more or less cut in half by the thing. He was in tramatic shock, though, and still alive and apparently fine. WE knew as soon as we lifted up the hay monster, he was going to die (everything below the waist was completely crushed) even if we got the shock trousers on him right away. HIs mother and father held his hand while he died. A call last year involved a little girl who was in a house that was fully involved (on fire all over) when we finally got to her, she was alive and laying in bed, and had second and third degree burns over 80% of her body. She survived, adn was even conscious by the time we loaded her in the ambulance. THe funny thing about burns is that they don't stop hurting. Many traumatic injuries cause your body to go into shock so you cannot feel it. She could definatly feel it. She is still going in to get a procedure done where they basicly peel off the scar tissue without any kind of anastesia. Rape not sounding so horrible now? My little sister was raped when she was 16. IT was a bad experience. SHe got over it and moved on with her life. It was really rough for a while, and she was an emotional mess. After a while, things got a little better, then a little better, and eventualy she was OK. I doubt she will ever really get fully over it, but we all have scars. If the rapee doesn't want to go through the pain of natural childbirth, that is no problem. My wife had a C section. SHe was up and around in 3 days. She can still have children naturally, and has a scar about like a hair across her abdomen. It is not like the old days when you ended up horribly scarred (Y incision) from a C-section, or you are on your back for weeks. It is not even like your life is in danger. They are completely routine. If she doesn't want to keep the baby, that also is no problem. Do you know how hard people work to be able to adopt a child? A guy I work with and his wife are trying to adopt right now (she had lukemia as a child and is sterile from the chemo) and they have been at it for over 2 years. They have spent a small fortune on adoption agencies.

"05-04-2004","2249",1,"None","None","None","Sigma","47604","There are some great debates on abortion in the abortion subforum, to which both arguments are addressed. If you want to discuss whether abortion is murder (murder is unlawful killing. If abortion is legal then it cannot by definition be murder), many informed opinions are there. I agree with Sundowner that agreeing simply because you identify with the party is idiotic. I see the behavior a lot, being much more liberal than the rest of my family. They will go to great length to justify everything Bush does, all the while critisizing Kerry for doing the same thing :P Hardcore Democrats do the same thing, I'm sure, but I don't have as much oportunity to see them in action.","behavior-liberals-conservatives-why-they-cant-trusted","06:15 AM","government-debates","10"
"05-04-2004","2249",1,"None","None","None","galton","47747","One way to look at the issue is what policies are popular among citizens but are ignored by both major parties. I would appreciate additions to this list, but from what I have seen from surveys, a majority of Americans are: 1. displeased with the lack of enforcement against white collar crime 2. concerned about job loss to other countries 3. against illegal and high levels of legal immigration 4. against racial preference programs 5. concerned about the culture's focus on graphic violence, sex, etc. Others? I would be happy to look at surveys to back these up, find others, or to investigate your hunches. A viable third party would need to consider policies which address these issues. An additional question is why does neither party represent the majority on these issues?","behavior-liberals-conservatives-why-they-cant-trusted","08:29 PM","government-debates","11"

With #1 you have your highest wage earners. #2 represents a free market without major government interference. #3 generally concerns certain races so to be against it is considered racist. #4 is again considered racist by the minority to be for. #5 is the 1st amendment, freedom of speech. So while the majority may believe in all these things there would be a vocal minority who would stand up against any party that supported all of these things regardless of how much sense they make and how much good they would do for the country. That is the sad fact about the current state of our democracy. It is now politically incorrect to do what is right if someone is offended by it.","behavior-liberals-conservatives-why-they-cant-trusted","11:17 PM","government-debates","12"
