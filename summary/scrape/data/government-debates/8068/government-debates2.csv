"05-14-2006","8068",2,"Jo Bennett","None","So in what sense are you centre-right then? If it's the racism that puts you off the tories, then what do you have left? With ASBOs and the criminalisation of protest I can't imagine you want something more right wing on the law and order front (if you do then I'm gonig to suggest your not so much centre right as far right ). The labour party hasn't changed. Talk to grassroots labour supporters and you'll find most of them want better trade union rights, higher income taxes on high earners, and a hell of a lot of them are anti-nuclear. What's changed is that they're disillusioned with this labour government, which rather than being red, has been a sort of tepid purple. The same thing will happen to the tories under Cameron, they'll be happy for a while if it brings them victory, but when they've just got more Blair out of it, they'll start to get angry. The party leaderships, almost by necessity, represent one extreme of their party. On Barking, you have to recall the the US fascists are usually economically right wing, low tax et al, whereas the BNP are more traditional nazis, mainly authoritarian with fairly left wing economic positions. Plus their claims to Christianity are far less fervent than those in the US.","Phunting","212922","I do, in a way. Obviously I don't approve of the anti-free speach element to the new terror laws, but I certainly believe in harsher sentencing. I also agree with the Tories on education, I believe in higher budget for the armed forces, and yes, I'm pro-monarchy. Does this make me far right? I don't think so. Especially as I also believe in legalization of drugs, high taxation, more open immigration, Europe, National Health. In the end I think I have strong left and right views, so average out in the centre! Maybe. But I can't see Labour ever going back as far left, even post-Tony. In the same way I think the Tories will be pulled towards the centre too. Of course, I do understand they are two very different forms of right-wing. I was just being flippant.","uk-local-elections","04:44 PM","government-debates","16"

High sentences for what it the question? If you mean higher sentences for eg rapists then I wouldn't say that's a right wing position. If for burglars then I'd say it was. Basically I'd suggest that protection of people is a leftie thing, protection of property a rightie thing. Also depends on what you mean by harsher. Do you really think that locknig people up is effective at reducing crime? (except in the most obvious sense) Surely community sentences make more sense for offenders who aren't dangerous to people? We already have one of the highest military spends in Europe, what on earth do you want to spend more money on? It's interesting to talk to someone who has an unusual mix of views.","uk-local-elections","05:15 PM","government-debates","17"

Though that said Lords reform could be said to be closely linked to the subject. Agreed. I'm not of the 'bang 'em up' camp at all. I agree with community orders and custodial orders where appropriate. I just feel that terms should be increased. That in general a sentence, especially when you take into consideration reductions for good behavior, is not enough of a deterrent. The current scrabble for headlines by Labour seems to vindicate this view somewhat. Guns that can shoot properly. Adequate protection for troops and aircraft in the field. An end to the list of MoD equipment that has been brought into service on a tight budget and then shown to be majorly flawed... Indeed. It's a bit annoying having such a mix of views as I generally disagree with every party about some major policy point. Makes voting tricky. Then again not trusting all the parties is probably a sensible thing anyway...","uk-local-elections","04:34 PM","government-debates","18"
"05-16-2006","8068",2,"Jo Bennett","None","Except MOD equipment usually runs heavily over budget and is STILL faulty (Chinook helicopters anyone?). The cost of small arms is tiny compared to the cost of renewing or replacing Trident, the obvious solution is to scrap the submarine based penis extension for the prime minister and spend money on low tech stuff like language training, and various other skills and equipment required for peace keeping, which is our army's main role. These sorts of things cost a lot less than the headline grabbing weapons systems and big shiny tanks. Sir Humphrey: Bernard, what is the purpose of our defence policy? Bernard: To defend Britain. Sir Humphrey: No, Bernard. It is to make people believe Britain is defended. Bernard: The Russians? Sir Humphrey: Not the Russians, the British! The Russians know it is not. On crime, I think the reason sentences are not a deterrent is not because they are not long enough (I doubt the average rapist weighs up 8 years in jail as being worth what he wants to do) but that criminals don't expect to be caught. The answer then has to be to deal with the social issues that make criminal behaviour more likely, and work on improving conviction rates. We have the highest prison population in Europe and it hasn't had much impact on crime.","Phunting","213298","Mostly because the budget isn't sufficient in the first place, so the job is bodged and we end up with the worst of both worlds: expensive and sh*te. Again, agreed. One of the truest quotes I've ever heard is from Yes, Minister: And I agree with Humpy that this is an important factor. Which is why we need a defence budget that can cover the headline grabbing placebos and actually do the job. Not just the former as we have now... I think it is both. Obviously it would be wonderful to have the conviction rate go up. However custody is still a deterrent, to an extent. Yes there will be a point when the crime will be committed no matter the sentence, and yes no criminal ever thinks they will be caught. But I still believe in order for it to be a more effective deterrent the initial sentencing needs to be harsher.","uk-local-elections","06:55 PM","government-debates","20"
