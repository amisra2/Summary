Sorry if that sounds a bit harsh, but I despise the tories with a passion, they care nothing for anyone earning less than about 50k/year, they have no understanding of poverty or unemployment or the benefits system. They don't understand state education or healthcare because they don't use it. What I've noticed is how much emphasis the media of putting on the BNP, yes they're fascists but they won 13 seats, the Greens gained more than that and hardly get a mention.

Considering the abject failure in almost every respect of Blair's Government (about the only good thing has been the giving of control of the Bank Rate to the Bank of England) and a Government as covered in sleaze as John Major's was, if not more so then voting for the Conservatives is a reasonable option. Certainly if your serious about having good Government. A very healthy number of people seem to think so and the vast majority will be normal hard working individuals the vast majority of whom would be on perfectly normal salaries.","uk-local-elections","09:51 AM","government-debates","3"

The tory party may have working class supporters, some bought in the Thatcher era by right to buy, which screwed and is continuing to screw those currently in need of local authority housing, but its interests, like new labour's (only more so) are those of big business. I'm not too young to remember tory cuts to healthcare and education, or the poll tax, or the cuts in income tax paid for by increases in regressive taxation. Nothing I've seen suggests that the tories have changed or are likely to change. Their recent green gloss has been nothing more than a publicity stunt, they've shown no commitment to getting cars and trucks off the road, to improving public transport, to making the tough choices that need to be made to implement renewable energy. I don't trust Blair as far as I can throw him, I don't trust Cameron enough to even pick him up. While we're on the subject lib dem insiders suggest Ming Cambell's a nasty piece of work as well, and the lib dems have been swinging too much to the right recently anyway. I've voted Green at every opportunity since I turned 18.","uk-local-elections","01:45 PM","government-debates","4"

Please be aware by the way that I have long worked in a multi-cultural environment both here and abroad and that relatives of mine are from ethnic backgrounds. I cannot believe that a 2 centuries old mindset and environment has any relevance today. What happened then happened them when ethics and beliefs were what they were then. Still I suppose it all still rumbles on see Northern Ireland. I cannot but agree with you on the state of the other parties & personally feel that the state of the parties is the worst I have seen in many a long year. My own vote goes to the party I think can do the least harm; I have no trust in any of them doing the most good.","uk-local-elections","09:54 AM","government-debates","5"

Well firstly, I voted according to local council issues and not just as a popularity contest for whichever joker in Westminster. The local Labour party here has been increasingly ineffectual IMHO, with nothing but a vague smugness to them. The local Tories have been heavily involved in campaigning on various issue throughout the community, hence they got my vote. That said I'm very close to voting Tory next general election. I'm centre right, hence have voted Labour previously. I certainly wouldn't say the Tories were any more 'lying toe rags' than Labour, or any other politician. The racism issue has been the biggest off put to me in the past, I had huge issues over Tory policy on immigration and asylum. However I'm reasonably hopeful that under Cameron such things will not become policy.","uk-local-elections","07:14 PM","government-debates","6"

With ASBOs and the criminalisation of protest I can't imagine you want something more right wing on the law and order front (if you do then I'm gonig to suggest your not so much centre right as far right ). The labour party hasn't changed. Talk to grassroots labour supporters and you'll find most of them want better trade union rights, higher income taxes on high earners, and a hell of a lot of them are anti-nuclear. What's changed is that they're disillusioned with this labour government, which rather than being red, has been a sort of tepid purple. The same thing will happen to the tories under Cameron, they'll be happy for a while if it brings them victory, but when they've just got more Blair out of it, they'll start to get angry. The party leaderships, almost by necessity, represent one extreme of their party. On Barking, you have to recall the the US fascists are usually economically right wing, low tax et al, whereas the BNP are more traditional nazis, mainly authoritarian with fairly left wing economic positions. Plus their claims to Christianity are far less fervent than those in the US.","uk-local-elections","01:57 PM","government-debates","11"

Obviously I don't approve of the anti-free speach element to the new terror laws, but I certainly believe in harsher sentencing. I also agree with the Tories on education, I believe in higher budget for the armed forces, and yes, I'm pro-monarchy. Does this make me far right? I don't think so. Especially as I also believe in legalization of drugs, high taxation, more open immigration, Europe, National Health. In the end I think I have strong left and right views, so average out in the centre! Maybe. But I can't see Labour ever going back as far left, even post-Tony. In the same way I think the Tories will be pulled towards the centre too. Of course, I do understand they are two very different forms of right-wing. I was just being flippant.","uk-local-elections","04:44 PM","government-debates","16"

High sentences for what it the question? If you mean higher sentences for eg rapists then I wouldn't say that's a right wing position. If for burglars then I'd say it was. Basically I'd suggest that protection of people is a leftie thing, protection of property a rightie thing. Also depends on what you mean by harsher. Do you really think that locknig people up is effective at reducing crime? (except in the most obvious sense) Surely community sentences make more sense for offenders who aren't dangerous to people? We already have one of the highest military spends in Europe, what on earth do you want to spend more money on?

Though that said Lords reform could be said to be closely linked to the subject. Agreed. I'm not of the 'bang 'em up' camp at all. I agree with community orders and custodial orders where appropriate. I just feel that terms should be increased. That in general a sentence, especially when you take into consideration reductions for good behavior, is not enough of a deterrent. The current scrabble for headlines by Labour seems to vindicate this view somewhat. Guns that can shoot properly. Adequate protection for troops and aircraft in the field. An end to the list of MoD equipment that has been brought into service on a tight budget and then shown to be majorly flawed... Indeed. It's a bit annoying having such a mix of views as I generally disagree with every party about some major policy point. Makes voting tricky. Then again not trusting all the parties is probably a sensible thing anyway...","uk-local-elections","04:34 PM","government-debates","18"
"05-16-2006","8068",2,"Jo Bennett","None","Except MOD equipment usually runs heavily over budget and is STILL faulty (Chinook helicopters anyone?). The cost of small arms is tiny compared to the cost of renewing or replacing Trident, the obvious solution is to scrap the submarine based penis extension for the prime minister and spend money on low tech stuff like language training, and various other skills and equipment required for peace keeping, which is our army's main role. These sorts of things cost a lot less than the headline grabbing weapons systems and big shiny tanks. Sir Humphrey: Bernard, what is the purpose of our defence policy? Bernard: To defend Britain. Sir Humphrey: No, Bernard. It is to make people believe Britain is defended. Bernard: The Russians? Sir Humphrey: Not the Russians, the British! The Russians know it is not. On crime, I think the reason sentences are not a deterrent is not because they are not long enough (I doubt the average rapist weighs up 8 years in jail as being worth what he wants to do) but that criminals don't expect to be caught. The answer then has to be to deal with the social issues that make criminal behaviour more likely, and work on improving conviction rates. We have the highest prison population in Europe and it hasn't had much impact on crime.","Phunting","213298","Mostly because the budget isn't sufficient in the first place, so the job is bodged and we end up with the worst of both worlds: expensive and sh*te. Again, agreed. One of the truest quotes I've ever heard is from Yes, Minister: And I agree with Humpy that this is an important factor. Which is why we need a defence budget that can cover the headline grabbing placebos and actually do the job. Not just the former as we have now... I think it is both. Obviously it would be wonderful to have the conviction rate go up. However custody is still a deterrent, to an extent. Yes there will be a point when the crime will be committed no matter the sentence, and yes no criminal ever thinks they will be caught. But I still believe in order for it to be a more effective deterrent the initial sentencing needs to be harsher.","uk-local-elections","06:55 PM","government-debates","20"
