The schooling of the pilots in our own simulators took place under Slick Willy Clinton's watch. Osama Bin laden was let go after being offered to us on a platter...multiple times...again under Slick Willy's watch. The USS Cole was attacked under Slick Willy's watch. The WTC was bombed in February, 1993 under Slick Willy's watch. Two US Embassies were bombed in August, 1998, again under Slick Willy's watch. I still do not blame Slick Willy for any of these attacks. I blame the terrorists that performed the deeds...and I see no need to call them victims simply because they are being treated with little respect after being caught. Our precious Obama, the Messiah in Chief and Savior of the Western World Socialist Order has now lifted the term ""enemy combatant"" from them, in preparation for releasing them back into society so they can do us more harm. I will blame his sorry XXX for that...when it comes to pass.","bush-i-will-leave-office-my-head-held-high","12:24 PM","government-debates","16"

Would his running out of the room have made any difference in the outcome that day? Did those 7 minutes cost any lives, or delay our retaliation against the enemy? I don't really care for the job the man did as president, but for crying out loud...let it go. Was he supposed to jump up like he saw the bat symbol and run for the batmobile?","simone","347116","Bush could have acted like a competent executive, stood up immediately and said, ""Excuse me, kids, there's a bit of a national emergency occurring and I've got some business to attend to."" Then, a competent executive would have left, gotten to a communications center to find out where he, the chief executive of the nation, should be. It might not have been advisable for him to return to Washington, D.C. Nevertheless, he, the chief executive of the nation, should have imimediately made arrangements for constant communications with all necessary branches of government, including Congress, the military, various state governments, telling them to be on the alert and ready to move. A competent executive moves. He, or she, is not paralyzed with fear as Bush was.","bush-i-will-leave-office-my-head-held-high","01:40 PM","government-debates","17"

That the chief executive of my nation was paralyzed with fear at that moment. I needed a national chief executive who moved, who was active, who was decisive, who took command immediately.

That Slick Willie? But as he and mature, intelligent, well informed adults seem to understand, It is not Cliton or Bush, or Cheney, or Rumsfeld, or Tenet who are responsible for 9/11. It is the terrorists who planned and perpetrated the act who are to blame. If you want to look at who did not do enough to stop it, then please don't just stop at Bush and Co., keep going back at least to the Truman administration, if not before. Seems to me that we had a similar situation some 60 years before 9/11.","bush-i-will-leave-office-my-head-held-high","04:56 PM","government-debates","22"

"03-19-2009","12088",2,"foundit66","347251","On that subject, the failure was on a variety of levels. Communication problems between departments that existed in previous administrations as well. I see no reason to put it at Bush's feet exclusively, if at all. Osama Bin Laden: How the U.S. helped midwife a terrorist This article details how it was a lot more than just the U.S. $$$ which was involved in energizing the bin Laden beast... Russia was falling anyways, regardless of our U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. The problems that Russia had was present in its system, completely unrelated to Afghanistan. Iran and Iraq have already started talking to each other, WITHOUT the U.S. present. But I guess it's really generous of us to destabilize Iran's neighbors for Iran.","snakespit","347443","Agreed. Too bad some can't see past partisan politics. Good article. As I said, we certainly created some of our own monsters to deal with. The problem that I have is far too few people realize that it wasn't simply the matter of supporting the mujahidin that did it. A lot of factors, some within our control, and many out of our control brought Bin Laden to the forefront. Which in my opinion made Russia even more of a danger to the west. I firmly believe that we were right to support their opposition at the time, even given the consequences. Sometimes the enemy of your enemy has to be your friend, even if he will become your enemy later. Generous indeed. Iran could run over Iraq in a matter or weeks, and it is doubtful if the US has the stomach for that kind of fight. A better question would be, given that Iraq wants us gone, should we come to their aid if such should come to pass. A nuclear armed Iran holding a huge majority of the world's oil could hold us over a barrel (pun intended).","bush-i-will-leave-office-my-head-held-high","05:25 AM","government-debates","27"
