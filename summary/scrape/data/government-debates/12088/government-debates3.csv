Suppose you've got family at home. Do nothing for seven minutes. Wait a whole SEVEN MINUTES and do nothing but read a kid's story about goats. Afterwards, suppose you couldn't have done anything to mitigate the situation. Would that seven minutes of doing absolutely nothing be somehow less substantial then? When Bush was told that America was under attack, he had NO IDEA OF WHAT TYPE of attack it was. Perhaps somebody had gotten control of errant Russian nukes and launched. Perhaps his assistance was needed for something. Counter-attacks authorized. HE DID NOT KNOW, and he didn't bother to try to find out. THAT is the point. THAT is why it is scary. In the above scenario, suppose your wife came out of it okay, and she knew that there was nothing you could have done. If she had asked you why you did NOTHING for seven minutes after finding out your family was in some form of danger, would you think it an adequate response to tell her ""There was nothing I could have done"". ???","bush-i-will-leave-office-my-head-held-high","04:45 PM","government-debates","34"
"03-20-2009","12088",3,"foundit, bold added by me","None","And again, you MISS THE POINT REPEATEDLY. It's not that I am saying Bush could have prevented 9-11. It is that HE NEVER EVEN TRIED to put up an adequate response to a fore-warned danger. JUST A SECOND ago you were talking about Katrina and how people didn't react to ""evacuation"" notices. Valid point against those New Orleans residents. But when BUSH WAS WARNED about bin Laden's efforts, he ALSO DID NOTHING. THAT is the point.","Ethmi","347666","I'm not wasting breath with you anymore. This is like saying ""Bush couldn't do anything, but he should've done someting!""","bush-i-will-leave-office-my-head-held-high","06:17 PM","government-debates","35"

And in a few weeks you'll be back to complain about something that happened a few months ago, insisting to other people that I'm not worth talking to as you insist that I join you in discussion on another thread... Look, I'll explain it again even though I have full faith that you will NOT be able to get it. Suppose a man's wife was in a car accident. Nearby are medical personnel who could help. They wait seven minutes, then go see what they could do. Afterwards, it is proven that there was NOTHING that these medical personnel could have done which could have saved the wife's life. But AT THE TIME, they didn't know that. All they knew was that somebody was in serious trouble, and they chose to wait seven minutes before going to respond. Suppose a man calls 911 and reports ""My house is under attack"" and the line goes dead. The operator has the caller's information from the caller ID, but does nothing for seven minutes. The operator doesn't call back. The operator doesn't dispatch police to the home address. The operator just sits there and does her nails. Afterwards, it is discovered that even if the operator had dispatched police immediately, nothing would have changed. Does that make everything all right? Just because AFTER THE FACT we can see that Bush probably couldn't have done anything himself DOES NOT address the fact that HE DID NOT EVEN TRY TO CHECK what needed to be done in an intelligibly timely manner. He did NOT EVEN ASK QUESTIONS as to the nature of the attack. He just SAT THERE and did nothing. Bush DID NOT KNOW what the situation was, beyond *America is under attack*, and he chose to SIT THERE and do nothing.","bush-i-will-leave-office-my-head-held-high","07:00 PM","government-debates","36"
