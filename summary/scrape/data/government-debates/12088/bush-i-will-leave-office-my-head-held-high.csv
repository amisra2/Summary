Bush appointed Bybee to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, at any rate, Professor Yoo opined that had Bush still been in office his administration would have planned to defend the U.S. from attacks of the sort that occurred in Mumbai. One wonders why the Bush administration failed to protect us from the attack on September 11, 2001, were they so wondrously prepared to protect America? The attack occurred on GWB's watch. The attack occurred despite countless warnings from the administration of President Clinton that such an attack could occur, that a constant watch should prevail. Bush and his people ignored all these warnings and went their merry way, vacationing and buying shoes most of the time instead of tending to the business of our nation.","bush-i-will-leave-office-my-head-held-high","02:09 PM","government-debates","6"

You're at a photo op, reading a book with schoolchildren and an aide suddenly whispers that a second plane has hit the World Trade Center. ""America is under attack."" You're the president of the United States. What do you do? There have been other moments like this in American history, when the chief executive was suddenly plunged into a crisis, but they weren't caught on videotape. George W. Bush was on camera in an elementary school in Sarasota, Fla. He could see the pagers of reporters and photographers going off, one by one. He was on the spot like few people have ever been. From two different angles, Americans have new glimpses of that historic moment. One comes from rabble-rousing Michael Moore, whose Bush-eviscerating film ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" premieres next week, and includes an uninterrupted seven-minute segment showing Bush's reaction after hearing the news of the attack. He doesn't move. Instead he continues to sit in the classroom, listening to children read aloud. Moore lets the tape roll as the minutes pass painfully by.","foundit66","346519","Do you seriously not know about what he's talking about?

Osama Bin Laden: How the U.S. helped midwife a terrorist This article details how it was a lot more than just the U.S. $$$ which was involved in energizing the bin Laden beast... Russia was falling anyways, regardless of our U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. The problems that Russia had was present in its system, completely unrelated to Afghanistan.

Too bad some can't see past partisan politics. Good article. As I said, we certainly created some of our own monsters to deal with. The problem that I have is far too few people realize that it wasn't simply the matter of supporting the mujahidin that did it. A lot of factors, some within our control, and many out of our control brought Bin Laden to the forefront. Which in my opinion made Russia even more of a danger to the west. I firmly believe that we were right to support their opposition at the time, even given the consequences. Sometimes the enemy of your enemy has to be your friend, even if he will become your enemy later. Generous indeed. Iran could run over Iraq in a matter or weeks, and it is doubtful if the US has the stomach for that kind of fight. A better question would be, given that Iraq wants us gone, should we come to their aid if such should come to pass.

The operator doesn't call back. The operator doesn't dispatch police to the home address. The operator just sits there and does her nails. Afterwards, it is discovered that even if the operator had dispatched police immediately, nothing would have changed. Does that make everything all right?
