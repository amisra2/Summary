And yet you depict these organizations as victims. You expect people to know things halfway across the US the very second they happen? Did he betray them or did they betray us? Liar or mistaken? Remember what the Army Corps of Engineers has done for them though. A mandatory evacuation isn't sufficient warning for you? Alot of people ignored the warnings. They said "" you, the levves will hold."" Lots of people died who didn't need to. The president doesn't have absoulte power (though in your dreamworld, they would, commie). Lax gun control laws are opinion based, as are environmental and healthcare policies.","bush-i-will-leave-office-my-head-held-high","01:37 PM","government-debates","4"

Although I have felt this way myself for years, even growing up as a young boy I felt that we are all being conditioned for things conciously and unconsiously, that are out of our controll sometimes, I call it Conditioned slavery (but that is another can of worms...) and that their are Evils at work in this world.....in this country..... in this very Government of ours that are out for themselves and their ""agenda"" for power, money, and controll. I like your ideas on things, resis arrest, some people would say its an opinion of a radical, but I say it is an opinion of a true free thinker that has done his homework, thinks for himself, and not what the mass media tells him to think. I wish you luck in waking people up to the real truths in this world, as I am on the same mission.

"03-08-2009","12088",1,"None","None","None","simone","346470","Recently a Professor Yoo late of the Bush administration, notable also for his authorship of the torture memos under the tutelage of Jay Bybee, George W. Bush appointed Bybee to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, at any rate, Professor Yoo opined that had Bush still been in office his administration would have planned to defend the U.S. from attacks of the sort that occurred in Mumbai. One wonders why the Bush administration failed to protect us from the attack on September 11, 2001, were they so wondrously prepared to protect America? The attack occurred on GWB's watch. The attack occurred despite countless warnings from the administration of President Clinton that such an attack could occur, that a constant watch should prevail. Bush and his people ignored all these warnings and went their merry way, vacationing and buying shoes most of the time instead of tending to the business of our nation.","bush-i-will-leave-office-my-head-held-high","02:09 PM","government-debates","6"

"03-08-2009","12088",1,"Ethmi","340230","You expect people to know things halfway across the US the very second they happen? You're at a photo op, reading a book with schoolchildren and an aide suddenly whispers that a second plane has hit the World Trade Center. ""America is under attack."" You're the president of the United States. What do you do? There have been other moments like this in American history, when the chief executive was suddenly plunged into a crisis, but they weren't caught on videotape. George W. Bush was on camera in an elementary school in Sarasota, Fla. He could see the pagers of reporters and photographers going off, one by one. He was on the spot like few people have ever been. From two different angles, Americans have new glimpses of that historic moment. One comes from rabble-rousing Michael Moore, whose Bush-eviscerating film ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" premieres next week, and includes an uninterrupted seven-minute segment showing Bush's reaction after hearing the news of the attack. He doesn't move. Instead he continues to sit in the classroom, listening to children read aloud. Moore lets the tape roll as the minutes pass painfully by.","foundit66","346519","Do you seriously not know about what he's talking about? Bush WAS TOLD that America was under attack, and he SAT THERE FOR SEVEN MINUTES DOING NOTHING. It's not an issue of him not ""knowing things halfway across the US"".

Would his running out of the room have made any difference in the outcome that day? Did those 7 minutes cost any lives, or delay our retaliation against the enemy? I don't really care for the job the man did as president, but for crying out loud...let it go.

"03-09-2009","12088",1,"isly ilwott","346505","Come now, simone. You can't really blame Bush for the attack. That's like saying you blame the police for every murder that occurs in the street because they weren't standing right there to prevent it. Quite so...as young Obama is learning in his on-the-job training program. However, the liberal to socialist to communist push is on.","simone","346579","Yes I can and I will.

Trust me, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, and W. Bush both took the blame for alot of sh t that wasn't their fault. Obama will be know different, but something tells me that he'll be smart to leave the office on his hands and knees, because something tells me that his stimulus package is a bit too much of a shopping spree, he won't have the guts to stand up to terrorist, and, if you see from my side of the isle on this particular issue (RA seems to think that only his veiwpoint exists), crime rates will rise. Oh, and Foundit, I'm still waiting to hear what lie the unscrupulous NRA plotted that was refuted by the Brady Campaign to End Gun Ownership . I remember, you kept something that essentially implied ""The NRA lied, but the heroic Brady campaign was there to educate us"", yet you always seemed so shy in specifying what that lie was that made the NRA so ""angry"" when it was refuted.","bush-i-will-leave-office-my-head-held-high","03:31 AM","government-debates","15"
