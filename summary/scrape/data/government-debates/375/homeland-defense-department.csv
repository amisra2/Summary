"03-22-2003","375",1,"None","None","None","wjim1269","5355","I think the idea is great, but unfortunately, it won't work. There is no possible way to combine all of these departments and expect to be able to increase information about potential terrorist threats. All we are doing is throwing money at a problem without actually looking for a viable alternative.","homeland-defense-department","01:21 PM","government-debates","2"

"07-01-2003","375",1,"None","None","None","American","11343","The DHS is a bunch of hogwash. It cannot be proven to be more efficent than when the different organizations were on their own, and it clearly violates (or gives the possibility of violation of) some of our Constitutional rights.","homeland-defense-department","05:32 PM","government-debates","4"

I'd much rather not trade security for freedom.","homeland-defense-department","01:55 AM","government-debates","5"

That project would pay for itself by ridding the US of illegals who get welfare and send our tax payers money back to Mexico with them.","homeland-defense-department","01:34 PM","government-debates","6"

Arrest Mexican soldiers assisting illegals in getting across the border!","AMD4EVER","11745","There has to be no better way to spend our tax money than to lock down that border. Not only with that stop the Mexicans from crossing, it may even prevent drugs and terrorists from getting through it as well. This has to be the best idea that has yet to be implemented by our government. The only reason they don't do it is because whoever does it will lose the support of our nations largest minority, the latin americans.","homeland-defense-department","11:19 PM","government-debates","8"
