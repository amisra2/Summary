But it can help in some situations (does that help?)","Matthew S","180276","Well this is exactly what the Indiana state government was trying to do with this law. The law would make it illegal for single people to use artificial means to have children. This was aimed directly at lesbians who use artificial insemination to have children.","indiana-government-gone-too-far","05:23 AM","government-debates","16"

Are there ever any circumstances when it would be justifiable for the government to deny the right to reproduce?","Matthew S","180934","We do have an inherent right to our bodies and the right to reprodution. Government interference with reproduction is never justified. I can invision a time when two sperm will be brought together to create a child and carried by a male as an ectopic pregnacy.","indiana-government-gone-too-far","02:21 PM","government-debates","19"

Hypothetically, what of someone who was currently under sentence for violent abuse of their children, should they have equal right to the same technology?","indiana-government-gone-too-far","09:21 AM","government-debates","20"

You can not reduce the freedom of certain people without reducing freedom of all.","indiana-government-gone-too-far","06:51 PM","government-debates","21"
"11-24-2005","6556",2,"None","None","None","Phunting","181219","We do reduce the freedoms already by putting such people in prison, and by taking abused children into care away from abusive parents. Surely this does not reduce the freedoms of all, why is reproduction any different?","indiana-government-gone-too-far","05:22 AM","government-debates","22"

This is why I am so against sex offender registries they reduce peoples freedoms and punshish them forever. There is never ANY justification for limiting someones freedom to reproduce. Conservates like to talk about a slipery slope well this is truely an example of a slipery slope. For today it is passing laws against single people having children tommorrow it may be only people of a certain income allowed to have children of of a certain race. Can you not see the dangers?","indiana-government-gone-too-far","07:20 AM","government-debates","23"
"11-24-2005","6556",2,"None","None","None","Phunting","181242","Of course I do. I would never support anything such as the bill that you mentioned, it is quite simply oppressive. What I do take issue with is your statement that it is never acceptable to take away the right to reproduce. I think that in the case where the courts decide there is clear enough danger to a child then they do not have that right.","indiana-government-gone-too-far","08:42 AM","government-debates","24"
"11-27-2005","6556",2,"None","None","None","Tastyfish","181876","There was a news story mentioned a couple of months back of the abortion forum which dealt with the case of a man who was ordered by court to have no more children, due to being unable to look after the previous ten or so and being in rehab. Also China is an example of reproductive rights being limited, though not taken away admitedly.","indiana-government-gone-too-far","03:03 PM","government-debates","25"

Then again, until 35 years ago the same could be said of the USA.","indiana-government-gone-too-far","05:53 PM","government-debates","26"
