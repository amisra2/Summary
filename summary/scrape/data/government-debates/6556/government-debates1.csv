The bill would states that you have to married to a person of the opposite sex and beinvolved in a faith based organization. To the conservates here; Do you think that this is a good idea? Would you really support this type of government intervention into peoples lives? I can tell you that it is this type of XXXX that is giving religious people and conservates in general a bad image.","indiana-government-gone-too-far","05:32 AM","government-debates","1"

Got so far as a referendum, and an overwhelming majority denied acces to medical assistance to single females. Could someone explain the bit about ""Women would also have to provide proof that they have participated in faith-based or church activities."" ?","indiana-government-gone-too-far","05:44 AM","government-debates","3"

A major contribution to US decline as the rest of the world enters a new century.

This type of moralistic legislation is immoral in my view and is not a good idea. By your own admission you want to impose your moral view of the world upon people who have a different and opposite moral view of the world. You say it would be a good idea for the state of Indiana to impose a reproduction ban upon single people even if those single people feel it is morally right to reproduce while being single. We have different moral views of the world and to have someone elses moral views legislated upon me is immoral. We are talking about real people with real lives not just moral opinions. Laws like these hurt real people and effect real lives","indiana-government-gone-too-far","12:00 PM","government-debates","11"
