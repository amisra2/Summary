But alas, when the Government is being run down by a bunch of educated derelicts who have no clue what type of Republic we are, I can see how the dialogue can get so distorted. It is also apparent to me that our education system has failed us massively when a sitting President and a Supreme Court Justice (more than one perhaps) find the Constitution an ""inconvenience."" It is also apparent when the citizens parrot the idiot rhetoric from the DNC that Government should work. Whenever someone makes such a laughably absurd claim, I know they haven't the first clue about our Government or the Constitution. This election is very important in that we have a clueless XXXXX currently sitting in the White House that is nothing more than an admonisher and divider. This is not leadership; it is raw ugly political partisanship on display for all to see. So with this, I thought it would be a good time to educate those who would be dumb enough to once again vote for this butt clown who infests the White House with his ignorance so that perhaps they can make a more informed decision in November. The United States is not a ""Democracy."" It is a ""Republic"" of States. With that, States have rights and our electoral system was set up in that States, not individuals, decide who the next President will be which is the reason we can elect a President even if they do not garner a majority of the popular vote. This is a good thing; it prevents larger cities and states from riding roughshod over the less populated agrarian states and gives equal representation. The genius of our founders can never be underestimated. In addition, the Federal Government was not set up so that it can work to create jobs, or housing, or welfare or any of the other well intentioned misguided leftist policies Liberals like to claim in their efforts to falsely suggest they CARE more than anyone else. The Federal Government was set up to administer our laws and defend the nation; nothing more, nothing less. The brilliance of our founders was that they set up a form of Government where it would be very difficult for it to work against the interests and LIBERTIES of its citizens. In other words, preserving our liberty was more important than ensuring Congress would ""work."" This is why we have a separation of powers through the Executive branch, Legal and Legislative branch. This is why Congress was divided between states representatives based on population and a Senate with two members from each state. The irony of the Liberals point of view is that Government is a GOOD thing; BUT only if THEIR guys are in charge. Well good luck with that Liberals. You cannot always win politically and there will always be OTHER guys in charge. Government is NOT a good thing; it is a necessary evil. Liberal Government that creates dependency on Government is the worst form of Government because it erodes your liberties and choices. I cannot imagine why anyone would argue we need MORE Government or that creating a dependent class of citizens to the Federal Government is a ""good"" idea. Todays debates center around the class envy claim that the Rich do not pay their fair share and that the only equitable way to solve this is to permit the Government more power to steal the wealth at the threat of a gun and re-distribute it the way the current politicians in power deem to be fair. I cannot fathom a more laughably dumb argument. History is littered with the failures of well-intentioned Liberal policies. It is also littered with the economic failures of those policies. We didn't enter a serious recession because the rich have too much wealth; we entered it because the Government attempts to manage wealth and the economy. But alas, Government cannot even manage its own budget or even pass one for that matter; how can one actually argue it can manage something as complex as the US economy? So get the facts, learn your history and let's get rid of this idiot before he buries us in another $5 trillion debt and massive trillion dollar deficits with his divisive laughably ignorant rhetoric.

Once again the tired and old leftist BS that it is all Bushs fault. Even four years later after the leftists on the Democrat side of the aisle passed every liberal leftist agenda they desperately love, it is still Bushs fault. It is apparent that you couldnt read, comprehend or interpret factual data if it slapped you upside your thick uniformed skull. The reason the debt has been mounting under Democrats and Democrat leadership is because they couldnt find a spending program they didnt like. On top of this, they couldnt pass a budget while they held a majority in BOTH houses of Congress and instead went on a spending binge passing their beloved health care program, their beloved $trillion stimulus package along party lines and yet here you go spewing your uninformed bile that it is all about war spending. Rather than troll this forum with your abject ineffectual BS, why not provide some FACTS to support your hysterics. I wont hold my breath however; you have shown a profound disregard for facts, truth and honesty in your desperate attempts to defend the indefensible and this idiot of a President. Coming from you this comment is laughably ironic. You have never posted a fact to support your emotional hysterics nor would you be able to find any. But I will gladly wait while you desperately search the internet for something, anything, which will remotely support your laughably dumb assertions here. Another laughably ironic comment coming from someone who so obviously avoids the truth as to make false laughably uninformed claims about things they know nothing about. As I stated earlier, if you want to bring some facts to support your emotional hysterics, I am prepared to debate them. Otherwise, this is more of the same ineffectual blather you are known for on this forum containing nothing more substantive than because you say so. I am quite certain that uniformed leftists like you will continue blaming Bush on into the 22nd century. Facts have no bearing on such massive disregard for facts or the truth. The irony here is that you think you could recognize the facts or truth if they walked up an introduced themselves to you. But here are some FACTS; the deficit prior to Americans being duped into voting in Democrats as a majority in the House and Senate was at $161 billion. By the time Americans realized what a massive mistake that was; the deficit had ballooned to over $1 trillion. Look at the actual data yourself; or do you prefer making up your own tables? Historical Tables | The White House FACT: Bush didnt cause the implosion of the housing market; that was the work of previous administrations, congress and the Federal Governments well-meaning liberal efforts to reduce the credit requirements of those who wanted to buy homes and then when confronted with the massive looming foreclosure rates; claimed that the Republicans on the House Committees trying to do something about them were engaging in racism. Dont believe me; here is the video, pay special attention to what Democrats like Maxine Waters says about Frankin Raines who corrupted the agency and profited from his mismanagement of the agency: Senate Committee Hearings on Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac 2004 - YouTube You would be wrong again; but at least you are consistent. We are paying for the economic lies of this Administration, the Democrats who have spent us into an additional $5 trillion in debt and $1.3 trillion deficits as far as the eye can see with NOTHING to show for it in return. Yes, it is always convenient for Liberals to ignore the facts, realities and truth; but for many, these things are as obvious as the growing nose liberals faces as they lie, divert, distort and obfuscate the truth. The notion that we can sustain four more years of these butt clowns who have wasted billions in taxpayer money on green energy initiatives, allowed the deaths of thousands in the gun running to Mexican drug cartels, and who show such disdain for our Constitution defies good common sense. Obama is a failure; his signature legislation will be stricken down as unconstitutional and his other massive spending legislation the pork laden stimulus bill has done nothing but bury generations in massive debt while doing NOTHING to improve the economy. This administration is so retarded that it now wants to double down with porkulus II claiming that a massive $500 billion program will do what the $trillion program couldnt. Of course anyone with half a brain can see through such idiotic nonsense; that is except those who still desperately cling to hopey changey and this idiot of a President whose experience is tantamount to a Jr. Senator from the outback. Like I said, November cannot get here soon enough. The faster we send the XXXXXX infesting this Government with the inane divisive bile filled rhetoric, the better.","entitlement-mentality","04:27 PM","government-debates","3"
"04-28-2012","16355",1,"Freedom","452997","No it is not, states are no more moral than individuals and are themselves of arbitrary size and composition. How can you say at once that something gives equal representation and it is not democratic? It's an oxymoron, equal representation would be each vote counts for the same, not city votes count for less because they happened to crowd into one state. I have to hope that a better understanding exists and can be applied because the genius of our founders allowed the civil war and every violation of rights before and after it up till this very day, and is the form of the government you are attacking right now. They did everything except define those liberties in such language that there could be no legal reinterpretation. I would have traded all the 'checks and balances' for one absolute statement of moral truth. The constitution is a manual and it has not protected our rights in the one way it needed to, from the laws of the government. Ah ha, Brutus said that this view was not normal among the right, I think it is. Perhaps the founders were so enlightened they couldn't either because they placed no protection from it in our constitution. The truth is madman such as Obama (but in congress) are spending money they don't have taking out loans on authority they were not given. You cannot lay the debt on Bush because if Bush's finances were bad that only heightens the responsibility not to spend more money, this past government has.","Truth Detector","453794","Originally Posted by Truth Detector The United States is not a ""Democracy.""

Apparently your version of liberty is incredibly different from the dictionary version that many of us do comprehend. Liberty does not come from Government; it comes from being free from Government. The reason for the checks and balances and the separation of powers contained in the Constitution was based on the KNOWLEDGE and experience that a powerful central Government can and will usurp liberties and enslave the citizens. By creating a REPUBLIC and not a straight democracy, and limiting the role of central Government to defense and administering our laws, the genius of our founders can truly be seen. Unfortunately, and because many are products of our failed educational institutions dominated by liberal politics, many like you ignorantly believe that Government can provide safety and liberty and therefore support XXXXXX like those running the DNC and this putz of a President who wouldnt know what leadership is if it slapped him upside his uniformed arrogant and demonstrably thick head.

I cannot fathom a more laughably dumb argument. This statement makes little sense; but then it is consistent with many of your weak retorts. Something we are in total agreement on. The irony for Liberals is that when Bush ran up a deficit which at its height amounted to a mere $400 billion they were having conniptions. But now with their guys in charge, spending this great nation into a mountain of debt and $1.3 trillion deficits is somehow a good thing. But here is a FACT; before Americans were duped into voting into power Democrats in 2008, the deficit had been managed down to about $170 billion. Democrats promised Americans fiscal restraint and deficit containment; they lied. This is typical with Democrats who count on the uninformed to keep them elected and hope that Americans have the memory of a lemming so that they cannot be held accountable for the lies, distortions and deflections and continue to promise Americans something for nothing by further eroding their liberties and making them willing dependent wards of the State and permanent voting blocks.","entitlement-mentality","01:49 PM","government-debates","5"

Carry on. I am quite certain that the irony of your rhetoric escapes you. Yes lets take a look at it. Once again you would be wrong; but at least you are consistent. The laughable claim that the budget deficits recorded for the record did not contain the war spending is a lie. Bushs deficits amounted to about $400 billion; Obamas are in the $1.3 trillion. BIG difference; but again, the irony of being Liberal is to wallow in ignorance and hypocrisy of how the deficits are created and believe that massive deficit spending is okay, but only if YOUR guys are spending it right? I suggest that you come up with something a little more substantive than because you say so in these debates. It truly is a waste of time to debate someone so lacking in even basic facts. I am quite certain the irony of this remark also escapes you. I have yet to see anything remotely linked to the truth coming from you. Most of your comments are OPINIONS based on nothing more substantive than parroting DNC talking points or because you say so. REALLY? Okay tell me how much Obama has spent on the war since he took office. REALLY? Okay tell us how much contractors are profiteering from the war and how this has never occurred and still not occurring under Obama. By the way, this wasnt Bushs war; that is a laughably ignorant partisan claim that avoids the reality and truth which you have shown an incredible propensity for. It was OUR war voting for by BOTH parties with high public approval ratings. Because you are gullible like many Americans who follow the mainstream media, you are now trying to re-write the historic record to fit a narrow myopic political agenda. Nothing here but false claims; but who would ever accuse you of having any facts right? You are truly comedic in your diatribes about Bush. I am hardly surprised that even after Democrats and Liberals got their majorities in Congress to pass all their beloved social welfare programs and supposed stimulus that after they are shown to be a massive failure and buried us in massive additional debt and deficits they would still be desperately blaming Bush for their failure. But then, you epitomize the type of voter that Obama needs to stay elected; uninformed, gullible, factually challenged and economically ignorant. Here is a great interview of Obama voters as they went to the polls: How Obama Got Elected...

You are unaware of my education, it is inappropriate to draw conclusions from it even if you did. The civil war was about slavery, slavery was not dealt with because not absolute statement of rights exists in Now it's my turn to say you haven't read the constitution. This government is not violating the constitution. Factual substance? Taxation, regulation and the social engineering that the governments both federal and state participate in. Violations of liberty, not unconstitutional. Done. If you think it protects us and it only isn't because people are ignoring it then let's discuss some examples. Congress chooses to establish a 90% federal income tax for anyone who earns more than 10,000 above median wage. They also establish a program which will supplement any wage up to 10,0000 below median wage. As you well know if you don't pay income taxes they will drain your bank accounts and eventually start confiscating your property and selling it. What in the constitution prevents this? and from private criminals as well, so how could any constitution establish that the government should not behave criminally when it does not define what liberty is and declare it inviolate even to the government? Recognizing Well this government is usurping liberties and enslaving citizens, so we need a plan C. If it cannot provide safety by protecting liberty what use is it? Yes So you are saying that the budget plans when Bush went out would have reduced the deficit to 170 billion?","entitlement-mentality","06:33 PM","government-debates","7"
