Its basically a simulation of the federal government and it is growing and developing to become something very interesting. We need people who are interested in serving as Libertarian senators. NOTE: You need not be a Libertarian in real life. We have all types of people, and the only thing we ALL have in common is an intense interest in individual liberty and smaller government. This is a fun way of putting out your political opinion. Any of your ideas we pass will be signed by all who support it and passed along to our real legislators in the Congress to give them an idea of how you and the majority of our group think the important issues of our day should be handled by Congress. We will fill a 100 seat Senate and also have opportunities in the executive and judiciary branches. So if you like politics and current events you will find this political simulation a fun way to express your political opinion and send it to the Congress if you want with the support of others who share your opinion. You can be as involved as much as you want or have time for. To join, sign up for the main group here: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/usma_ and the Libertarian Caucus here: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/usma_lc From there we can answer any questions you have and help you get a seat in the Senate. We need all the freedom-loving people we can get to help further our cause. This simulation has proven very educational for me, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in sorting out their own political views, as well as people who have solid views and want to debate.","libertarians-similar-needed-political-simulation","10:50 PM","government-debates","1"
