I like Nader, too, but I think everyone has to admit that had he not ran in the last election, Gore would have won. And, obviously, I think that it is not debateable that essentially all of the people that voted for Nader would rather have Gore as president than Bush. I am not telling people how they should vote, but I at least think that they have to be realistic that votinng for Nader instead of Kerry will help Bush.","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","03:52 PM","government-debates","3"

I do acknowledge that he is polling high, which could potenially be scary for Demorcrats. Personally, I do believe that people are scared and angy enough over the last election that they will rally behind Kerry at the end. Also, I am not sure that he will not endorse Kerry in the end, anyway. If this is what he is going to do, I think that it is great that he is running, as it does give him a chance to put his ideas in the spotlight, and to keep the Democrats left.","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","03:57 PM","government-debates","4"

The thing that Bush has over Kerry is his honesty and his willingness to do what he says he will do. Kerry? That guy is all over the place. Check out www.gop.com (I know that it's the Republican website, but it does include the sources for its information if you want to double check it). They have a ""Kerry v Kerry"" boxing game in which you go through 50 rounds of Kerry flip-flopping on issues.

I am actually a fan of the run-off system used by France. Many people run, and then the top two candidates participate in a run-off at a later date (unless the top one already has a majority, in which case they are declared elected.) However, in the absence of such a system, I think that the two-party system is best. Voters have a choice, but yet there are not so many choices that the winner has little support.","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","10:08 PM","government-debates","11"
"03-13-2004","1927",1,"wjim1269","None","Do you really think that there is no difference between Bush and Kerry? His speech Friday further positioned Mr. Kerry for a serious challenge to the incumbent. He denied that as president he would allow allies to inhibit America's defense ( ""I will not wait for a green light from abroad when our safety is at stake"" ) or that he would return to a law-enforcement-only approach to fighting terrorism ( ""I will not hesitate to order direct military action"" ). He warned that the war on terror ""isn't just a manhunt. . . . We face a global jihadist movement of many groups . . . all committed to assaulting the United States and free and open societies around the globe. "" He promised a larger Army, a renewed commitment to the antiproliferation efforts of former senator Sam Nunn and Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) and increased support for human rights and democracy-building in Islamic countries . He promised better cooperation with allies, more aid for Afghanistan and more attention to homeland defense .","fracas","39467","Washington Post seems many of these things have already been done by Bush unilateralism continue the war on terror larger army democracy building in the ME homeland defense he also supports a constitutional (in Massachusett) amendment against gay marriage and believes in free trade ofcourse with Kerry it is hard to say what he actually believes in or intend to do","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","10:54 PM","government-debates","12"

"03-22-2004","1927",1,"None","None","None","Ghost","40518","Kerry says he'll build a larger army...so why did he vote against the M1 Abrams, the M2 Bradley, the Patriot missile, Trident subs, the F-15, the F-16, the stealth aircraft, and about a dozen other programs? We don't need a bigger army, we need a faster, leaner, deadlier army, which is EXACTLY what the Bush admin (Rumsfeld, namely) is going for. He voted against $87 billion to be used to fund our soldiers in combat areas, including body and vehicle armor (well, he did vote for it, before he voted against it...whatever that means). He's in favor of human rights and democracies in Islamic countries, but then bitches at Bush for putting muscle into doing both of these things. Thing is, Kerry shouldn't win. He has no set plans for this country, you can't trust him in the least, and what he has voted for and against in the Senate makes me genuinely frightened that this idiot has the potential to be the president for 4 years...and if he picked Hillary Clinton as his running mate?!?!?!?!","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","06:56 PM","government-debates","15"
