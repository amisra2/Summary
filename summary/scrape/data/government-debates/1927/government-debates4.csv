Not to mention he is dumber than a pile of hammers. Pity Kerry is such a blah - but I suspect we will at least have a better cabinet - one without Rumsfeld! I am still seriously considering a vote for Mickey Mouse. But seriously, Bush is the commander of a military that utilizes humiliation and torture. To vote him into office again sends a seriously flawed message to the entire world.","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","12:22 PM","government-debates","49"
"05-09-2004","1927",4,"None","None","None","CCR1994","48715","It looks as though the public at large is prepared to send a message to the Democrats unless they shape up. Part of that constituency is backing Nader's candidacy out of conscience and that is admirable. I would like to think that the Democrats are going to learn something from these voters instead of lecturing them or writing them off. No vote is ever wasted if the powers that be get the message and institute the changes necessary to win back their confidence.","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","03:48 PM","government-debates","50"

Neither Kerry nor Bush are worthy of leading this country. Now McCain or Edwards, that's a different story.

There's a bell shaped curve of good and bad people of every origin. You have a simplistic approach to judging people's worth. There are many good American citizens of Arabic descent. I'm not for Nader at all, but your reasoning is narrow minded and racist.","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","11:02 AM","government-debates","55"

Sadam had nothing to do with 9/11. He was not honest with the country. He played on our fears to get our support for going to iraq. And they knew there were no weapons before they got there.

Nadar doesn't care about repubs or democrats winning or losing, he thinks the american people lose either way, so it's irrelevant to his position. I like that stance. That being said, I don't like a lot of his platform issues so he won't get my vote this election. -mach","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","11:07 PM","government-debates","59"
