"03-23-2004","1927",2,"shooting_star24","None","I am very upset that in a recent poll led by the Today Show, 8% of the people polled claimed they would vote for Nader for President. Now, I'm not saying I don't think Nader's a good guy and everything, but by voting for Nader, you are taking a vote away from Kerry which will help Bush to get back into office. Bush has done terrible things while in office that many refuse to see. Please do not vote Nader. Nader has no chance of winning the presidency. It's clear you must vote for Kerry. (or Bush if your dumb)","sundowner","40688","First off, don't tell people how they should be voting. It is not your place. Let the candidates speak for themselves. You say that voting for Nader is wasting your vote. I disagree. Voting other than your conscience is wasting your vote. If everyone said ""well geez, if my guy doesn't win I am just wasting my vote, I guess I better vote for the guy that is ahead in the polls"", one candidate would get 100% of the vote. Sadly, there are many who think like you out there, and while they really like Nader's stance on the issues better, they will vote for Kerry or Bush simply because they don't think Nader can win. And what terrible things has Bush done in office? Personally, I have never voted for the simple fact that there has not been a candidate yet since I have been 18y/o that I would be able to say I am proud that I helped elect to the white house. If one comes along, I will vote. If I elect some crook who screws up the country, would I not partially be to blame? I think Bush is doing an OK job with the hand that was dealt to him. I certainly don't think from what I have seen of him that Kerry could have done any better, nor even come close to handeling things as well as Bush. Bush can at least make up his mind on the issues, Kerry trys to play both sides of the record at the same time. Personally, I think Edwards would have done a better job than both of them, I guess we will have to wait another 4 years or so to find out.","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","02:25 PM","government-debates","16"

If everyone bites the bullet and votes how they should, someone like Nader, or even a write-in like Clark could come out ahead. The American people just have to awaken to their rights and realize that they do NOT have to vote for a party. The founding fathers didn't want political parties, and for a good reason because they do nothing but bad. They encourage people to vote for the people that are on the ticket and have the big names. People that really want their favorite to win should vote write-in, and we should completely eliminate the big parties. All voting should be write-in in my personal opinion. This would encourage better voting.","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","11:48 AM","government-debates","17"

"03-24-2004","1927",2,"daewoo","None","I think you should vote your conscience. Personally, I plan to vote for a third part canidate this time around. As long as we all keep voting for special interrest whores, that is all we are going to get (and yes, kerry is just as much of a whore to special interests as bush).","hvozdany","40858","I agree with you that essentially every politician is beholden to special interests because of the amount of money in politics. To me, the most important issue in government is not the Iraq war, or the economy, it should be campaign finance reform. Even if a candidate did not want to take special interest money, because of the amount of money needed to win a campaign, they are almost forced to. I don't think that there is a simple answer to take the money out of politics, but I believe a real effort must be made. This, I believe, is the one thing that has the most potential to improve our government. I also agree with you that I woiuld love to see a viable third party candidate. I was not old enough to vote for Perot, but I probably would have. I would like to vote for Nader, but I know realisticly what this vote does. If there were a moderate Republican in office, I would consider 'voting my conscience' but Bush scares me so much that I feel, unfortunately, the most important thing is to get him out of office.","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","01:27 PM","government-debates","21"

There seems to be an assumption that every more liberal person out there likes Nader more than Kerry. The fact is, a lot more people would vote for Kerry over Nader even if they weren't voting based on who they think could win. Also, realistically, to win you have to raise a lot of money. The parties give the framework to do this, making a third party bid almost impossible.","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","01:35 PM","government-debates","22"
"03-25-2004","1927",2,"None","None","None","Ghost","40953","I agree, people should vote for who they agree with most, or who they think will do the best job. I was talking to a woman at work today, and the conversation scared me. I asked her who she will vote for. Her reply was ""whoever the Democrats pick. I'm not Republican, not even remotely so."" I said ""you don't like Bush?"" Her reply ""well, I don't think he's that bad really, I just don't think that a president has much real power and I'm not Republican."" I told her about little things like the president's ability to put troops into combat for up to 90 days, and she'd never heard of it before. I tried to ask her about her take on Clarke's new book, and she didn't know what it was. The thing that scares me is that people are ignorant of the political processes in this country and ignorant of the candidates, and yet they still vote. They just vote along with party lines. Another thing that worries me in this upcoming election is that so many Bush-haters are going to vote for anyone as long as it's not Bush. I wouldn't be surprised if the Democratic nomination went to a chimpanzee named ""Bobo"" and liberals turned out in droves to vote for the damn monkey just because he isn't George Bush. And the funny thing is that the vast majority of these people can't come up with any coherent reason why they vote against Bush, they just have this unfounded hatred of him. From my point of view, it's absolutley wonderful that Nader is running and has 8% of the vote. That means that a good amount of (need to avoid describing them as something offensive...) people will change what would have otherwise been a vote for Kerry into essentially a squandered vote. It's kinda like just chopping off nearly 8% of Kerry's numbers in the polls. Thank God for liberal independents.","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","03:01 AM","government-debates","23"
"03-26-2004","1927",2,"None","None","None","Ghost","41131","No, I don't think it's contradictory. I do believe people should vote their conscience. I also believe that with only 8% of the vote currently going to Nader, it's quite obvious he won't win. The options for who will be president are down to Bush and Kerry. Now, if you vote for Nader, you're not voting for one of the two viable candidates...which is kinda like squandering. Don't get me wrong; if you believe that Nader would be the best president, go vote for him. Campaign for him. Wow, no, I don't work for Kerry. God no. Besides, I actually mean what I say.","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","01:56 AM","government-debates","25"
"03-26-2004","1927",2,"None","None","None","hvozdany","41232","I also think another factor in people's decision (mine at least) is that there is a very right wing president in office right now, and the Republicans control both houses of congress. If there were a moderate Republican as president, or the congress was controlled by the Democrats, I think that perhaps I would be more likely to vote for Nader, even if it was throwing my vote away.","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","06:21 PM","government-debates","27"
