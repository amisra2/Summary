He's also screwed up in what he thinks about taxes. Kerry proposed a nasty tax on gas, social security, and a lot of other things. Just because the government has more money doesn't mean we'll be better off. You've got to be stupid if you think the government is going to solve all of our problems. Nader's case: If Nader gets elected, he'll probably outlaw turbojets and other ""fuel consuming"" devices. [sarcasm]Oooohh! Nature! Let's put it before mankind![/sarcasm] If you are for Nader or Kerry, you are clearly out of your real mind.","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","10:43 AM","government-debates","31"
"03-30-2004","1927",3,"Nallyo","None","He is supporting domestic programs, something that is not very conservative. Conservatives generally hold the belief that people can make it if they work hard enough. Liberals swamp the populace in social programs. Also, the whole naturalization of illegal immigrants got under the collar of some pretty big conservatives.","hvozdany","41683","What 'domestic issues' is he supporting? ...I do agree that there are two things that you could point to and say that he is moderate...spending a whole lot, and chainging immigration policy. Although, realistically, the immigration policy change is an effort to get Hispanic votes. Does anyone think his proposal is going to really effect immigration? And can anyone honestly say he is moderate? Why do you think that liberals dislike him so much? He NEVER supports the environment, is very supportive of corporations, believes in huge tax cuts, he is anti gay rights (to the point of a constitutinal amendment!!) anti affirmative action, anti abortion, anti workers rights, he skews the line between church and state, the list goes on and on....pandering to latinos and not caring what the government spends or what the federal deficit is does not make him a moderate in my book... ....that does in yours?","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","02:35 PM","government-debates","32"
"03-30-2004","1927",3,"shooting_star24","None","I am very upset that in a recent poll led by the Today Show, 8% of the people polled claimed they would vote for Nader for President. Now, I'm not saying I don't think Nader's a good guy and everything, but by voting for Nader, you are taking a vote away from Kerry which will help Bush to get back into office. Bush has done terrible things while in office that many refuse to see. Please do not vote Nader. Nader has no chance of winning the presidency. It's clear you must vote for Kerry. (or Bush if your dumb)","jim's trucking","41719","you're Your sense of recognition of dumbness has apparently diminished recently. What makes you think that everybody who votes for Nader would have voted for Kerry. They may have better sense than that! They may actually cause Kerry to lose by fewer votes! Nader does have a chance of winning. I have a chance of winning the lottery, too. If not Nader, then vote for George Bush, or Mickey Mouse, or Ross Peroit, or J. Fred Muggs. ANYBODY BUT KERRY! JMHO, but John French Kerry is one of the most dishonest politicians I have ever heard talk!","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","05:38 PM","government-debates","33"

I'll gladly pay my taxes, I think it's my patriotic duty, but don't take my money and then give it out to lazy slobs who won't work so we support them. And yeah, he is anti-affirmative action and anti-abortion...more reason I'll vote for him. The liberal point of view on these two topics is sheer idiocy and harmful.

"04-07-2004","1927",3,"sundowner","None","First off, don't tell people how they should be voting. It is not your place. Let the candidates speak for themselves. You say that voting for Nader is wasting your vote. I disagree. Voting other than your conscience is wasting your vote. If everyone said ""well geez, if my guy doesn't win I am just wasting my vote, I guess I better vote for the guy that is ahead in the polls"", one candidate would get 100% of the vote. Sadly, there are many who think like you out there, and while they really like Nader's stance on the issues better, they will vote for Kerry or Bush simply because they don't think Nader can win. And what terrible things has Bush done in office? Personally, I have never voted for the simple fact that there has not been a candidate yet since I have been 18y/o that I would be able to say I am proud that I helped elect to the white house. If one comes along, I will vote. If I elect some crook who screws up the country, would I not partially be to blame? I think Bush is doing an OK job with the hand that was dealt to him. I certainly don't think from what I have seen of him that Kerry could have done any better, nor even come close to handeling things as well as Bush. Bush can at least make up his mind on the issues, Kerry trys to play both sides of the record at the same time. Personally, I think Edwards would have done a better job than both of them, I guess we will have to wait another 4 years or so to find out.","shooting_star24","42901","Um, sorry I haven't been here to stick up for myself in a while. Vacation. Now, okay, I still stand strong with the fact that voting for Nader would be the wrong choice. And no I don't think that the person should vote for whomever is at the top of the poll, just not the 8% person who really has no chance of winning. And I'm sorry that I was 'telling' people who to vote for, I guess it should have been more like a suggestion. And I am sorry that I did not include a source of all the terrible things I believe Bush has done so...eh...I don't quite know how to add a source so bear with me here.. http://politicalhumor.about.com/libr...bushresume.htm Well, yeah, that's all. And well, I'm only 13 so I don't have my opinions quite straight yet. But, don't even start on me about whether my parents influence me. I think different opinions than my parents.","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","07:00 PM","government-debates","35"
"04-08-2004","1927",3,"sundowner","None","I still do not see the distinction. My point about this was that probably far too many people really want to vote for Nader, but since they continuously hear from the news media that he cannot win and their vote will be wasted, they vote for either the demo or repub. I think that everyone who really liked Nader and deep down wanteed to vote for him did...he would be a real factor in the election. It will happen one day or another, that an independent candidate comes along that sweeps an election away from the big 2 parties, I can't wait to see it.","Dmann","43016","that's it ...I've been saying this for years now. right on kid.","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","03:00 AM","government-debates","36"

"04-10-2004","1927",3,"None","None","None","Dmann","43367","MESSAGE TO AMERICA'S STUDENTS FROM RALPH NADER Nader: The War, The Draft, Your Future We have been down this road before. U.S. troops sent to war half a world away. American foreign policy controlled by an arrogant elite, bent on projecting military power around the globe. A public misled into supporting an unconstitutional war founded on deceit and fabrications. As the death toll mounts, we hear claims that the war is nearly won, that victory is just around the corner. But victory never arrives. As the public loses confidence in the government, the government questions the patriotism of any who express doubt about the war. When a presidential election arrives, both the Democrat and Republican nominees embrace the policy of continued war. The military draft comes to dominate the lives of America's young, and vast numbers who believe the war to be a senseless blunder are faced with fighting a war they do not believe in, or facing exile or prison. The year was 1968. Because voters had no choice that November, the Vietnam War continued for another six years. Hundreds of thousands of Americans like you died, were maimed, or suffered from diseases like malaria. A far greater number of Vietnamese died. Today, the war is in the quicksands and alleys of Iraq. Once again, under the pressure of a determined resistance, we see an American war policy being slowly torn apart at the seams, while the candidates urge us to ""stay the course"" in this tragic misadventure. Today's Presidential candidates are not Nixon and Humphrey, they are now Bush and Kerry. Once again, there is one overriding truth: If war is the only choice in this election, then war we will have. Today enlistments in the Reserves and National Guard are declining. The Pentagon is quietly recruiting new members to fill local draft boards, as the machinery for drafting a new generation of young Americans is being quietly put into place. Young Americans need to know that a train is coming, and it could run over their generation in the same way that the Vietnam War devastated the lives of those who came of age in the sixties. I am running for President, and have been against this war from the beginning. We must not waste lives in order to control and waste more oil. Stand with us and we may yet salvage your future and Americas' future from this looming disaster. - Ralph Nader","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","06:49 PM","government-debates","38"

It was not unconstitutional, not matter what anyone says. He could have even sent a 3 month occupation force, done what he wanted and pulled them hom and still be constitutional. Congress voted and authorized any wars that would be needed to fight in the name of terrorism, they got it. Maybe he should take some of his own words on deceit, seeing as he is either outright lying or has no idea what he's talking about. We still don't know what the intentions of the administration were over there or not, and won't for years. For all we know, there could be WMDs buried out in the middle of nowhere. I doubt we've had the time to cover every squarefoot of Iraqi land. shooting_star24, using a political humor site as a reference isn't exactly credible.","dont-vote-nader-2004-a","02:17 AM","government-debates","39"
