The problem was not that the education was unavailable or unaffordable but that folks were not getting the right degrees. As a senior scientist at a large engineering firm I have some perspective on this field. Yes, we had more openings for engineers than we could fill, but we were not drawing from overseas. Moreover, the salaries we were offering to entry level civil, mechanical, and structural engineers would more than pay off that degree investment. Indeed, the shortage you describe actually INCREASES the wage that a qualified entry level candidate commands. This is good news, not bad. Kids, get your CE degree today! As to the question of medical education - who would want to chart a course through 6 years of medical school with the knowledge that our nation is contemplating a revamping of the whole medical field? I think that the medical and technical fields should be regarded separately as I believe the uncertainty surrounding medicine has a political component to it. I would not suggest that we are importing medical personnel as I doubt they arrive en masse in cattle cars. No, these professionals choose to come here for a reason: Opportunity for financial and professional gain. We should celebrate the fact that Doctors from around the world want to practice here, not consider it a problem. As a side note: Since that report came out my salary has increased 105%. Just thought I would add that little bit o' trivia for those wondering if the degree was worthwhile...","americans-enjoy-least-opportunities","08:21 PM","government-debates","18"

As far as medicine, No candidate is arguing a change in the institution. Though they should; Medicine is a science controlled by states and counties; Think about that. A Pilot has a federal license and the person is expected to stay current before he can fly or carry passengers. A Doctor is licensed by a state and his actions are governed by local protocols. In Colorado, a doctor or nurse only has to pay for a yearly license to practice medicine on you. Their Protocols for treating a heart attack is different from Michigan and less effective, but the doctor is bound by local controlling interests which are at times, not even in the medical field, as in Colorado. Without any CEU requirements, a doctor or nurse can wake up from a 5 year comma without any knowledge of medicine and work on you and your family. A Nurse licensed in Nevada is not a nurse in Florida. Your argument that people are forgoing medical training because the federal government might have an effect on income is reaching at best. We are importing medical people at an alarming rate here in Nevada; we get them from the Philippines. This is an effective way to control the salaries of nurses who have to pay the highest in medical insurance and pay to keep their license current by yearly education that never ends. Medical institutions are the ones that have to absorb the populations lack of insurance. Your argument that throwing money at medicine will harm it is incredibly weak. Money means they can get the best devices and increase salaries, not lower them. The company you work for gets paid for its services and you gain some benefit from that. Hospitals have to play a game of cutting everywhere just to keep the doors open for all the free rides they alone have to face. We support oil companies by pushing 10s of billions at them and even give public land to the cause. Yet, suddenly supporting medicine is far too socialistic for the hard right. Its beyond hypocritical to feed one company and starve another. Everyone argues that hospitals must take sick people, but when it comes to sharing in the burden, thats simply to far. The socialized institutions we have seem to do very well. Exxon is clearly in the black. Lets get medicine in the black and cut down on all those operations that could have been avoided by simply having the money for the new scanner.","americans-enjoy-least-opportunities","09:42 AM","government-debates","19"
"09-20-2007","10341",2,"None","None","None","E Mutz","284719","Washington times. 2005 ??? Your citation lists a report dated 2004. The problem is not a shortage of scientists and engineers in the United States, but rather how the country is importing scientists and doctoral candidates from elsewhere to create an unattractive glut of low-income, low-prospect career paths, which native-born Americans are increasingly avoiding. Again, we are not importing human flesh as if it were a commodity. We are the free market that these individuals wish to belong to. We do not go calling, they come to us. Cite one study to indicate how this imported flesh has resulted in decreasing salaries for Doctors or Scientists. All I can find is study after study that shows how salaries are going up in these fields. As far as medicine, No candidate is arguing a change in the institution. Though they should; Medicine is a science controlled by states and counties; Think about that. A Pilot has a federal license and the person is expected to stay current before he can fly or carry passengers. A Doctor is licensed by a state and his actions are governed by local protocols.

Without any CEU requirements, a doctor or nurse can wake up from a 5 year comma without any knowledge of medicine and work on you and your family. A Nurse licensed in Nevada is not a nurse in Florida. The pilot is licensed federally because it is rather the nature of his business to conduct interstate travel. Medicine is no more controlled by the State than any other licensed profession is controlled by the state. Engineers, Geologists, Teachers, Plumbers, etc are all licensed by the State. This is not new and not sinister. The State of Colorado has no continuing education credit requirement. In fact, 10 states have no such requirement; however, 40 States do. You may peruse this list at: http://cme.mc.duke.edu/wysiwyg/downl...-06%5B1%5D.pdf You will note that your State of Nevada requires 40 hours of continuing ed in ""specialty, ethics, and bioterrorism"". How is this subservient to the ""State's controlling interest? You will note that several states require as much as 200 credits for relicensure. I am afraid the example you cited is clearly not typical. Your argument that people are forgoing medical training because the federal government might have an effect on income is reaching at best. We are importing medical people at an alarming rate here in Nevada; we get them from the Philippines. This is an effective way to control the salaries of nurses who have to pay the highest in medical insurance and pay to keep their license current by yearly education that never ends. But....you just said that there was no education requirement... Now there is and it is endless...Which is it Senator? But let us assume worst case scenario. Since you seem to regard Filipinos to be the agents of economic apocalypse, let us assume that a Filipino gets a degree in an inexpensive school in the middle of the Jungle. Now suppose that fellow bobs about on a cork raft until he lands on the shores of California. He staggers to the State Licensing board where he meets all the requirements to practice medicine. Pray tell me sir, what is the problem? Medical institutions are the ones that have to absorb the populations lack of insurance. Your argument that throwing money at medicine will harm it is incredibly weak. Money means they can get the best devices and increase salaries, not lower them. The company you work for gets paid for its services and you gain some benefit from that.

The socialized institutions we have seem to do very well. Exxon is clearly in the black. Lets get medicine in the black and cut down on all those operations that could have been avoided by simply having the money for the new scanner. I have no idea what this was all about as I never argued ""that throwing money at medicine will harm it."" If you are going to invent arguments to be opposed to, use some creativity. Say that I advocated shaving birds or claimed that OJ Simpson was responsible for Global Warming. I do like how you irrelevently tied ""Big oil"" into the argument to achieve a talking points bingo.
