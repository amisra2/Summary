That doesn't include security people, who command much higher wages, just the dishwashers, truck drivers, etc. Actual numbers are, of course, classified.","does-really-cost-much","10:28 AM","government-debates","4"

"06-13-2006","8005",1,"emclean","None","moving the people is the easy part, moving the arms rooms (valts) for 10,000 - 15,000 weapons (personal weapons for every parson, side arms, heavy weapons, my guess might be low), other secure storage for comm. equipment (an sceond valt), repair fecilites for all the equipment (yes there are existing ones, for the exisiting units), secure storage for there DRB, more buildings for every thing from moterpools, to MWR sights. then there is the cost of cleaning up the old bace, the milatary has a tendancy to be rough on the local enviroment.","snakespit","216609","You should go to work for the GAO. First off, they are not going to ""move"" all of their buildings. They will leave them in place, or tear them down. Most of the stuff that they will move will probably be moved by MAC anyway, so it will not be bid out to civilian contractors. We are only talking about moving 8000 Marines and their gear, anyone who honestly thinks this calls for 10.3 billion dollars is seriously deluded.","does-really-cost-much","01:21 AM","government-debates","9"

As for the 10.3 billion to relocate them....you really cant' say it is high or low without knowing what exactly they are doing.","does-really-cost-much","07:28 AM","government-debates","10"

Do they have a base on Guam for these Marines and their families yet? Do you know how much military gear is going with them? You really went to travelocity to get your figure? Really????","does-really-cost-much","08:35 PM","government-debates","12"
"10-01-2006","8005",1,"None","None","None","Yossarian","233304","Let's say 5 Billion dollars a month in Iraq. 5 Billion divided by 30 = 166.7 Million dollars a day. There are over 300 Million people in the United States. Figuring that more than half are taxpayers we could roughly say that's a buck a day per taxpayer. Pretty cheap for a war, eh? 30 bucks a month? A little more than Netflix, sure, but still cheap. And for the low-low price of 30 dollars a month we get.... 3$-plus gasoline per gallon (tho it's dropped here recently, and am I the only one who sees an inverse correlation between that drop and the number of election signs increasing?); 2 going on 3 thousand dead-in-combat (assuming that number's true); several hundred thousand dead Iraqis and Afghanis; record profits for ExxonMobil, ShellBP, etc.; at least ten thousand armless or legless soldiers...the list goes on. Oh, and Dick Cheney keeps piling up deferred payments, so at least he'll be better off when he gets outta office. Don't know about the rest of us.","does-really-cost-much","10:39 PM","government-debates","13"
