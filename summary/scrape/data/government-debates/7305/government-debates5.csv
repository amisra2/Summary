And on a totally unrelated topic. It is perfectly acceptable to use actions that directly kill human beings (including children) in order to fight against perceived threats to our society.","Evan","225438","Thats sick, I hope your not actually suggesting that murdering an innocent child is alright as long as it betters society. Yes. War is inevitable, and so are casualties of war. The difference is, soldiers do not go around killing people that are not shooting back, and if they do they are punished (at least in armies like the American army, Canadian army ext...). There are always going to be those that will not adhere to peaceful solutions, and those people must be dealt with through force.","fav-president","05:06 PM","government-debates","61"

Which in my book... is killing a human being... a child."" Civilians casualties are an absolute certainty. We may try to minimize them, but there is no doubt that we are directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of innocents in Iraq. It is pure hypocrisy to state that the death of an innocent is utterly unacceptable on one hand and yet a necessary evil on the other... The question is this: ""Is it acceptable for a government to be knowingly responsible for the deaths of innocents in order to do what it believes is the right thing?"" I think you can only answer that in one way, and it applies to both scenarios.","fav-president","05:21 PM","government-debates","62"

No, but then again the American government is not responsible for the deaths of innocent iraqis. It does not apply to both senarios, In one you have a doctor killing an innocent baby.

Dying for freedom and the safety of your country is dying in vain... maybe we just have a different definition of vain. Saddam harboured terrorists, he had training camps for terrorists and openly announced and encouraged attacks on the USA (ever here of pre-emptive strike?). they also imposed something like 15 sanctions on him to totally disarm himself of ALL weapons of mass destruction, not just some. He did not. He messed around with Clinton, and the UN, but not Bush. Even though they have still elected a new Prim Minister, and they have a Constitution, and we do have to stay longer. Theres still violence in Iraq and it would be irresponsible to back out, wither you disagree with the war or not. America went in there and they must finish the Job they started.","Ooaman","225454","By the way, in the case of Iraq, there are at least 5 cases of that. Saddam had no WMD. I was under the idea that everyone knew that. I guess not. My definition of dying in vain is when the soldures go over to fight a war and loose their lives when we have no business being over there anyway. Were there terrorist in Iraq? Yes. Are there terrorist in Saudi Arabia? Well, bin Laden's from there. Are there terrorist in Israel/Palestine? Yes. There are terrorist all over the Middle East. Do we have terrorist in the United States? Yes. I'm not talking about Islamic terrorist in prision here in the US, I'm talking even of the Christian faith. Usually who misinterprit the scripture. However, the Insurgence were not a problem until we went to war. Our freedom was not in question when we went to war with Iraq. We were given no real threat from Iraq until we went to war with Iraq and even then, our only real threat was given to us from bin Laden who (along with most of Islam) saw us going to war with Islam. By the way, I remember hearing that Saddam said one time that his favorite American presidents were Clinton AND Reagan.","fav-president","05:45 PM","government-debates","68"

Of course it is. The US decided to send in troops. The US knew that said decision would cause the deaths of innocents. Therefore the US are responsible. Just like they were in WW2 or any other war for that matter, responsibility for the consequences goes with the decision, I doubt even Bush would deny that. I find the fact that you do utterly delusional. BTW you do realize you are using exactly the same justification as a suicide bomber: ""they started it so therefore any innocent deaths are their fault not mine"".","fav-president","06:10 PM","government-debates","70"
"07-30-2006","7305",5,"Evan","None","Again, its not the US soldiers that are killing the Iraqi civilians, its the insurgents in Iraq that are.","Phunting","225468","I quite agree the majority of deaths are, as you say, due to insurgency. But that's not the point. The point is that the US is responsible for civilian deaths. For them not to be, you would have to claim that not one civilian has been killed by US soldiers striking against their targets. Do you make that claim?","fav-president","07:26 PM","government-debates","72"
