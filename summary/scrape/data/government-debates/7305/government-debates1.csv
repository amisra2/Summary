I have always admired the energy of Teddy Roosevelt, a Nobel prizewinner, a physical culturalist, a naval historian, a biographer, an essayist, a paleontologist, a taxidermist, an ornithologist, a field naturalist, a conservationist, a big-game hunter, an editor, a critic, a ranchman, an orator, a country squire, a civil service reformer, a socialite, a patron of the arts, a colonel of the cavalry, a former Governor of New York, the ranking expert on big-game mammals in North America and the President of the U.S. Not a bad scorecard, especially when compared with our current leader.

Thats a little strange combination... Anyways hows everyone doin? i don't post to much on here because i don't have the time, but every once in awhile is fun.

Speaking of ""slower people"", check these examples out: ""Those who enter the country illegally violate the law."" --George W. Bush, Tucson, Ariz., Nov. 28, 2005; ""After standing on the stage, after the debates, I made it very plain, we will not have an all-volunteer army. And yet, this week -- we will have an all-volunteer army!"" --George W. Bush, Daytona Beach, Fla., Oct. 16, 2004; ""The ambassador and the general were briefing me on the the vast majority of Iraqis want to live in a peaceful, free world. And we will find these people and we will bring them to justice."" George W. Bush, Washington, D.C., Oct. 27, 2003; ""I was proud the other day when both Republicans and Democrats stood with me in the Rose Garden to announce their support for a clear statement of purpose: you disarm, or we will.""
