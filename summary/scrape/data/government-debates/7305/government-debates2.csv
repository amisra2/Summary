But since I was born, we've only had 4 presidents. I don't think Any of the Bush family should have been president and I've never really been a fan of Reagan for assuming that Bruce Springsteen's ""Born In The USA"" was a Pro-American song. Confusing song lyrics into something that they are not.","fav-president","10:45 PM","government-debates","16"

"07-27-2006","7305",2,"Dono","None","I've had 6 years of Bushisms to read and am more convinced than ever that his brain is not connected to his mouth. Since he groped the Chancellor of Germany last week, I'm not sure where a connection exists. I asked my daughter and son-in-law (both Aggie Alums) to read them and vote Stupid or out of context .... stupid won 2 to 0. I actually voted for him once and if they ever have a poll on ""worse presidents of the modern era"", I will vote for him again. Dono","Evan","225023","hahahaha, your not serious right. first off there was no groping of the chancellor, he touched her on the shoulders, sence when is that groping? thats almost as bad as when people go yell SEXUAL ASSAULT when a man says ""you look nice today"" to a girl. people touch other people on the shoulders all the time, theres nothing sexual about it, so i suggest you and the dems give it a rest. Also as stated, maybe you should actual read what he's saying, are you telling me that you and your daughter and son in law (who are both Aggie Alums) speak in perfect context all the time. I will garentee you that Bush would XXXX you away with his intellect if you ever had a conversation with him. He's not a stupid man. Actually, he's probably one of the few men that a perfect for the Job. I don't agree with everything he does, but he does what he feels is right no matter what other people say. You know what he's all about, he doesn't mess around and try to please everyone. he governs on principle and belief not what polls say. And i think thats a great thing, and thats how it should be. If you don't agree with what he does then don't vote for him, but at least you know where he stands. If i could, which i can't becasue im Canadian, i would vote him one of the best presidents ever, next to Reagan lol.","fav-president","08:19 PM","government-debates","20"

He's not exactly the intelligent type, but that's not always necessary for the white house. You can't be stupid and get elected, but he is a far cry from intelligent.","fav-president","11:49 PM","government-debates","26"

You know what i think most people just confuse his friendly down to earth way of acting as being unintelligent. Also alot of people say it because they see all these funny clips on the net. Well you know what, i don't think it means anything if you can't pronouce ""Nuclear"", heck i can't say ""rediculous"". And plus he's on camera constitently, he's bound to miss something. I bet every president has done it many times. This is just something the dems have chosen to prey on with this particular republican president, becasue they can't really attack anything else; the economy is great, unemployment is down ext, ext, ext. O and our buddy George had a average of 77. http://www.danzfamily.com/archives/2...grades_ker.php take alook, its pretty interesting. you have people like kerry and al gore attacking bushs intelligence but they did worse in school then he did. lol Gore got 5 F's out of 8 classes.","fav-president","12:14 AM","government-debates","27"

I have no doubt that the CEO's of Merrill Lynch (over $200,000), MBNA, the credit card company ($240,675), Lehman Brothers, the large investment banking firm ($152,000), Haynes & Boone, a Texas law firm ($141,400) would not have a problem reaching him. They did not, however, donate that much to conduct a spelling bee. Sarcasm. properly used, can be an effective argument tool.... or it can make one seem foolish. Hopefully you will get better at it with practice. Dono","fav-president","12:21 AM","government-debates","28"

The man can't string three sentences together without coming across as an idiot in some way. It is not just something that people have chosen to attack him on randomly. With Quayle it was funny and people weren't so worried about it because he was VP. But Bush does it 10 times as much as Quayle ever did, and to make it worse, he's pres, not veep. Second, of course there are plenty of very real things to criticize him on and he is. Even a lot of republicans are distancing themselves from him.","fav-president","12:41 AM","government-debates","29"

And the Republican Party is fine, and he is not being criticised on failures. Republicans (at least not the moderates that seen to be out to sabotage everything) are not distancing them selfs they simply don't agree with his immigration policy.","fav-president","01:01 AM","government-debates","30"
