Republicans (at least not the moderates that seen to be out to sabotage everything) are not distancing them selfs they simply don't agree with his immigration policy.","Master_Shake","225061","You really can't be serious. They will be EXTREMELY lucky if they don't lose the house come November. Of course you don't see it as him being criticized for failures, because you don't see him as failing at anything. But he is being criticized tremendously and justly. Many don't agree with wire-tapping either. Many have problems with the way the Iraq war is beign cvarried out. Just to mention a couple.","fav-president","01:18 AM","government-debates","31"
"07-28-2006","7305",3,"Evan","None","Your not serious, have you ever even heard him speak live. He's very convincing and does it just fine.","Ooaman","225062","Uhh... No.","fav-president","01:31 AM","government-debates","32"

The Dems hate him and the liberal media hate him, and those two are the ones that are criticizing him. Again Democrats... and on the subject of the iraq war, i think they're probably just criticizing it because its war.. you don't here any other plain coming out of any democrats besides cut and run.","fav-president","02:15 AM","government-debates","33"

You apparently don't pay much attention to American news. Haven't you ever heard of Arlen Specter? (I'm not sure if I'm spelling his name right) And that's just one. That is really beside the point And no, they are not just criticizing it because it is war. They are criticizing it because it is a bad war and because it is failing.

"07-28-2006","7305",3,"None","None","None","Big_Bear_Scot","225072","This has devolved into a Bush slagging match. I like I live in the UK and Bush is ridiculed for his mangled English and his limited intellect. For example in the TV program Dead Ringers every sentence that the Bush utters is totally muddled and makes no sense what so ever. Another program called 2DTV, Bush is shown as 'child like' he has to get complicated foreign affairs issues explained to him by a sock puppet. He even taped over Bin Ladens last Video with an episode of Sesame Street.","fav-president","04:28 AM","government-debates","36"
"07-28-2006","7305",3,"Evan","None","hahahaha, your not serious right. first off there was no groping of the chancellor, he touched her on the shoulders, sence when is that groping? thats almost as bad as when people go yell SEXUAL ASSAULT when a man says ""you look nice today"" to a girl. people touch other people on the shoulders all the time, theres nothing sexual about it, so i suggest you and the dems give it a rest.","Rovdak","225076","Haha, well I'll tell you this, if I stand up and give one of my female classmates a neckrub without her specifically asking, she'll interpret it as me coming on to her. Don't know how unauthorised neckrubs in the US are percieved, but it's a very ambigious action round here, and since we are neighbouring to Germany, I have little reason to expect it being different for Merkel, especially since she is a Christian democrat (thus reasonably conservative). Unauthorised touching of women is not done in polite society","fav-president","05:45 AM","government-debates","37"
"07-28-2006","7305",3,"Evan","None","uhh... Yes.","Ooaman","225103","I don't remember a time when he was convincing. Don't forget, he did hold a premature Mission Accomplished victory party for the shenanigans in Iraq. That was what, 3 years and a few months ago. I stoped believing in him when he was openly dishonest all the time. He still has yet to convince me of diddly squat.","fav-president","10:40 AM","government-debates","38"

Hes all for abortion, gay marriage, things like that. theres always going to be people from both sides that don't agree on everything. the majority of the true blue (guess red in America) conservatives agree. And take a look at Joseph Lieberman he's facing the big possibility of not being renominated by the Dems because of his views on the war. And the war is not failing, i don't see how you can say that when Iraq has elected a Prime Minister, Terrorist cells are being destroyed, Al Qaeda leaders are being captured or killed, they've created a new Constitution, they're taking control over more provinces, and thats just a couple of the successes. The war is not failing by any means. What does that have to do with anything... How old are you?","fav-president","01:41 PM","government-debates","39"

The cells are not really being destroyed. By the way, have we captured bin Laden yet? Why are we wasting our time in Iraq when we haven't even gotten the guy we first decided to go after? Besides, the last time we got the number one man in Iraq who was the head of the terrorist group there, they just got the new guy. It's natural to shut someone out if all they do is just lie to you anyway. Also, if I think too hard about what he's saying, I'm probibly going to get a headache.

But it's when people actually say that he is the ""best"" I get suspicious. I mean come on, there have been far far better Republican presidents. Are you seriously saying that in over 200 years the most masterful, statesmanlike and downright exceptional President is him? him ?! There are only two reasons I can think that anyone would say that. Mindless Patriotism. That daft belief these days that if you don't put your support 100% behind everything the Government says and does you're not a ""proper"" American. Or more likely I think that you are just trying to goad people into starting a slagging match, making stupid statements like that just because you want to wind perceived ""liberals"" up...","fav-president","09:38 AM","government-debates","45"
