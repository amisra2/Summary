However if you accept that position, then it isn't justifiable to state you're against stem cell research because you're against ""killing babies for any reason"".","fav-president","08:19 PM","government-debates","76"

Edit: Hey stop changing your post! Every time I look it says something different. Though I agree, I'm not sure what is meant by that either...","fav-president","08:24 PM","government-debates","77"

And besides, theres other ways to get stem cells which i have no problem with, and neither does any one else. Its just because the ones taken from a killed fetus are the best and thats why people want them, i don't think thats right.","fav-president","08:29 PM","government-debates","78"

But i can change it to something more to your liking if you wish. lol sorry","fav-president","08:31 PM","government-debates","79"

You are saying it's not OK for an innocent to die to help alleviate suffering of another but it is ok for an innocent to die to protect our 'freedoms'. Surely you see the contradiction in such a statement?","fav-president","08:33 PM","government-debates","80"

It just seems odd, personally whilst Im interested in US politics, if I wanted to make a political statement in my avatar it would be to do with UK politics as theyre what directly affect me. I wasn't criticizing, I was just interested edit: Heh, much better! edit: Err, not sure who that is now: still Harper? Anyway enough of these irrelevancies...","fav-president","08:37 PM","government-debates","81"

Is that pic alittle more Canadian for ya.","fav-president","08:40 PM","government-debates","82"

Deciding not to kill that child is not something evil at all, and going to war, although unwanted and i suppose you could say it has its evils, is nessary. Also, this may sound like a stupid question, but who is that in you pic?","fav-president","08:58 PM","government-debates","84"

Action was long over due. hahaha thats awesome that i didn't figure it out. Ya i should know what he looks like, but frankly i don't care, i know what he's all about and i'll take more interest in the liberals when they actually get a set leader.","fav-president","09:18 PM","government-debates","86"
