"07-29-2006","7305",4,"Phunting","None","I can believe people consider Bush a ""good"" president, even though I don't agree myself at all. But it's when people actually say that he is the ""best"" I get suspicious. I mean come on, there have been far far better Republican presidents. Are you seriously saying that in over 200 years the most masterful, statesmanlike and downright exceptional President is him? him ?! There are only two reasons I can think that anyone would say that. Mindless Patriotism. That daft belief these days that if you don't put your support 100% behind everything the Government says and does you're not a ""proper"" American. Or more likely I think that you are just trying to goad people into starting a slagging match, making stupid statements like that just because you want to wind perceived ""liberals"" up...","georged","225268","I know few people who still support current administration and even the most die-hard of that political group following central party dogma for obvious reasons isn't mindless enough to name Bush as the 'best'. I admit my range of acquaintances doesn't include any evangelicals or stanch Christians, who obviously support Bush based on his despicable public record of promoting Christian morality in government.","fav-president","10:31 AM","government-debates","46"

Does it go against Christ to heal the sick? Medicnes could improve greatly with the use of stem cell research. I'll quicky mention 2 people (1 still alive and one dead) who could have (or could be) greatly healed with stem cell research. For one, Christerpher Reeves could have still been alive if stem cell research could have been done. Michael J. Fox (and others with Parkingson's (sp?) disease) could be greatly helped with the use of stem cell research. Oh, and one other thing. Bush has no family values. Not just tearing apart gay families but also straight families. He sends husbands/fathers, wives/mother's, sons and daughters over to fight a war that we have no business in being in anyway.","fav-president","01:26 PM","government-debates","49"

"07-30-2006","7305",4,"Master_Shake","None","Of course conservatives agree with the president, but that's only because you define a conservative as someone who agrees with the president Well, this is just delusional. I'm going to modify the old adage and say ""Never argue with a crazy person. People might not be able to tell the difference."" Just as I thought. 21","Evan","225380","umm.. no i consider a conservative someone who is in favor of the conservative ideals... Bush is generally a conservative, although he has done some thing that go against conservatism, for instence; his immigration policy, and spending. So i don't define someone a conservative when they agree with the president, i consider the president a conservative when he does something conservative. your so funny... im 20, so your probably not even a full year older then i am... what was the point of asking my age?","fav-president","04:04 AM","government-debates","51"
"07-30-2006","7305",4,"Ooaman","None","Well, yes, the Iraq war is a sucess. If the idea is to kill innocent civillians and as many American soldures as possible. The cells are not really being destroyed. By the way, have we captured bin Laden yet? Why are we wasting our time in Iraq when we haven't even gotten the guy we first decided to go after? Besides, the last time we got the number one man in Iraq who was the head of the terrorist group there, they just got the new guy. It's natural to shut someone out if all they do is just lie to you anyway. Also, if I think too hard about what he's saying, I'm probibly going to get a headache. No thank you.","Evan","225383","You libs, i don't get it... THE USA IS AT WAR!!! people die, soldiers die. Its sad but thats afact of war. You can NOT judge the sucess of a war based on the fact that people have died. and just so you know, the war in Iraq has prove to have the lest amount of American deaths out of any major war American has fought. Its called the ""War on Terror"", not the ""War on Bin Laden"". Saddam was just a big of a threat. thats nice. Again liberals show big talk, and no substance.","fav-president","04:16 AM","government-debates","52"

Bush is against stem cell research when the stem cells are taken from a killed fetus. I don't know, maybe its just me, but christians usually don't like killing babies for any reason. And last time i heard there wasn't a draft... those soldiers signed up into the army knowing full well what they were getting into, they're out there fighting for freedom and the safety of America and you sit there and throw it back at them.","fav-president","04:26 AM","government-debates","54"

Doctors study dead bodies to improve there doctoring. Why don't they study dead fetuses. Those soldiers knew full well that they could die. Possibly. Their training is probably kill or be killed. But fighting in Iraq was a loss cause from the beginning and they are dying in vain. At least the ones who actually died in battle in Afghanistan died for a real cause. The war in Iraq has nothing to do with the War on Terror. We went to war with Iraq because Saddam made fun of Bush's Daddy. Now we are still over there for no real reason. They elected a new guy. They have their constatution. Why do we need to stay over there any longer? Why don't we go back to looking for bin Laden?","fav-president","08:46 AM","government-debates","55"

I would hardly agree with that either, though I do think he was a damn sight better than Bush. It just seems the idolatory of Bush by certian people is on a whole new level. To contrast the way the two were stated on this thread, Truthsayer simply puts whereas coolcodemn3 with the tagline ""Dubya 2008"" writes That's what makes me suspicious. Not just the statement that they think Bush is good/ the best but the in-your-face need to scream it. To state it in an utterly over the top and needless way.

Many presidents, possibly most, have had a conflict in which they have sent troops to die. That's not lack of 'family values', that's soldiering. If you don't agree with the Iraq war, fair enough. But I don't see how it can be portrayed as anti-family.","fav-president","09:57 AM","government-debates","58"

Which in my book and any good Christians (like Bush) is killing a human being... a child. Dying for freedom and the safety of your country is dying in vain... maybe we just have a different definition of vain. Saddam harboured terrorists, he had training camps for terrorists and openly announced and encouraged attacks on the USA (ever here of pre-emptive strike?). they also imposed something like 15 sanctions on him to totally disarm himself of ALL weapons of mass destruction, not just some. He did not. He messed around with Clinton, and the UN, but not Bush. Even though they have still elected a new Prim Minister, and they have a Constitution, and we do have to stay longer. Theres still violence in Iraq and it would be irresponsible to back out, wither you disagree with the war or not. America went in there and they must finish the Job they started. O did i mention Saddam killed his own people.","fav-president","02:58 PM","government-debates","59"
"07-30-2006","7305",4,"None","None","None","Phunting","225426","So to paraphrase: Killing a human being (especially a child) is abhorrent to all Good Christians (like Bush), even for the betterment of our society. And on a totally unrelated topic. It is perfectly acceptable to use actions that directly kill human beings (including children) in order to fight against perceived threats to our society.","fav-president","04:12 PM","government-debates","60"
