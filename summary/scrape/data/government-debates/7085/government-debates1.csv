I interperate the 9th and 10 amendments to allow abortion and samesex marriage. These are examples of rights reserved to the people.

There isn't many questions about how many branches of government we have or how the government is set up. The part that may be considered vague is the judicial branch but with a little bit of background it suddenly becomes not vague. You can interperate the 9th and 10th amendments however you want but it just doesn't mean that. abortion and same sex marriage are reserved for the states or people as you say though. You forget the other part of that amendment. The 9th amendment could also been seen as vague but the better way to look at it is useless...it just says don't misuse the constitution to further your own cause..in other words, find loopholes. I guess that is only mildly important.","could-we-write-better-constitution-today","08:35 PM","government-debates","7"

Actually I'll go even further. The federal government has NO Constitutional authority to establish marriage. But that doesn't stop too many people.","could-we-write-better-constitution-today","11:30 PM","government-debates","8"
"01-09-2006","7085",1,"None","None","None","zachvac","191051","I disagree with most people here. The Constitution is pretty specific. The federal government should be very small. It only has the powers delegated to it. It is there to protect our rights, the states do the rest. The federal government is only there to defend the country and make sure a state doesn't violate one of the basic rights of life, liberty, and property. They specifically weren't specific because stuff like gay marriage or marriage in general doesn't belong in the federal government. Their only flaw is they didn't forsee the corruption of politicians but it's pretty obvious. We let people make laws giving them more power. Of course back then and in theory you just elect someone else, but until people start going for 3rd parties, corruption and ""at least I'm better than him"" will rule politics.","could-we-write-better-constitution-today","11:34 PM","government-debates","9"

It's an old document, and newer constitutions have developped improved ways of expressing their content. However, the concensus needed to form a new constitution, to determine the constitution's content, would be hard to achieve. Essentially, you would have trouble deciding WHAT the counstitution should say, but once that would be done, the question of HOW would the constitution express this consensus would be far easier.","could-we-write-better-constitution-today","02:33 AM","government-debates","10"

The Constitutional question isn't whether there should be marriage or shouldn't be -- the states have decided there should be. One Constitutional guarantee is that a marriage in one state is valid in another (with very few restrictions). The Constitutional question today is whether the states are allowed to discriminate in applying their marriage laws. Even the opposition to same-sex marriage effectively concedes that they are not allowed to do so. The push for a Constitutional amendment shows that.","could-we-write-better-constitution-today","07:07 PM","government-debates","14"
