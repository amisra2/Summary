It has very little to do with moral or actual law, and the parts (which are few) that are sane, can be derrived from any other moral system. It's a travesty that they venerate it so.","just-one-little-s","12:28 AM","government-debates","16"

Take, for example, ""Thou shalt have no other god but me,"" or ""Remember the sabbath day and keep it holy."" These are not ""universal moral principles"" in any way.","just-one-little-s","12:56 AM","government-debates","17"

"01-20-2005","3634",2,"pnac=ww3","None","And let's say I believe in ONE god too, but that god is different from your god. The phrase isn't ""In god Toxey trusts"" it's ""In gods WE Trust."" Yes, and that god is Ahura Mazda.","georged","87648","That should get the Christian thumpers going. Tell them you're armed and maybe their new prophet will invade you for your resources.

Let's say you have a bike (it's red). Let's say I have a bike (it's blue). Now, which is the correct statement? a) We have a bike. b) We have bikes. If you chose (b) then you get a gold star! If we own the same bike together then (a) would be right, but we don't have the same bike, we have different bikes. If we trust the same god together then ""In god we trust"" would be correct. But we don't, so ""In gods we trust"" is correct.","just-one-little-s","04:13 PM","government-debates","29"
