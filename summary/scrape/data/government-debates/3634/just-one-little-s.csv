There are people of many cultures and religions living here and making there lives. We all worship differently and even worship different gods if we do at all. So there are many gods that Americans as a group worship and ""trust."" In various official places, usually on a wall in a courtroom and on official seals and money, there is the phrase ""In God We Trust"" But this implies that there is only one god that we as a nation trust. This just isn't the case since there multiple religions and multiple gods that are being trusted. What would be so bad about adding a little ""s"" right in the middle? ""In Gods We Trust."" At the very least, this is a much more accurate statement. Thoughts? .","just-one-little-s","01:25 PM","government-debates","1"

Thoughts? .","georged","75393","Christians require a newer testament for all changes and as historical/geographical accuracy has never been a big deal, maybe they can choose a new group of oracles who can pen one using the plural version of God and GPS readings. Wait, the GPS could mean a new worship symbol requiring even more 'tithes', so maybe that part isn't such a good idea.","just-one-little-s","03:14 PM","government-debates","2"

An interesting point, but still appears directed at the very mention of God in governmental affairs. Our founding fathers and the writers of the Constitution did NOT intend for us to be a country without God or the mention of His name. All they say in the First Amendment is that the government shall not require or deny the right to worship. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. Having ""In God we trust"" on coins and currency does not establish a religion, though it does recognize the existence of God.

I just don't care, honestly. I'm asking YOU if you would care if we put an ""s"" at the end of the word ""god"" wherever it says ""In God We Trust."" The statement would be more accurate. Ok, the 10 commandments cover the ""big three"" religions. Xians, Jews, and Muslims all look to Moses as a prohpet and revere the 10 cdmts. Would YOU care if Hammurabi's Code or Codified Roman Law were up there instead of the big 10? .","just-one-little-s","08:28 PM","government-debates","6"

I'm looking for people that would care one way or another. I think we should start putting it up there and see how many complaints we get, and what those complaints are.

I don't think so. We can say that the Xian/Jew/Muslim triad all look to the ""same"" god (even though each would say the other worships a false god), but that leaves out Hindus, or Wiccans, or Pagans, or Buddhists (that don't really look to a god), or any other religion that's not one of those three.
