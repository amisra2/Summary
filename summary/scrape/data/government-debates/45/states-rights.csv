"02-04-2003","45",1,"None","None","None","dsadevil","902","What is this, a 3rd grade standardized test? (what is the purpose of the federal government? Explain your answer in complete sentences.) I believe the fed govt. is made up of both inherant, implied and delegated powers. The delegated ones are found in Art 1 Sec 8. The implied ones come through the necessary and proper clause and must relate to I.8. The inheirant powers are the ones that are necessary for a government to be national and federal. The 10th amendment talks about ""reserving"" rights to the states. A state can't reserve a right it never had, thus any right that comes into existance solely from the existance of the federal government is given to the government via the supremacy clause.","states-rights","05:50 PM","government-debates","5"
"02-04-2003","45",1,"None","None","None","American","911","Dsa, ""The Tenth Amendment's use of the word 'reserved' does not help the majority's position. If someone says that the power to use a particular facility is reserved to some group, he is not saying anything about whether that group has previously used the facility. He is merely saying that the people who control the facility have designated that group as the entity with authority to use it. The Tenth Amendment is similar: the people of the States, from whom all governmental powers stem, have specified that all powers not prohibited to the States by the Federal Constitution are reserved 'to the States respectively, or to the people.'"" (Thornton, Thomas, J. dissenting) ""the plan of the convention aims only at a partial union or consolidation, the State governments would clearly retain all the rights of sovereignty which they before had, and which were not, by that act, EXCLUSIVELY delegated to the United States. This exclusive delegation, or rather this alienation, of State sovereignty, would only exist in three cases: where the Constitution in express terms granted an exclusive authority to the Union; where it granted in one instance an authority to the Union, and in another prohibited the States from exercising the like authority; and where it granted an authority to the Union, to which a similar authority in the States would be absolutely and totally CONTRADICTORY and REPUGNANT."" (Hamiton, Federalist 32)(emphasis in original) ""All legislative powers herein GRANTED..."" (US Const. Art. 1, Sec. 1, cl. 1)(emphasis added) There are three forms of proof that our government was one of completely delegated powers, with ""Those powers NOT DELEGATED to the United States...are reserved to the States respectively or to the people."" (Amend. 10)(emphasis added)","states-rights","07:57 PM","government-debates","6"
"02-04-2003","45",1,"None","None","None","dsadevil","930","Your reserving a facility argument is a straw man. The group COULD have reserved the facility, the fact that it had or hadn't not withstanding, because the facility had existed prior to when the group made its reservation. The New Federal government did not exist (a weak confederal govt. did) at the time of the constitution's ratification, so nothing could be reserved that wasn't in existance before hand. A better example would be this. Here is a better analogy. There are three restruants on a street, X, Y, and Z. The ""states"" have a reserved table at each one every day. At somepoint, for whatever reason, they decide to allow an office building to go up on that street. They say that the tenants of the building can have an exclusive table at X, but all rights to the restruants not granted to the office are reserved to the states (so they keep Y and Z). Office says sure, and then as part of its office building complex they build a cafeteria in the lobby of their building. The question: does the state, by virtue of ""reserving"" restruant rights, get a free table at a restraunt that didn't exist when it made the proclaimation, but was ancilliary to the creation of the new office? hardly, because the states a) didn't have the rights to the as yet non-existant cafeteria and b) therefore couldn't grant the right they didn't have even if they wanted to. Similarly, powers that exist only due to the formation of the federal government couldn't have been reserved to the states nor granted to the government because they didn't exist and the state had no authority to grant a power it doesn't have. (Hence why Thomas, once again, is relegated to dissenting. I would advice the honorable Justice Thomas to leave the heavy lifting to his Collegue justice Scalia, especially when going head to head with an intellectual titan (and republican) such as John Paul Stevens). The use of the word ""granted"" is important because of the change from the articles of confederation, which said ""expressly granted."" obviously the framers wanted a bit more wiggle room here. This provides the basis of implied powers (along with the nec. and proper clause, see McColluch v. Maryland (J. Marshall, opinion of the court)). You have still yet to adequately explain how a state, or any one can ""grant"" a power it never posessed in the first place. Although I admit it would be fun. ""Hey, I grant me that skyscraper! And my neighbors Lexus!""","states-rights","10:16 PM","government-debates","7"
"02-05-2003","45",1,"None","None","None","American","1035","Dsa, The basic idea at the founding of this nation under the Constitution was that the States were supreme in every area that they didn't grant to the federal government. The States granted complete sovereignty to the federal government in the area of foreign relations. The States also granted certain enumerated powers in the domestic realm (Art 1, Sec 8). Abel Upshur makes this observation with regard to the Necessary and Proper Clause: ""Strickly speaking, then, the Constitution allows no implication of favor of the Federal Government, in any case whatever. Every power which it can properly exert is a granted power. All these are enumerated in the Constitution, and nothing can be constitutionally done, beyond that enumeration, unless it be done as a means of executing some one of the enumerated powers. These means are granted, not implied."" By reading the Federalist Papers one will find that the framers saw the Constitution as providing ""few and defined"" powers to the Federal Government, while reserving to the States ""numerous and indefinite"" powers. (Madison, Federalist 45) I believe the evidence is solid, the powers delegated in the Constitution are the only ones that Congress may rightly exercise.","states-rights","05:39 PM","government-debates","8"
"02-05-2003","45",1,"None","None","None","American","1056","Dsa, I respect you very much, please don't go around destroying that respect without need. The Necessary and Proper Clause says, ""To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States."" It should be clear from reading the whole clause that those ""necessary and proper"" laws must relate to two things, 1) ""the foregoing powers,"" those powers listed in Art 1, Sec 8, and 2) ""all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States,"" those powers which are not enumerated in Art 1, Sec 8. All other powers are reserved to the States by the 10th Amend. The Constitution was written is such a way as to make clear that the powers of the Federal Government are limited to those granted in the Constitution itself.","states-rights","07:10 PM","government-debates","10"
"02-05-2003","45",1,"None","None","None","dsadevil","1069","Where do you get that from? The nec. and proper clause, as you say, relates to the powers already granted, specifically, it says that in addition to being able to have those powers, it has the power to enact any law that is needed in the pursuit of those powers. The national bank (to regulate interstate commerce), the issue decided in McColluch, is a good example of a power that isn't expressly mentioned but proper to implement so congress can effectively regulate interstate commerce. Nobodies denying that a ""N&P"" law needs to relate to a I.8 power. It is just clear that ""relating"" is not synonomous with ""equal to."" Otherwise, the NP clause is redundant. Furthermore, the phrase ""all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States"" implies that their are ""other powers"" that are vested in the US. The states, once more, can only reserve what they have already possessed. Any power that they never possessed in the first place they can't ""grant"" ""vest"" ""reserve"" or act upon. (BTW, how did I destroy respect?)","states-rights","09:36 PM","government-debates","11"
"02-06-2003","45",1,"None","None","None","American","1120","Dsa, You say, ""any power that comes into existance due to the prescence of a federal government is federal as well."" Then you say, ""a 'N&P' law needs to relate to a I.8 power."" So is the federal government regulated to those powers enumerated in the Constitution, or is it allowed to expand outside of those powers? Your two comments say that the government can take a power not enumerated and exercise it because it is the federal government, but those laws have to be related to a power enumerated. I guess I am lost in this logic. Care to explain? (I didn't say that you destroyed my respect for you, just that you were going to if you didn't read the Constitution, and take it for what it says (without regard to the framers views).)","states-rights","02:12 PM","government-debates","12"

"02-06-2003","45",2,"None","None","None","American","1221","Chauncey Burr, in relation to this matter, says: ""It is the rule laid down by Blackstone, that the intention of the parties to a compact is the key to its meaning. The terms and language must be referred to the time of its enactment, and must be taken as understood by those who so employed them, and not according to any subsequent definition. Thus the Constitution of the United States must be explained as those who made and framed it intended. Their INTENTION IS THE LAW...Such were the rules by [which] the Constitution was interpreted by the Supreme Court undeviatingly from the foundation of the government to 1863. Since this last date a change has come over the spirit of the judiciary which is in violation of all the past rules of interpretation, and indeed of judicial proceeding among all enlightened nations. The doctrine has been boldly proclaimed, by leading journals, that laws and compacts are to be construed so as to be in harmony with the 'will of the people,' as judges have, in too many instances, succumbed to this monstrous delusion...It indeed amounts to the overthrow of all fixed and regular governments, and leaves the passions and fancies of an hour the only guarantees of liberty.""","states-rights","08:48 PM","government-debates","16"
