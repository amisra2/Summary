The terms and language must be referred to the time of its enactment, and must be taken as understood by those who so employed them, and not according to any subsequent definition. Thus the Constitution of the United States must be explained as those who made and framed it intended. Their INTENTION IS THE LAW...Such were the rules by [which] the Constitution was interpreted by the Supreme Court undeviatingly from the foundation of the government to 1863. Since this last date a change has come over the spirit of the judiciary which is in violation of all the past rules of interpretation, and indeed of judicial proceeding among all enlightened nations. The doctrine has been boldly proclaimed, by leading journals, that laws and compacts are to be construed so as to be in harmony with the 'will of the people,' as judges have, in too many instances, succumbed to this monstrous delusion...It indeed amounts to the overthrow of all fixed and regular governments, and leaves the passions and fancies of an hour the only guarantees of liberty.""","states-rights","08:48 PM","government-debates","16"
