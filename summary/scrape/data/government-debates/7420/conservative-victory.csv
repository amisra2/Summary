Personally, whilst I had no love for Martin I still agree with the Liberal policies slightly more than the Tory ones and would have preferred a Liberal victory.","conservative-victory","08:05 AM","government-debates","1"

Many of the Tories elected are moderates and not conservative. I am not a Candian citizen, only in my heart am I Canadian, so I can not speak to what Canadian citizens were thinking.","conservative-victory","05:45 AM","government-debates","5"

They are right of center, but not nearly to the degree that the Republicans are, especially socially (and regarding religion). The do share conservative ideologies - smaller gov't, lower taxes, greater personal freedom/responsibility, pro-business, increased military spending, etc...

They have won a slim minority government. There are four parties in Canada's parliament. The Conservatives have slightly more seats than any one party, but they do not have the majority of seats in the entire Parliament. The Conservatives have to win votes from the other three parties, which are generally to the left of it, ideologically, to pass any new legislation.","conservative-victory","01:04 AM","government-debates","10"
