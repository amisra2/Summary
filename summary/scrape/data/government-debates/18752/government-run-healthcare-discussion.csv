Who's going to be the winners in this matter: will it be the American people who are facing the threat of having to buy intangible and unwanted concepts because government says they have no other choice in the matter; or the federal government that will be greatly empowered under the commerce clause and able to tell the American people when they have to spend their money and on what even if they don't want it in the first place?","government-run-healthcare-discussion","07:18 PM","government-debates","1"

"06-27-2012","18752",1,"Freedom","457924","I think they will rule it constitutional.","Tabbi","457926","If they do then they've opened a can of worms in allowing the government to expand on what it can regulate under the commerce clause. If they can force you to buy health insurance or face a tax penalty they can force you to buy a new car yearly, or a new house, or an apartment, or go out and see whatever new movie is playing at the local theater, and you won't be able to do **** about it, all because the government claims they're regulating commerce. And if you don't like that idea then you'd better get on your knees and start praying to Santa Maria that the Supreme Court isn't willing to be quite so radical.","government-run-healthcare-discussion","11:42 PM","government-debates","3"

Now for anyone who thinks this is some radical new encroachment of government, please answer the following question: In practice or even in theory, what difference is there between forcing people to buy something ; and taxing everyone to pay for something you give away for free, and then granting tax breaks for certain people/situations ?","government-run-healthcare-discussion","12:21 PM","government-debates","4"
