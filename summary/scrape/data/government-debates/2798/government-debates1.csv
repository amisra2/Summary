Some advocate raising the minimum wage--but this would raise the price of unskilled labor above its free-market value. Mass unemployment would result. 9. We can immediately create millions of new jobs. Conservative estimates place the number of illegal aliens in the U.S. at 10,000,000. Taking into account minor children and the aged, that's still millions of people who are flooding our labor force. Remove them, and opportunities will abound for Americans. There's a canard that says that illegals ""take the jobs Americans don't want."" This is a fallacy! There's no job an American can't or won't do for a living wage. It is a cruel joke on the American worker to allow illegals to depress wages for many jobs below poverty level, and then to mock Americans for being reluctant to participate in the poverty. 8. Breaking the law is crime. Lawbreakers are criminals. Out of deference to the PC crowd, many like to use the term ""undocumented workers""--as if illegals were merely missing a piece of bureaucratic paperwork. By the same logic, we can call a car thief an ""undocumented driver."" Our immigration laws exist for good reasons: to protect our safety, our national sovereignty, our standard of living, our health, and our culture. Those who break them may ""want a better life for themselves,"" but then again, so do all who enrich themselves by disregarding the law. 7. Open borders threaten our safety. Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, two things have become clear. First, we have enemies, and they are vicious and without conscience. Second, our enemies obviously believe that an attack from within is more feasible than an attack from without. More importantly, the creeping ideology of open borders--the (usually unspoken) belief that treating foreigners who enter our country differently than we treat our own citizens is somehow ""discriminatory"" or ""racist""--is creating a terrible dilemma: Either we cease to monitor the aliens (and open ourselves up for even worse attacks), or we create the ""equality"" of the police state by casting aside constitutional protections for citizens and monitoring everyone. 6. We're a nation of 300 million; the Third World population is in the billions. Do the math. Our country seems large, but its population is tiny compared to that of the Third World. China and India alone have seven times our population. 5. American culture is worth preserving. Culture is more than operas and Shakespearian plays--it's the sum total of the customs, beliefs, artistic creations, attitudes, goals, and norms that make a society what it is. It is passed down, as a treasure, from grandparent to parent to child. In other words, culture is what gives us our identity. Some advocate ""multiculturalism""--creating a society in which multiple cultures exist side by side, and believe that ""diversity""--having as many cultures as possible, with none dominant-is desirable. The majority of the media elite believes that we need more multiculturalism and diversity; the majority of the population doesn't.

"07-23-2004","2798",1,"None","None","None","georged","59534","10. Why is there a minimum wage? Why not let the market decide what's acceptable? 9. One of four Americans receive a government check of some sort. Try and find an 'American' who will perform low level jobs in the US when government support is so easily achieved. 8. I thought anyone in America is innocent until proven guilty. 7. The US is one of the most racist countries in the civilized world. Nigger, spic, raghead, gook and other such endearing, literate terms are pure US bred. 6. Easy math, at 4% of the population we're telling the rest of the world only our way is right. If you don't agree and aren't one of the primary purchasers of our treasury issues, we'll invade you with our credit card military. If you have oil, other valuable natural resources or don't believe in Jesus. 5. What US culture is revered by anyone else in the world? One example will suffice. Not many literate people consider a 200-year old nation as having much maturity, proven by our murderous aggression around the world over the past 50-years. We specialize in instant gratification, righteousness, aggression and being poor money managers. Ask anyone from outside the US whom we don't have in our pocket through economic/military aid. Buying friends never works as they don't stay bought. Cultural diversity is difficult, if not impossible in a country as racist as the US. We have a few cosmopolitan cities that try and achieve it, but a majority of Americans intensely dislike 'foreigners', even though all but Native Americans originally came from somewhere else. Until you can present some strong points regarding our ability to culturally integrate without Jesus, corn pone or slang getting in the way, this just sounds like more flag waving, the same methodology our sleazy politicians use to convince the populace that its their way or you're unpatriotic. We're becoming a sad remnant of our former inner-strength. You seem rather label prone, so for the record I'm a fiscally conservative registered Republican who voted for Bush 1&2. But hey, I admit my error in character judgement. I'm stubborn in that one lie is enough for me to remove my loyalty to the liar.","top-ten-reasons-close-americas-border","04:07 PM","government-debates","2"

"07-27-2004","2798",1,"Duo_Maxwell","None","When was the last time you saw a White Christan American working as a janitor or cleaning lady in a dingy hotel? Living wage, what is that? You do realize that the people doing the crappy jobs are people who also work 2 or 3 other jobs to make ends meet? .","apathy","59994","I see white janitors all the time. I see white cleaning ladies all the time. I have no idea whether they are christian or not, but they most likely are. I personally know a white girl who works 2 jobs and her husband works overtime constantly, all to make ends meet for their 4yo daughter. Of course, closing our borders is absurd, but don't go saying things like this.","top-ten-reasons-close-americas-border","12:37 PM","government-debates","7"
"08-09-2004","2798",1,"None","None","None","TruPatriot","61594","Though I totally don't agree with all the reasons, I agree with the basic idea to a point and agree with some of the reasons you have given. For example, I have heard of a white person having a job as a janitor at a hotel. But she can't work every day because she has to watch her kids certain days, enjoy a holiday, etc. Also she wanted a raise. But she could not ask her boss because she knew if she asked, they would fire her and hire an illegal alien that doesn't care about days off or how much she makes. This is unfair because the white American pays taxes and is legal but she is treated worse than an illegal alien that doesn't pay tax, kicks another true American onto the unemployed list, and etc. So should borders be cut all the way. No. We can always use the smart people and others that are willing to help our economy. But we don't need illegal aliens and legal aliens that lower our living standards and make America look dumber than we really are. Even some legal aliens and probably illegal aliens receive hard working Americans tax paid welfare when they themselves probably don't even pay taxes themselves. I say probably because some do pay tax. But I still don't see any justice in this. In all, don't close off the borders totally. Just weed out the illegal aliens and the legal aliens that don't want to work and just suck off the wealth of America.","top-ten-reasons-close-americas-border","10:16 PM","government-debates","8"

It becomes more of an extreme in many regional areas, complete with racial overtones. Iraq is an excellent example, they will accept our version of democracy or we kill them. The tired old rationalization of illegal immigrants taking 'American' jobs is based on insecurity. Before we began our economic decline our borders were wide open with the US welcoming those, legal or illegal, who would do the jobs Americans shunned. And still shun. The current rationalization of terrorists using open borders to attack us is equally stupid, promoted by an administration attempting to justify aggressive foreign policy that invites retaliation, as any dedicated terrorist could easily slip into the US or any other country, regardless of security measures. Our Christian based belief system invites hypocrisy.","top-ten-reasons-close-americas-border","08:41 AM","government-debates","11"

I am not saying that we should shut our borders totally. In fact I want people to come to America. But I do not want people coming into to place we Americans and others worked so hard to built and just eating off the profits. The first immigrants that came here, Irish, German, Dutch, etc., worked hard and made a difference in our economy and our government. That's who I want coming into our country. People who are willing and want to make a difference and make this country better. And if that means closing our borders so much that almost no one comes in, then I guess that is what we will have to do.","top-ten-reasons-close-americas-border","05:55 PM","government-debates","13"

Even if we were to prevent illegal immigration we would still have legal immigration. How is that a closed border? Consider the age we are living in as well. Terrorists want into our country. If we leave the border open to illegal immigration then we are letting terrorists into our nation without any documentation. Our very freedoms and way of life are put at risk because of illegal immigration. That is the real reason why it has to end now more than ever. Forget all the other ****. When American lives are at stake it outweights anything else worth considering on this topic. Sadly, I doubt the people who make these types of decisions will realize this fact until American lives are again lost.","top-ten-reasons-close-americas-border","10:26 PM","government-debates","14"
"08-14-2004","2798",1,"None","None","None","georged","62204","Here's a brief consideration for the issue of closing our borders US/Canadian land border - 3,145 miles, mostly subjected to harsh winter weather conditions. US/Mexican land border - 2,000 miles of desert heat. I no longer have the links, but a couple of individuals on other forums did the calculations on what it would logistically require in the way of personnel, transportation and logistics to seal those borders 24/7/365. I believe both used proven Iron Curtain era military containment numbers of 4 troops in permanent emplacements 400 yards apart allowing centering crossfire every 200 yards. Construction costs such as permanent access roads, barracks, daily logisitcs, maintenance, etc. were and are beyond my comprehension, but the number of transportation vehicles would keep Detroit fat for many years. Even I can do the basic personnel number: 17 troops each mile times 5145 = 87,465 x 3 shifts = 262,395 troops if they all work 8/7/365. Military support ratios are 3 for each line troop (4 if contractors are included), so add 787,185 to that number for 1,049,580. At $250k/troop, that's roughly $260 billion/year just for the manpower. Plus all the rest. Then come the Atantic and Pacific Oceans, Gulf of Mexico and Bering Sea. Talk is always cheap, many seem to believe our current pathetic efforts would stop a dedicated terrorist, but why not continue to ignore our foreign policy that invites retaliation? We're already spending $50-billion a year on Homeland Security. Seal the borders and just put it on the national credit card in the name of preserving Democracy?","top-ten-reasons-close-americas-border","12:27 PM","government-debates","15"
