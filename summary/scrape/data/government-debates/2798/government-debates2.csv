Construction costs such as permanent access roads, barracks, daily logisitcs, maintenance, etc. were and are beyond my comprehension, but the number of transportation vehicles would keep Detroit fat for many years. Even I can do the basic personnel number: 17 troops each mile times 5145 = 87,465 x 3 shifts = 262,395 troops if they all work 8/7/365. Military support ratios are 3 for each line troop (4 if contractors are included), so add 787,185 to that number for 1,049,580. At $250k/troop, that's roughly $260 billion/year just for the manpower. Plus all the rest.","TruPatriot","62255","We don't have to do such things. All we have to do is give better equipment to those patrols we already have, hire a couple more, and get more stricter. Not only for those coming into the country, but those already inside the country. This might at most cost a couple of millions dollars which we might have to do to cut down on illegal aliens. Also, did you know that though some people have tipped off the police and the others at the top about some illegal aliens, but they won't do anything because unless there are a large number of illegal aliens working at one place, they don't care. Meaning that all the illegal aliens have to do is work 5-10 people to a job and not worry about getting caught. We need to get more stricter about this. We can't just let these small pockets off illegal aliens get away because there are many small pockets making a large population of illegal aliens.","top-ten-reasons-close-americas-border","06:47 PM","government-debates","18"

"08-16-2004","2798",2,"georged","None","Here's a brief consideration for the issue of closing our borders US/Canadian land border - 3,145 miles, mostly subjected to harsh winter weather conditions. US/Mexican land border - 2,000 miles of desert heat. I no longer have the links, but a couple of individuals on other forums did the calculations on what it would logistically require in the way of personnel, transportation and logistics to seal those borders 24/7/365.

Plus all the rest. Then come the Atantic and Pacific Oceans, Gulf of Mexico and Bering Sea. Talk is always cheap, many seem to believe our current pathetic efforts would stop a dedicated terrorist, but why not continue to ignore our foreign policy that invites retaliation? We're already spending $50-billion a year on Homeland Security. Seal the borders and just put it on the national credit card in the name of preserving Democracy?","Bush Is The Man","62423","First of all, how do you figure it costs the government $250,000 a year per troop? Did you just make it up? They make no more than $50,000 in salary, where does the other $200,000 come from? I'm anxious to know...does each troop get a new lamborghini each year? The salaries for someone in the military for FY2003 was from $27,000 to $80,000. Obviously nobody working the border is going to be making $80,000. This salary ALSO INCLUDES BASE PAY, AVERAGE HOUSING ALLOWANCE, MONETARY FOOD ALLOWANCE, AND THE ""TAX ADVANTAGE"" OF UNTAXED ALLOWANCE. So, the average salary for someone working the border is probably around $45,000. According to your figures, whether they are correct or not, here would be the cost: Canada Border- 3145 miles * 17 troops per mile=53,465 troops 53,465*$45,000=$2.4 billion Mexico Border- 2000 miles * 17 troops per mile=34,000 troops 34,000*$45,000=$1.5 billion The support personnel cover for the shifts. They don't just hire 3 sets of people to work each location. And not all of them work at the same time. Usually one person is on duty and rotates between the 4 soldiers. Only in a time of extreme crisis would you have all the soldiers at their post at the same time? Where do you get the notion that there are 3 support ratios for each troop? I disagree with that claim. Even going with you claim, here would be the cost: 87,465 troops * 4 support=349,860 support troops 349,860 support troops + 87,465 troops=437,325 troops 437,325 troops * $45,000 salary=$20 billion That comes out to $20 billion in salary. Where does the other $240 billion come from? http://usmilitary.about.com/library/...stedsalary.htm Look at it this way. Over 16,000 Mexicans illegally come through the Mexico/USA border each week. In 1 year, that's alomst 1million. Factor in that they have one of the highest numbers of children as an ethnicity, and you have the makings for them taking over the USA ILLEGALLY at an astronomical rate!!! That means the US citizens are losing the opportunity on over 832,000 jobs a year. Why are people complaining about the government not offering more jobs, and then complaining that we need to let Mexicans in? They are taking the jobs!! Think about Iraq. We have 160,000 troops there. If they had 4 support personnel, that would mean we had 800,000 total troops there, which we don't. Then factor in your claim that they need 3 shifts, we would have 1.2 million troops there. Get real!","top-ten-reasons-close-americas-border","11:26 AM","government-debates","20"

This will greatly expedite the holding process. Border Patrol: Recently several prominent political strategists have suggested using existing US military resources to back up the current border patrol officers. This idea would not only take advantage of the superior hardware that the military possesses but would also utilize the additional manpower and command and control apparatus. With the recently announced realignment of US forces this option is increasingly feasible. Criminal Detention Facilities: This is an irrelevant issue regarding the border debate from your side. If you wish to bring this point up you should point out that illegal immigrants also commit crimes just like anyone else and end up costing tax payers money in the court/prison system. Economy: If illegal immigrants stopped flowing in then the market would raise payrolls at the lowest levels. As a business professional I understand that if you need a position filled but can't find suitable applicants at the current pay level then you must raise the compensation to compete with market demand. As far as the economy going broke in order to fill low wage jobs, if you take away government handouts without some proof of employment people would have to take those jobs. My Stand: I believe in a closed border in the sense that we should keep out illegal immigrants. Legal immigrants should always be welcome in America as long as they complete IN FULL all the legal requirements to get a visa/citizenship. Granted this is a long and costly process, but those individuals who complete this are less likely to end up in a low income job increasingly looking to the government for substinence. I welcome the cultural diversity that has made this nation a great ""melting pot."" Illegal immigration is a threat and a crime against all American citizens. I personally am against my tax dollars going to illegals through public services that they are able to take advantage of without paying a dime. The idea of an open border is insane to fiscally responsible American citizens who respect the laws and rules of this great nation.","top-ten-reasons-close-americas-border","11:30 AM","government-debates","21"

I spent many years as a business professional and still keep myself involved at a consulting level. In this era I have yet to hear of laborer, unskilled or semi-skilled jobs going unfilled due to a lack of qualified applicants. As a business person I would think you'd be aware that we're involved in a world economy, not a self-contained capsule to maintain a standard of living applicable to only US citizens. While that's certainly a very patriotic attitude, I see it as having no basis of reality. Any manager outside of a government entity or academia is charged with the responsibility of operating a business unit that achieves the lowest cost of goods sold within established standards. That doesn't include involving patriotism or social engineering. If labor is available at X cost and the supply is adequate, demand will be filled. If not, then one acquires the labor from a different geographical location before increasing labor costs and disrupting the business plan and profit margins. If, as in the case of customer service, professional support personnel, accounting, etc. that means utilizing labor from another country with the aid of data transfer, so be it. In the instance of illegal immigrants from Mexico, you're seeing true economic supply and demand at work. The only difference between now and when we were desperate for labor and legally allowed commerce to establish immigration quotas is that many lower and middle-class US citizens were spoiled by our past economic success and refuse to admit that their unskilled and semi-skilled positions are no longer worth double or triple what someone else will work for in current economic conditions. As to the current sentiment against illegal immigration, it has been a tide since the 1990s. Our foreign policy, the resulting 9/11 incident and threat of additional retaliation by 'terrorists' slipping over our borders was carefully exploited to further condition Americans in their escape from reality. Now they have someone else to blame for our deteriorating economic condition, loss of jobs and destructive foreign policy. Refocus has become an important government management tool. My remark using criminal prison population problems in conjunction with immigration detention logistics was meant to point out the fact that we have serious problems in all phases of attempting to establish a semi-isolationist state of mind.","top-ten-reasons-close-americas-border","05:30 PM","government-debates","22"

I realise that a totally open border is ridiculous, but that wasn't my point. All I was noting was that as a country that was founded on the notion of free and open immigration actually not only has some of the strictest immigration laws, but a very large proportion appearing to say it needs to be stricter. I don't really mean to comment that this is right or wrong, but just that I find it very ironic.","top-ten-reasons-close-americas-border","07:35 AM","government-debates","23"
