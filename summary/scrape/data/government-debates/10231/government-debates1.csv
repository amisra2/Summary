The language is very crude so be forewarned but the reality of the picture he paints is undeniable and only getting more grim as time goes by. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KVTfcAyYGg What is most unnerving is that it really doesn't matter if the Democrats or Republicans are in power anymore because I think they are both being controlled by these powers that be. I fear the common man, the backbone of our reason for existing as a Nation have become irrelavent pawns in the game the rich play to attain more personal power.

This isn't an American dilemma only, but a Global one. If you agree on that level then we do agree for once.","scary-message-george-carlin","05:49 PM","government-debates","3"

The rot started here when Thatcher came to power, and became chronic when Neil Kinnock became leader of the Labour party. Now we have two parties in hock to corporate interests, and even if another party did get elected, their hands are tied because of the reaction of the financial markets. The actions of the ECB in bailing out hedge funds is a sign of how bad it has got. I think we'd best not discuss the solution otherwise we'll start to disagree again. George Monbiot has the beginnings of a plan in his book Age of Consent. I'm quite surprised you agree with what is an essentially marxist analysis of the situation though.","scary-message-george-carlin","05:57 PM","government-debates","4"

Any freethinking person, whether socialist or conservative, will come to the conclusion that the current system of megacorporations benefitting from government largesse is the worst we can have. I myself am a capitalist and a conservative, but when I look at the corporatism that's running rampant I just shudder. The system we have today has nothing to do with capitalism or free markets and it only serves the ultra wealthy who get special benefits from the government. Take for example the current subprime meltdown. So a lot of stupid rich people invested their money poorly and now the central banks (Fed, ECB etc.) have to bail them out? How stupid is that? If they invested in the wrong things they should lose their money, period. That's how capitalism works. No more billion dollar bailouts financed by the public, that has to stop. If you or I invested our money poorly we don't get our money back from the government, so why should they? It always makes me laugh when people talk about democracy and freedom of choice because frankly we don't have it. What we have is corporatism which is basically just another word for fascism.","scary-message-george-carlin","05:23 AM","government-debates","5"

That's the whole reason why things have become as bad as they are right now. To regulate and control corporations you need a big government and big government is part of the problem. If the government didn't have any loot to spread around, then the corporations wouldn't lobby to get some of that and there would be no corporatism. The bigger the government and the more control they have of the markets, the less freedoms you have and the more corporations will get in bed with the government to get special perks. You would trust the Bush administration to run the economy and decide which corporations get regulated?","scary-message-george-carlin","05:58 AM","government-debates","7"

The American dream is the archetype of false class consciousness, it makes people plan a tax policy on the basis of the day they are rich.","scary-message-george-carlin","06:17 AM","government-debates","8"

Nothing I or George said supported or endorsed Marxism at all. What is happening today is more diabolical than anything that has ever happened in the World before in that very shortly, if not now, the combined Corporate Wealth of the entire Planet can be traced back to being owned and controlled by one of approximitely 7 Mega-Corporations. The day is quickly coming, if it isn't already here when the only independant companies that exist, exist because the conglomerates aren't interested in their type of Industry, YET.","scary-message-george-carlin","08:07 AM","government-debates","9"

Demand the government increasingly regulate and control who can make money. 2.

If you reduce the power of the government to regulate the way businesses act not only it would let companies embark in the use of predatory practices against each other but also it would foster fraud, tax evasion etc You would end up with monopolies, or price fixing deals when only two players remained such as two airlines, two telecommunication companies etc for it is easier to share the market than compete.

We need non-predatory practices, like getting the government to shut down and impede your competitors while subsidising your business with the tax dollars and freshly minted money! Chinese businesses are employing such predatory practices right now, ""dumping"" cheap goods on American consumers. This is bad for the economy, and bad for the people! We need more regulation to stop these predatory goods entering hardworking american soil, so that non-predatory, taxpayer funded american corporations can get their fair share!","scary-message-george-carlin","08:50 AM","government-debates","12"
"08-14-2007","10231",1,"None","None","None","Archangel","278237","Back in the late 80s and early 90s Canada went after the American Lumber Industry by subsidizing Canadian Lumber Companies and were so successful at undercutting American retail wood prices that in just a few years took over the Lumber Industry by forcing the American suppliers out of bussiness. Of course they no longer subsidize Canadian Lumber and we Americans pay much higher prices than we would if our Government had just protected that Industry from foriegn competition in the first place. It must also be noted that at the time that the Canadian Government was doing this market manipulation by artificially absorbing the extra cost Canadian Companies spent in order to compete with the more efficient American Companies, this whole subsidizing scheme was exposed by the American Manufacturers, fought in Courts and disallowed by our own Government which claimed it was just part of the free enterprise system game. This is just one example of how many foriegn Industries have been allowed to come into the US and steal jobs with the help of Government subsidies while our Government did nothing to protect the American worker or the American Industry itself. You would think that Anti-trust laws would protect us from these monetary foriegn invasions but this aspect of the internationalization of the lumber industry is a prime example of what has happened in most every, if not evey Major Industry on Earth today.","scary-message-george-carlin","09:13 AM","government-debates","13"

The truth is that class is more fixed in the UK and Europe than it has been in decades, the Thatcherite and Reganite economic policies have led to a huge decline is social mobility and an increasing gap between rich and poor. At least the 19th century tory paternalists had some notion of responsibility to their workforces, leading to the establishment of places like Saltaire and Bournville.

Under Reagans watch the American middle class leaped forward by huge strides economically as did the lower echelons of the wage earning public. Prior to him, the dems had such high taxes on the lower income Americans that the economy was sluggish and even stagnent. Reagan immediately dropped all income taxes on low income wage earners, lowered them on middle income wage earners and raised them to an accross the board 35% to the higher income wage earners over 100,000 dollars a year. He cancelled the luxury tac that the dems created that prevented the wealthy from buying luxury items like boats and second homes and got the economy moving again.That created job growth and economic growth as the trickle down economics meant the wealthy spent more money and the middle class prospered tremendously from this. Jobs were created and viola, the economy was booming once again. It was under Clinton that high paying jobs were lost to foriegn Countries and Americans had to replace their one good job with 3 lousy paying ones in order to survive. I'll never forget seeing a yuppie looking guy driving a new Jaguar around town with a Domino's Pizza sign on his roof delivering pizzas. I'll also never forget when Clinton came on TV towards the end of his second term when he was closing down 40 Military Bases around the Country. He had so little respect for the American peoples intelligence that in the same speech he had the nerve to say that he was closing these bases in order to save the Government 40 billion dollars a year in overhead costs to keep them running but sadly he had to announce a tax increase to cover the cost of closing the Bases. Now tell me folks, If closing the bases is going to save us 40 billion a year then why do we need a tax increase to cover the cost of the closings ? Does that make any more sense today than it made then ? I think not.","scary-message-george-carlin","10:08 AM","government-debates","15"
