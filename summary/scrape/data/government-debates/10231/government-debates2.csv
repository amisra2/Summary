I actually started replying to that post. Then it dawned on me that to draft a reply that explained the economic fallicies there would take quite a while, and that anybody who could possibly belive the fallicies put forth probably could not understand it anyway...so I stopped.","scary-message-george-carlin","05:00 PM","government-debates","17"

To regulate and control corporations you need a big government and big government is part of the problem. If the government didn't have any loot to spread around, then the corporations wouldn't lobby to get some of that and there would be no corporatism. The bigger the government and the more control they have of the markets, the less freedoms you have and the more corporations will get in bed with the government to get special perks. You would trust the Bush administration to run the economy and decide which corporations get regulated?","Matthew S","278385","Corporations are the problem. They only have concern for profit and anything that gets in their way they will shove aside, be it workers, or the enviornment.","scary-message-george-carlin","08:25 PM","government-debates","18"

That's the whole idea of entrepeneurialship. Not to be a social-welfare agency at the behest of the government. But a private sector business whose sole aim is to make money. Now, how do I see this situation? Pathetic, to say the least. Yes, I know (Daewoo), I have posted otherwise, but as I see just how cozy corperations have gotten with government *ahem, cough, cough-Bass Pro-cough, hack, wheeze* I'm taking a different look at it.","scary-message-george-carlin","10:00 PM","government-debates","20"

I really have nothing against the whole idea of entrepeneurialship. I think it is wonderful that we live in a country where you can go out and start a business and mke your own way in the world. My problem is when the rights and welfare of people are cast aside for profit that is when business has over stepped and needs to checked. I think it is wrong and evil for a company to uproot and move manufacturing to other countries just to save money on wages. When someone works for you, you have an ethical obligation to take care of them. They are giving you their lives, sweat, tears, and loyalty, to produce something for you, you can not just throw that away. Without that worker you could not produce that product. You are living off the sweat and produce of others. Isn't it you that said that it is not right to take from those that have to give to those who will not work?","scary-message-george-carlin","11:50 PM","government-debates","21"

Hence the need for regulations and controls. We need protection from them. Unfortunately money is a powerful tool in their arsenal and everything and everybody that can be bought to further their interests is bought if for sale. Look at the lobbyists in the American Congress they have more influence in the laws passed in there than the voters. They bankroll the politician electoral campaigns and get a nice return for their investment.","scary-message-george-carlin","12:24 AM","government-debates","22"

But it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance."" ~ Murray N Rothbard. In other words, is it possible for posters here to put at least basic research into these kinds of issues before spouting off whatever they picked up on Fox News or The Socialist League of Gay Gentlemen website. I would like to respond directly with an argument, but the sheer volume of garbage being passed off without any justification makes such an effort impossible. I don't know how to respond to someone's opinion on international trade when they apparently have no grasp of supply and demand. At least when creationists head over to argue about evolution, they tend to understand that things have genes, and that these genes are inherited. But people for some reason feel qualified to give their opinion on relatively complex matters of economics without knowing anything about it other than what they read in a fictional text. Try Reading Adam Smith - The Wealth of Nations David Ricardo - Principles of Political Economy and Taxation Frederic Bastiat - Economic Sophisms John Maynard Keynes - The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. Murry N Rothbard - Man, Economy and State Milton Friedman - Capitalism and Freedom Karl Marx - Capital You can see whose arguments you find compelling and whose not. There are many others worth reading too, but that should give you a general overview of the sorts of ideas flying around, instead of simply adopting some kind of half assed protectionist-keynesian-labour-theory-of-value drivel. I respect that opinions differ, but I have no respect for the kind of argument that grows from not actually bothering to do any research.","scary-message-george-carlin","12:50 AM","government-debates","23"

If you try and make anything but the most general statements about economics you're liable to end up with egg on your face. I don't consider economics to be the ""dismal science"" because that would require me to consider it to be science. As I recall didn't even Adam Smith, totem of the free marketeers, recommend that corporations be tightly controlled?","scary-message-george-carlin","07:00 AM","government-debates","25"

The classical economists were also adherents of the labour theory of value, roughly speaking, Marx was building on this aspect of their work, taking it to its logical conclusion. At virtually the same time as this, Carl Menger was publishing the refutation of this theory of value, and instead grounding economics on the subjectivity of value and in the process resolving a whole lot of paradoxes that the classical view entailed. The phrase ""dismal science"" which you will find today employed by a swathe of journalists ignorant of its origins, was coined by Thomas Carlyle in his book, ""occassional discourse on the negro question"", in which he rejected the position the classical economists took in favour of a free market in labour, arguing that slavery would benefit the people of the west indies by facilitating better regulation of labour. I agree that econometrics as a basis for economic theory is unjustified and rests on a large number of unwarranted assumptions.","scary-message-george-carlin","07:50 AM","government-debates","26"
