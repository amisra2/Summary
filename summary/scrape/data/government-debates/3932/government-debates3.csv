"12-17-2004","3932",3,"Alan Ryan","None","Even, in the period 1919-1941 when American attitudes to the world were considered to be strongly isolationist this was not quite the case. In fact the USA was inclined more to isolation within its own hemisphere than to global detachment. During that period when keeping European affairs at a distance, the US paid close attention to what was going on (combined sometimes with interference) in the rest of the Americas.","georged","83160","That period also saw substantial capital investment in Europe, including Germany, by American individuals and companies, without political consideration or interference.","isolationism","11:16 AM","government-debates","32"

Some US international economic endeavors are now extensions of foreign policy using military support, as in the ME with Israel and Iraq. WW2 and our resulting military power, constantly utilized, placed us at a long distance from political isolation.","isolationism","12:39 PM","government-debates","35"
