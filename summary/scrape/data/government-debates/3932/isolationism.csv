We can't afford it. Our industrial infrastructure is in such poor shape that we cannot break off from the rest of the world. We do not even make tool steel int he US anymore, and without tool steel you can have no industry. If, by isolationism, you mean not constantly using our military to advance idiotic idealogical viewpoints, or useing our military as a tool of trade policy, I would certianly agree this idea has its merits. I would also agree that, if by isolationism, you mean no longer supporting evil dicatators and tyrants, I am certianly behind this 100%. Maybe you could be a little more specific about what type of isolationism you are talking here.","isolationism","01:29 PM","government-debates","2"

We do not produce enough farm machinery in this nation to quite buying it abroad, and we do not have the industrial infrastructure to ramp up production to meet current needs. The same is true of most other products we see on todays markets. If we had adopted a policy of isolationism years ago, this might be different, but we didn't and we are where we are in this regard.","isolationism","11:41 AM","government-debates","5"

Canada would win by being the nice and polite hosts that we are.

Isolation with Canada as a partner certainly seems workable, as is the inevitable Western Hemisphere alliance. It would take some time to eliminate inbred US racism, but perhaps your native population could be given gambling rights in designated major US cities as a trade deficit allowance for your oil and food products. We used another method to appease original native populations here and in parts of S. America, but that doesn't seem feasible in your country and our current methodolgy using low casuality mass destruction for political purposes is probably out of the question.","isolationism","09:11 PM","government-debates","13"

We're stuck with using public debt to churn the economy, what's rapidly becoming obsolete manufacturing capabilities and need the foreign military expenditures to polish the GDP, so economic isolation is not a viable option. Immigration, legal or otherwise, will continue as long as our neighbors are starving and Americans consider many jobs below their stations in life.
