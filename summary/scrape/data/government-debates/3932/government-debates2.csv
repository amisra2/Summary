Someone advocating the elimination of immigration and espousing the logic of ""caucasian pride"" worries me. I must be paranoid. This country practiced isolationism during our greatest periods of immigration.","isolationism","01:32 PM","government-debates","22"

We're stuck with using public debt to churn the economy, what's rapidly becoming obsolete manufacturing capabilities and need the foreign military expenditures to polish the GDP, so economic isolation is not a viable option. Immigration, legal or otherwise, will continue as long as our neighbors are starving and Americans consider many jobs below their stations in life. Our national guard is fully occupied with instilling democracy in Iraq.","isolationism","01:53 PM","government-debates","23"

Iraq? Afghanistan? Do you think we could afford to build schools if we cut off most of our foreign trade? Anything could use the money we are wasting in Iraq. That's one of the reasons to be against the war. Too late to bitch, o well.","isolationism","07:59 PM","government-debates","25"
"12-16-2004","3932",2,"Dzeron","None","I think we should work to defend existing democracies, not create new ones. That was our principle in WW1 and WW2. We should stop militaristic dictators from taking over democratic countries, but we should leave the rise of democracy to internal revolutions.","pnac=ww3","83059","I think the principle in WWII was survival. Japan attacked us and then Germany seized the opportunity and declared war on us a few days later.","isolationism","08:00 PM","government-debates","26"

Direct attacks requiring defense as I understood the constitution. Now all it takes is a quick wave of the flag and we invade countries for their resources who don't stand a military chance in heck against us. Strong indications of desperation aren't comforting in these times. We may get isolation.","isolationism","09:31 PM","government-debates","27"

Waxy","Alan Ryan","83156","Even, in the period 1919-1941 when American attitudes to the world were considered to be strongly isolationist this was not quite the case. In fact the USA was inclined more to isolation within its own hemisphere than to global detachment. During that period when keeping European affairs at a distance, the US paid close attention to what was going on (combined sometimes with interference) in the rest of the Americas.","isolationism","11:08 AM","government-debates","30"
