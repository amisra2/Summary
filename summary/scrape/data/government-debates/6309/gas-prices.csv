The inability of Americans to work together as a whole is dumbfounding. Our collective ""bi-polar"" disorder has set our nation poles apart on our views and opinions that is unprecidented. Dream, if you will, of Americans pulling together for a common cause. When you are finished having yourself a hardy laugh at this next to impossible idea, consider this. High gas prices are OUR fault. They are not the republicans or the democrats or Bush's fault. It is OUR fault. The gas prices are skyhigh because they KNOW we will pay it. We may gripe about it, but nobody I know intends on cutting back or protesting. Protesting, you ask? How? We have to get to work. That takes cars. That takes gasoline. This mentality has us all by the balls. But there IS a way. And it's so simple, you are going to be disappointed you didn't figure this out for yourself. I know I am. Obviously, we need gasoline regardless of the cost. So, how do we protest? How can we possibly boycott? Are you ready for the simple solution? If EVERYONE would refuse to buy gasoline from the top two oil companies, perhaps Mobile and Exxon, and buy our gas elsewhere, eventually the top two oil companies will be FORCED to cut their prices. Then comes the following competition. Gas prices will inevitably drop. Meanwhile, our gas tanks remained full and we made it to our jobs just the same. It wouldn't take 60 days for us to correct this problem ourselves. But the idea of getting America rowing the same boat in the same direction is next to a fantasy.","gas-prices","01:52 PM","government-debates","3"

Your suggestion besides being socialistic in nature would only serve to reduce supply without reducing demand. Government involvement in setting a ""fair profit"" is antithetical to our market system except in rare instances. The fact that our individual consumption has gone up lately along with increased international(China) competition for existing production of crude has brought us here.

Taking the lead additive out of gasoline some 30+ years ago meant that we now get less gasoline from a barrel of oil than we used to, and there are more low-sulfur regs coming soon that will reduce the gasoline per barrel of crude by another 3% to 5%. We haven't built a new refinery for almost 30 years and the ones we do have, have been operating at 98.5% of capacity. That means that even one unit in one refinery going down for maintenance reduces the supply of gasoline. And that's before Katrina wiped out a bunch of refineries on the Gulf Coast. There's a group in Arizona that has been trying since 1999 to get the permits to build another refinery, but they aren't there yet. Borrowing crude from the Strategic Reserve won't help as long as there is no way to refine it. Another problem is that the refineries have to produce a boutique of gasoline formulations for different areas of the country at different times of the year - and the courts have ruled that EPA doesn't have to consider costs when they emit their regulations. Bottom line: EPA is enforcing conservation by forcing the people to make hard choices about whether they really need to drive somewhere by raising the prices.

The key words are ""open market"", and it's a GLOBAL market, the NYSE plays a big part, but the world can and will go on without it. ""Oil company profits"" are controlled by the price of oil, oil companies have no control on the price of oil , so laying the current high prices at the feet of the oil companies and villainizing them for making profits is ridiculous and shows a lack of understanding of how the economy actually works. The USA is not capable of standing alone as far as oil reserves are concerned. Simply put, the USA is NOT capable of producing enough oil to meet its consumption, nor will it likely ever be. The simple fact is, there's not a darn thing Bush, Congress, or any gov't agency can do control the price of oil, even if they did decide to enact some type of communist law regarding the control of the free market. Sure the Iraq war isn't helping, but you're looking to place the blame on the wrong people. You have identified who the real culprits are, you just haven't realized.

Even Saudi Arabia has pledged to increase production by 1.5 million barrels per day in direct response to Katrina. We will have adequate supplies of crude throughout this ordeal. It is the ability to convert this crude into auto-quality gasoline that we are going to be short on.

"09-03-2005","6309",6,"Diogenes99","None","The deregulation was for wholesale prices only, and affects only sales from one electric retailer to another. On the retail level, prices are regulated by the state government. Very true. Bureaucrats are the least efficient critters to bring services to the public, as history has demonstrated every time socialism has been tried. The lotus eaters in the environmental movement have been very successful in guiding us back toward the stone age. There is plenty of demand, and there are plenty of people willing to supply the needs; unfortunately there are also plenty of tree-huggers ready to torpedo any project on environmental grounds rooted in fantasy. Dead wrong. There has never been another society as compassionate or as successful as the US in lifting people out of poverty and misery.","georged","159081","Deregulated wholesale price plus overhead equals retail price, electricity being no different than a retail gasoline station. State regulation is a sham and perpetuation of an expensive, useless bureaucracy. CA proved state regulation means zip. Markets now determine electrical pricing, not bureaucracies. For those who haven't noticed, the US is now part of the global community for better or worse. Investment capital is unavailable for US electrical power generation simply because power can be purchased from Canada for less than new US production costs. There is a factor called ROI in the real world and capital flight is no different between electricity and other US manufacturing entities. Political rants mean little to money as money has no friends or loyalty. Government compassion in the US for poor people? That sounds like a statement from someone who thinks he/she is following the American Dream through irresponsible spending and indebtedness and believes every shred of propaganda issued by all political administrations. There has never been but one area of concern for true financial gain in the US and it has never included anyone from the lower or middle classes for purposes of anything other than maintaining civil stability and providing labor. Those classes did greatly benefit in a flow-through manner during our recent period of great prosperity due to work force requirements, but I suggest you examine conditions prior to ww2 and visit contemporary current inner-cities, depressed rural areas and charity food operations prior to preaching abundance of compassion.","gas-prices","09:10 AM","government-debates","76"

With one act of congress and the presidents signature they could enact an act making it illegal to 1 speculate on the price of oil and 2 by stating that oil will not be sold over 25 or 30 dollars per barrel within the US.

I don't know anyone putting their money in US long-term syndication on the equity side not associated with health care real property and a petrochemical plant can be a 40-year useful life situation. What's your take on the US economy in 5, 10 and 20+ years? Good enough to put up the money for what may well be surplus refining capacity before useful life term is reached?

Eliminate US government economic forecasters, brokerage/bank economic forecasters and all other economic forecasters with a product to peddle that requires consumer confidence and I'd be interested in a link. Here's a little blurb from Matthew Simmons (energy advisor for Dick Cheney): "" there is not one serious economist in this world who would say that you can have significant economic growth without the availability of cheap energy."" Simmons rules out the possibility of cheap energy coming decades. When asked if there is a solution to the impending energy crisis he said : ""I don't think there is one. The solution is to pray. Under the best of circumstances, if all prayers are answered there will be no crisis for maybe two years. After that it's a certainty."" Here's a little fact for those who feel oil prices will come down: At present rates of consumption the US will be importing 90% of oil requirements by 2020. We're using the easy to get (cheap) stuff now. But the oil that remains is going to be increasingly expensive to produce and it will tend to be of a lesser quality, necessitating higher refining costs, than what has already been used. All of those costs will have to be passed on in the form of price hikes or -- in some cases -- spikes.
