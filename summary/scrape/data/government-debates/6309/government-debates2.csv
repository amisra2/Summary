When I went to the pumps yesterday it was about 89.5p a litre, which is about $1.64 a litre. Which is about $6.21 a gallon(US). That is assuming that(and my figures and calculations may be incorrect ) 1 = $1.8 1 gallon(US) = 3.785 litres I think there would be a riot in the US if gas prices where that high.","gas-prices","05:52 PM","government-debates","16"
"08-31-2005","6309",2,"Matthew S","None","No I am serious. What you all don't realize is that oil is sold in an open market and the market is located in New York City. Which last I checked was with in the United States. Also what you don't realize is that the US is still one of the worlds largest producers of oil. If congress and the president were really concerned about the average american they would do something. ahhh but thats it they are republicans and don't care about people. What is more important the oil companies profits or the effect high gas prices have on the low to middle income families?","JPSartre12","158398","Do me a favor. Instead of parotting liberal claptrap, do some research like I did. Here are the % Profits for various industries: Oil Industry 8.9% Software and related 16% Pharmaceuticals 20.4% Banking 20.8% Who's taking who to the cleaners?","gas-prices","06:54 PM","government-debates","17"
"08-31-2005","6309",2,"None","None","None","Eddie","158414","Actually, it would be quite possible for the US congress to lower the price on gas through subsidies, or direct price control. However, if the gas is subsidized it will just mean a distribution of resources from the taxpayers to the gas producers and high consumers (with efficency losses to boot). If direct price control would be enacted, the result would be a drop in supply and an increase in demand, resulting in an impressive gas shortage...","gas-prices","07:20 PM","government-debates","18"

I really believe that.","Waxy","158419","Then - #1 - You don't understand how the oil business works. #2 - You don't care about those that would be adversely affected (at least in the short term) by such a plan.

There are some advantages of living in a country like Venezuela where the State Oil company refines the Oil, and the Government keeps the prices low.

The good point about rising gas prices is that the higher they go, the higher the demand for hybrids and other cars that get great mpg. So long SUVs and the aggressive soccer-mom b*tches that drive them! And people, come on...the national average is $3 a gallon or so. It's not a big deal. Once the problem stabilizes, the gas prices go down again. Simple economics.","gas-prices","11:01 PM","government-debates","25"

They could set price controlls and say to the gas companies that you must sell gasoiline and you will only sell it for say 1.50 per gallon. If the oil companies don't like it there is always nationalisation of the oil indrustry. Why can no one see that we aready set price controlls on electricity. Oil and gas are no different. I still contend crongress does not want to take action. They do not care about the american people.","gas-prices","08:59 AM","government-debates","28"
"09-01-2005","6309",2,"None","None","None","Symbiote","158502","gee price controls on petrol, where have I heard that one before? Oh that's right, the petroleum price controls back in the 70s, back when politicians cared about people and didn't just come out with economically suicidal policies that catered to the lowest common denominator's half baked ideas about greedy oil merchants. Oh and in Iraq, where the American administration truly cares about the people - they have price controls on their petrol. In fact, if politicians truly cared about the people, they'd go all the way, and declare a price ceiling of 0 on all goods and services. Then scarcity would be abolished and we could all have as much of everything as we all desired.","gas-prices","09:08 AM","government-debates","29"

Right now we are at roughly $3 per gallon You want to go to $1.50 per gallon, a 50% cut, when the supplier is only making an 8.5% profit? Why woudl anybody be iwlling to produce gas at a 41.5% loss? We would then have NO GAS.","gas-prices","09:53 AM","government-debates","30"
