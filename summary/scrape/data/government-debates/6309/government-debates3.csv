They could set price controlls and say to the gas companies that you must sell gasoiline and you will only sell it for say 1.50 per gallon. If the oil companies don't like it there is always nationalisation of the oil indrustry. Why can no one see that we aready set price controlls on electricity. Oil and gas are no different. I still contend crongress does not want to take action. They do not care about the american people.","Waxy","158552","Stop talking blindly and actually think about it Matthew S. What you're suggesting doesn't even remotely make sense. It's beyond reality. Why would any company, or any individual for that matter, produce a product at a loss? Do you actually think a national oil company would solve the problem? Look at the job the US government is doing now? Does that paint a rosy picture of good management and prosperity for you? (not a slam, I wouldn't want a nationalized oil company in Canada either) Why don't you actually think for yourself and act for yourself, rather than blame everything on the ""uncaring"" government, while at the same time, expecting that same government to hold your hand and magically solve all your problems. You're a big boy, deal with it. Waxy","gas-prices","11:57 AM","government-debates","31"
"09-01-2005","6309",3,"Symbiote","None","gee price controls on petrol, where have I heard that one before? Oh that's right, the petroleum price controls back in the 70s, back when politicians cared about people and didn't just come out with economically suicidal policies that catered to the lowest common denominator's half baked ideas about greedy oil merchants. Oh and in Iraq, where the American administration truly cares about the people - they have price controls on their petrol. In fact, if politicians truly cared about the people, they'd go all the way, and declare a price ceiling of 0 on all goods and services. Then scarcity would be abolished and we could all have as much of everything as we all desired.","JPSartre12","158555","Yeah, I remember the last time that Uncle Sam stuck its nose in the gas arena. I waited in long lines at the gas pump too many times for my liking. Cruel gov't is making me work to support myself instead of giving me enough money to retire at age 49. And it would be so easy for them to support all of us. After all, they control the money printing presses. All they need to do is print more money, right?","gas-prices","12:11 PM","government-debates","32"

All OPEC oil would then be traded at the London Petroleum exchange and the soon to be opened Iranian Oil Bourse, leaving the US with nothing.

How many troops would be required to nationalize Canada and OPEC nations? Oil and gas are commodities priced on global demand. We currently import 60% of our oil from other countries and consume 25% of world oil production. China and India would immediately pay market price for any futures we reject for price control purposes and we'd be 60% short on oil while domestic oil companies tanked.","gas-prices","12:46 PM","government-debates","35"

This is not comparative with the average prices in the US. The individuals involved with this price gouging will be dealt with, rest assured. The big question is how long will it take for the prices to go back down after the damage to the refineries is fixed? They say that some of the refineries could take up to 2 months to fix, which could mean prices in the 3 dollar range for a while. I would bet we will see over $4 before this is all over. As well, I have seen some people thinking that the release of oil from the reserves will drive down prices. This is a rediculous notion. We are not short of crude. Even Saudi Arabia has pledged to increase production by 1.5 million barrels per day in direct response to Katrina. We will have adequate supplies of crude throughout this ordeal. It is the ability to convert this crude into auto-quality gasoline that we are going to be short on. So releasing it from reserves will assure that it is available, but it will be refined at a slower rate. Not to mention, the oil that the companies are borrowing from the reserves, will have to be replaced at a later date.","gas-prices","12:55 PM","government-debates","36"
"09-01-2005","6309",3,"None","None","None","Ghost","158602","The funny thing is that Mat is suggesting the government essentially take control of the oil industry...but then he'd be complaining about that, too. What we need to do isn't lower the prices. Prices go up because our supply has gone down and our demand has gone up (people wanting to fill up before we're out). If we can increase supply, such as releasing some oil from our reserve (already being done), and stepping up refinement into gasoline (also being done), then pretty soon the prices should stabilize. Once everything along the gulf gets straightened out and starts working again, then prices should come down.","gas-prices","02:17 PM","government-debates","37"

Refinement capacity is maxed out, even with the new Saud financed East Coast refinery. No plans for additional refining capacity as that's a 20-year amortization investment and US oil demand will drop long before adequate ROI on such an investment is realized. Now that commodity markets have experienced what a natural disaster can actually do to supply, I wouldn't expect any decrease in oil futures for any reason. Quite the opposite. Add the expected drop in USD valuation everyone in the financial world is poised for and cheap gasoline is just another part of historical US prosperity. But don't let the general public know or consumer confidence may take a nosedive and then we'll have serious problems. Gotta be tough peddling big SUVs after I watched gasoline in my city jump $.35/gal in 48 hours with more to come.","gas-prices","07:43 PM","government-debates","40"
"09-01-2005","6309",3,"sinjin","None","Increasing supply or reducing demand would bring down the price. Your suggestion besides being socialistic in nature would only serve to reduce supply without reducing demand. Government involvement in setting a ""fair profit"" is antithetical to our market system except in rare instances. The fact that our individual consumption has gone up lately along with increased international(China) competition for existing production of crude has brought us here. Sooner or later oil will stay high and then what? Maybe we should consider driving cars that don't weigh what elephants weigh. Maybe we should design hybrid tanks.","Bassman","158748","I have stated in another thread that the left-wing environmetalist agenda has been successful in establishing laws that do not allow new exploration and drilling. In addition, there has not been a new refinery built in 25 years. I have also asserted that these so-called ""alternative"" fuels cannot realize the savings for at least 50+ years. We do not have the time to play games with the ""new"" energy sources.
