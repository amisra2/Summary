Please include commodity market response and how such a declaration would impact the USD.","Matthew S","158769","Intresting how you ignor the electricity issue. The companies would find a way to make a profit they always do. OF course I don't have any figures to back up my claims as you well knew. Rising gas prices hurt the poorest among us it is the governments responsiblity to help those in the most need. That is unless as many republicans believe that people should fend for themselves and if they die so what. If they are poor so what.","gas-prices","09:21 PM","government-debates","46"
"09-01-2005","6309",4,"snakespit","None","The big question is how long will it take for the prices to go back down after the damage to the refineries is fixed? They say that some of the refineries could take up to 2 months to fix, which could mean prices in the 3 dollar range for a while. I would bet we will see over $4 before this is all over. As well, I have seen some people thinking that the release of oil from the reserves will drive down prices. This is a rediculous notion. We are not short of crude. Even Saudi Arabia has pledged to increase production by 1.5 million barrels per day in direct response to Katrina. We will have adequate supplies of crude throughout this ordeal. It is the ability to convert this crude into auto-quality gasoline that we are going to be short on. So releasing it from reserves will assure that it is available, but it will be refined at a slower rate. Not to mention, the oil that the companies are borrowing from the reserves, will have to be replaced at a later date.","georged","158771","$4/gal is, where I live (OR), within easy reach. Today we hit $3.50/gal all over town for premium using California refinery products. That's $.30/gal since Monday, all at once. No gouging, just the effect of commodity trading trickling down to consumer level. Asians and Europeans who read these posts have to find some humor in our 'predicament'.","gas-prices","09:23 PM","government-debates","47"

How many people actually drive in Iraq. Could there be a supply & demand thing going on. They have more oil over their then drivers maybe. It could also help that they are not themselves at war with a big oil producing country and they were not recently hit by a hurricane. Where I live in the midwest, gas cost $3.12. Before Katrina hit the gulf, gas was about $2.57 here.","gas-prices","09:31 PM","government-debates","51"

Uncle Sam gave utility companies the monoploies in order to get them to build the infrastructure needed to transmit the power to EVERYWHERY in the US, not just the profittable areas. The same can't be said for the oil industry. Uncle Sam did its best to break up large oil companies like Standard Oil to prevent the creation of monopolies. Sorry, no sale. Uncle Sam has ZERO responsibility for keeping your gas tank full.","gas-prices","09:48 PM","government-debates","54"
"09-01-2005","6309",4,"Matthew S","None","It is illegal to raise the price of electricity in this country. Gasoline is no different. Congress could just make it illegal to raise the price of gasoline. The oil companies would find a way to make it profitable.","daewoo","158798","No joke here. If you can show me how to run a profitable oil business selling goods at a nearly 50% loss, I will give you $10 million dollars tomorrow for that information.

FYI gas prices aren't hurting me personally. I am concerned that there are some people who will have to choose between food for their children and gas to get to work.

"09-02-2005","6309",4,"Symbiote","None","Firstly, I'm not intimately familiar with the electricity industry in the US and its regulations, I'm sure you're not, and if someone here were, they could probably give us a rational explanation on how it works, rather than asserting that they just deal with price ceilings by providing as much electricity as everyone wants anyway.","Matthew S","158833","If an electric company wants to raise its prices then they have to go before the state government and state the reasons. The decision then is up to the state regulators wether or not the company can raise rates.","gas-prices","07:13 AM","government-debates","58"

How far do you think those poor people can drive if there isn't any gas in the gas station, even if the price is low? You have no concept of reality. If you want to live in a nanny gov't, socialist state, move to Europe. We value our freedoms AND capitalism here. The last time the Feds meddled in gasoline, I had to wait in long gas lines hoping that they had gas when I got to the pump. No thanks.","gas-prices","07:56 AM","government-debates","59"
