So, Oil only has one way to go: up.","georged","159787","With Soros and others poised for oil/deficits up, USD down. Administration has only a month of FY2005, so Katrina, gasoline and Afghanistan/Iraq will be prominent issues for 2006 general election fodder and markets.","gas-prices","02:40 PM","government-debates","91"
"09-05-2005","6309",7,"Eddie","None","Ah... Bad example from my part then. But I think you understood my point Yeah, as I said; ""individual profit maximizing in the light of a belief in a vengeful god"". And still the poverty is on the rise in the US... Charity is not something to rely on when trying to build and maintain societies.","JPSartre12","159843","Yes, I got your point, but I wanted to set the record straight as well. There is a large risk in creating a Nanny Government. People begin to believe that charity is a state obligation and NOT an individual's responsibility. As we become more and more socialist in our government, we probably feel less and less personal responsibility to help our brothers.","gas-prices","04:08 PM","government-debates","92"

That's essentially government subsidization (tax-free), government regulated (tax code) and constitutes conditional benevolence. As you point out, not an ideal foundation for building or maintaining a society, much less one claiming freedom of religion.","JPSartre12","159845","That's what happens when you make Uncle Sam's Nannyism the state religion.","gas-prices","04:10 PM","government-debates","93"
