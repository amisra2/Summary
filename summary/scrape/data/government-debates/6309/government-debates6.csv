"09-03-2005","6309",6,"Diogenes99","None","The deregulation was for wholesale prices only, and affects only sales from one electric retailer to another. On the retail level, prices are regulated by the state government. Very true. Bureaucrats are the least efficient critters to bring services to the public, as history has demonstrated every time socialism has been tried. The lotus eaters in the environmental movement have been very successful in guiding us back toward the stone age. There is plenty of demand, and there are plenty of people willing to supply the needs; unfortunately there are also plenty of tree-huggers ready to torpedo any project on environmental grounds rooted in fantasy. Dead wrong. There has never been another society as compassionate or as successful as the US in lifting people out of poverty and misery.","georged","159081","Deregulated wholesale price plus overhead equals retail price, electricity being no different than a retail gasoline station. State regulation is a sham and perpetuation of an expensive, useless bureaucracy. CA proved state regulation means zip. Markets now determine electrical pricing, not bureaucracies. For those who haven't noticed, the US is now part of the global community for better or worse. Investment capital is unavailable for US electrical power generation simply because power can be purchased from Canada for less than new US production costs. There is a factor called ROI in the real world and capital flight is no different between electricity and other US manufacturing entities. Political rants mean little to money as money has no friends or loyalty. Government compassion in the US for poor people? That sounds like a statement from someone who thinks he/she is following the American Dream through irresponsible spending and indebtedness and believes every shred of propaganda issued by all political administrations. There has never been but one area of concern for true financial gain in the US and it has never included anyone from the lower or middle classes for purposes of anything other than maintaining civil stability and providing labor. Those classes did greatly benefit in a flow-through manner during our recent period of great prosperity due to work force requirements, but I suggest you examine conditions prior to ww2 and visit contemporary current inner-cities, depressed rural areas and charity food operations prior to preaching abundance of compassion.","gas-prices","09:10 AM","government-debates","76"
"09-03-2005","6309",6,"Matthew S","None","Gas prices could come down, within days, to where they were 2 years ago if the congress and the president wanted to make it happen. With one act of congress and the presidents signature they could enact an act making it illegal to 1 speculate on the price of oil and 2 by stating that oil will not be sold over 25 or 30 dollars per barrel within the US. If you voted for a republican within the last 30 years you are to blame for high gas prices. Starting in the 80's with the deregultion of industry. If you don't gas prices look in a mirror.","Dzeron","159112","That won't work - it will only result in OPEC selling less gas to us, as has been mentioned. If we want to lower the gas prices, I say we should abolish the gas tax.","gas-prices","01:28 PM","government-debates","77"

My gasoline prices vary from day to day (especially so, lately) but the retail price of electricity only varies with pronouncements from my state Public Service Commission. The investment capital is available, but ill-considered regulations (particularly those speciously based on the Endangered Species Act) and nuisance lawsuits from the environmental groups make it impossible to employ that capital. For example, we haven't built a new refinery in almost 30 years although people are using more gasoline than ever; a group in Arizona has been trying since 1999 to get the necessary permits for another refinery, but they haven't yet been successful. You're changing the subject. I referred to societal compassion, not government compassion (which I agree is nearly nonexistent - see the Canadian health care system for an awful example of where that leads).","gas-prices","02:24 PM","government-debates","78"

It is merely an indication of sticky prices and competion. The price on milk doesn`t change very often. That doesn`t mean that the government sets the price... Investment capital is always available since the US economy is open for foreign as well as domestic investment ventures. I sincerely doubt the US societal compassion.

CA tried that. Tell me the last time utility costs were reduced by a state agency. It's a rubber stamp and nothing else. We travel in different investment circles. I don't know anyone putting their money in US long-term syndication on the equity side not associated with health care real property and a petrochemical plant can be a 40-year useful life situation. What's your take on the US economy in 5, 10 and 20+ years? Good enough to put up the money for what may well be surplus refining capacity before useful life term is reached? Enviros or not, if the return is there money always has its own way of doing things. Corporations are awash in cash. Liquidity has been the name of the game for some time, but there are always bridge buyers.","gas-prices","07:58 PM","government-debates","80"

But many are turned off for the same reasons that US companies are. Too high labor, tax and regulatory costs. Now, that's a joke.

Eliminate US government economic forecasters, brokerage/bank economic forecasters and all other economic forecasters with a product to peddle that requires consumer confidence and I'd be interested in a link. Here's a little blurb from Matthew Simmons (energy advisor for Dick Cheney): "" there is not one serious economist in this world who would say that you can have significant economic growth without the availability of cheap energy."" Simmons rules out the possibility of cheap energy coming decades. When asked if there is a solution to the impending energy crisis he said : ""I don't think there is one. The solution is to pray. Under the best of circumstances, if all prayers are answered there will be no crisis for maybe two years. After that it's a certainty."" Here's a little fact for those who feel oil prices will come down: At present rates of consumption the US will be importing 90% of oil requirements by 2020. We're using the easy to get (cheap) stuff now. But the oil that remains is going to be increasingly expensive to produce and it will tend to be of a lesser quality, necessitating higher refining costs, than what has already been used. All of those costs will have to be passed on in the form of price hikes or -- in some cases -- spikes.
