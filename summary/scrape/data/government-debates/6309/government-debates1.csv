The inability of Americans to work together as a whole is dumbfounding. Our collective ""bi-polar"" disorder has set our nation poles apart on our views and opinions that is unprecidented. Dream, if you will, of Americans pulling together for a common cause. When you are finished having yourself a hardy laugh at this next to impossible idea, consider this. High gas prices are OUR fault. They are not the republicans or the democrats or Bush's fault. It is OUR fault. The gas prices are skyhigh because they KNOW we will pay it. We may gripe about it, but nobody I know intends on cutting back or protesting. Protesting, you ask? How? We have to get to work. That takes cars. That takes gasoline. This mentality has us all by the balls. But there IS a way. And it's so simple, you are going to be disappointed you didn't figure this out for yourself. I know I am. Obviously, we need gasoline regardless of the cost. So, how do we protest? How can we possibly boycott? Are you ready for the simple solution? If EVERYONE would refuse to buy gasoline from the top two oil companies, perhaps Mobile and Exxon, and buy our gas elsewhere, eventually the top two oil companies will be FORCED to cut their prices. Then comes the following competition. Gas prices will inevitably drop. Meanwhile, our gas tanks remained full and we made it to our jobs just the same. It wouldn't take 60 days for us to correct this problem ourselves. But the idea of getting America rowing the same boat in the same direction is next to a fantasy.","gas-prices","01:52 PM","government-debates","3"

Your suggestion besides being socialistic in nature would only serve to reduce supply without reducing demand. Government involvement in setting a ""fair profit"" is antithetical to our market system except in rare instances. The fact that our individual consumption has gone up lately along with increased international(China) competition for existing production of crude has brought us here. Sooner or later oil will stay high and then what? Maybe we should consider driving cars that don't weigh what elephants weigh. Maybe we should design hybrid tanks.","gas-prices","02:37 PM","government-debates","4"

"08-31-2005","6309",1,"None","None","None","Diogenes99","158328","The problem is less with the supply of crude oil, and more with how we process it. Taking the lead additive out of gasoline some 30+ years ago meant that we now get less gasoline from a barrel of oil than we used to, and there are more low-sulfur regs coming soon that will reduce the gasoline per barrel of crude by another 3% to 5%. We haven't built a new refinery for almost 30 years and the ones we do have, have been operating at 98.5% of capacity. That means that even one unit in one refinery going down for maintenance reduces the supply of gasoline. And that's before Katrina wiped out a bunch of refineries on the Gulf Coast. There's a group in Arizona that has been trying since 1999 to get the permits to build another refinery, but they aren't there yet. Borrowing crude from the Strategic Reserve won't help as long as there is no way to refine it. Another problem is that the refineries have to produce a boutique of gasoline formulations for different areas of the country at different times of the year - and the courts have ruled that EPA doesn't have to consider costs when they emit their regulations. Bottom line: EPA is enforcing conservation by forcing the people to make hard choices about whether they really need to drive somewhere by raising the prices. Environmental activists should be overjoyed.","gas-prices","03:21 PM","government-debates","8"

I'm afraid it's you, Matthew, that doesn't realize how the system works. The key words are ""open market"", and it's a GLOBAL market, the NYSE plays a big part, but the world can and will go on without it. ""Oil company profits"" are controlled by the price of oil, oil companies have no control on the price of oil , so laying the current high prices at the feet of the oil companies and villainizing them for making profits is ridiculous and shows a lack of understanding of how the economy actually works. The USA is not capable of standing alone as far as oil reserves are concerned. Simply put, the USA is NOT capable of producing enough oil to meet its consumption, nor will it likely ever be. The simple fact is, there's not a darn thing Bush, Congress, or any gov't agency can do control the price of oil, even if they did decide to enact some type of communist law regarding the control of the free market. Sure the Iraq war isn't helping, but you're looking to place the blame on the wrong people. You have identified who the real culprits are, you just haven't realized. At any rate, this topic is incredibly comlex and far reaching, if only it were so simple. Waxy","gas-prices","05:03 PM","government-debates","12"

The way the oil gathering and refining system works in the USA, it would have only a minor impact on the two companies in question, if at all. The only people this would serve to hurt is the poor gas station owners and attendents at the companies chosen to be boycotted, through no fault of their own.
