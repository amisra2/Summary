"09-02-2005","6309",5,"JPSartre12","None","More liberal claptrap. Name me two people that you PERSONALLY know that fall into that category. How far do you think those poor people can drive if there isn't any gas in the gas station, even if the price is low? You have no concept of reality. If you want to live in a nanny gov't, socialist state, move to Europe. We value our freedoms AND capitalism here. The last time the Feds meddled in gasoline, I had to wait in long gas lines hoping that they had gas when I got to the pump. No thanks.","Matthew S","158842","I will not name them. I could but I am not going to. Just say that several of my employees are having problems and they are paid well over min. wage. FYI I am in middle management. I have no controll over wages or company policy before you start in on me. AHHH good old capitalism, I suppose you will be wanting poor, and work houses, and debtors prisons. Ever read Dickens now that was captialism at its finist. So your answer is that the free market is the answer even if the price goes up to 10$ a gallon and that those on the lower rungs of society our just screwed then. Talk about selfish behavior.","gas-prices","08:19 AM","government-debates","61"
"09-02-2005","6309",5,"billsco","None","Matthew, you're being given an golden opportunity to learn some intracacies about the oil industry and commodity trading. I see that opportunity slipping away quickly by you insisting on demonizing the Republicans instead.","Matthew S","158844","Oh I am learning. I am understanding that in this system you either make it or you die. There is no compassion or concern for the less fortunate. I fully understand how the oil industry and commodity trading works. I took economics and understand about suppy and demand.","gas-prices","08:27 AM","government-debates","62"
"09-02-2005","6309",5,"Matthew S","None","If an electric company wants to raise its prices then they have to go before the state government and state the reasons. The decision then is up to the state regulators wether or not the company can raise rates.","georged","158853","Wrong. Electricity was deregulated in 1992 because, as is the case with oil, the US can not supply all of its own needs and must import electricity. The US currently imports 35% of electricity requirements with Canada being one of the largest suppliers. Some states, California was probably the most publicized example, then attempted to use state agencies to regulate and buy electricity futures to service public requirements. Putting inept and inefficient bureaucrats into a public trading scenario was like feeding Christians to the lions. CA experienced a hot summer creating high electrical demand, brownouts resulted, bureaucrats went to market and CA's electric rates immediately quadrupled. Lawsuits are still in motion. Sooner or later Americans will begin to understand what capital flight means; why there's no investment being made to increase gasoline refinement or electric production, a complete lack of demand for other industrial expansion capital and crumbling infrastructure. Then they'll be forced to take a close look at the quality of leadership tending our fiscal well-being during our now rapid migration from industrial superpower to service economy. Regardless of US political claims, there has never been any compassion for the poor or less fortunate. In a democracy driven by capitalism, they're an overhead addressed only by the need and requirement to retain civil order, nothing else. Any illusions about financial equality being a national goal are naive.","gas-prices","09:18 AM","government-debates","64"
"09-02-2005","6309",5,"Steeeeve","None","A $10 a gallon maybe we can stop messing around and actually get another form of fuel. Blaiming the republicans is a dumb idea. What are they going to do? The reason gas prices went up so rapidly was because of an increase in demand. Simple economics really. Our gas station here went from selling something like $2,000 a day to $30,000 a day worth of gas. http://www.collegiatetimes.com/news/...005-09-02.html","georged","158860","If you don't think our ME war financed through public debt and subsequent USD devaluation don't contribute to oil prices, you're fooling yourself. That 'fear factor' (expansion of ME war and resultant reduced supply) is $10-20/bbl USD without natural disasters depending whose numbers you like. This administration's policies have done more fiscal harm to this country than any administration I can recall, though the Regan Administration runs a close second. And I was stupid enough to vote for Bush the first time around because I thought he'd follow traditional Republican ideology. As time progresses, my ego finds it increasingly difficult to admit my error in judgment could be so enormous.","gas-prices","09:46 AM","government-debates","65"

Electric companies are still allowed to show a profit. 10-11% is pretty standard. So, assuming we apply your plan here, we could expect oil industry pricing to go UP at least 1.5%. Way to go. Respectfully, please stop this line of argument, someboyd might actually listen, and gas prices are high enough without raising them another 1.5%. This is simplyw what happens in a nation when you stop capital improvements on its infrastructure. As george pointed out, the return ona refinery is a 20 yr return. It is impossible using americas numbers to justify such an investment.","gas-prices","10:03 AM","government-debates","66"

"09-02-2005","6309",5,"PoohBear","None","not saying this because i believe but one of my old science / phhysics teacher believe the world would come to an end ( jesus coming back) in 2007 because 7 is god's number.. any comments?","Ooaman","158880","One question, what does this have to do with gas? I don't know, but I wanted to give my take on it. Jesus was not born in 0 a.d. For one thing, the Christian Era is meseared on the Roman Calender. They never had any roman numeral of 0. Why they had I for 1, V for 5, X for 10, C for 100 but did not have the letter O for 0 is beyond me. Because lack of proper records from the first century ad/last century bc were not kept well. The Romans had no idea at all of any Messiah so they wouldn't have cared about the census that Joesph and Mary had to sign to pay taxes in Bethlehem. Long story short, Jesus was born sometime between 6 b.c. and 4 b.c. (and possibly in September). If the calender was acurate, that would put us at 2011 - 2009 which means that 2007 would have already passed.","gas-prices","11:15 AM","government-debates","68"

There's always a solution to temporary transportation problems and it usually doesn't come from Uncle Sam. Scrooge was right ""Let them die and decrease the surplus population"". I'd rather have gas to pump at $10/gallon than a storage tank full of air. For a middle manager, you don't know didly about business and what drives it. For example, if you can afford gas, why don't you offer to drive your employees for a small fee? THAT'S capitalism. It's a win-win scenario.","gas-prices","12:26 PM","government-debates","69"

If your local gas station has to pay $3.00/gallon because he has gas shipped from 1000 miles away during a shortage, who would sell it for $1.50? There's no such thing as losing money on every gallon and making up for it with volume.","gas-prices","12:31 PM","government-debates","70"

Companies aren't investing in US infrastructure because of the high costs to do business in the US. Federal, State and local gov'ts suck the lifeblood out of industry through taxation and regulation and what's left is assaulted by organized labor. It's a wonder that anything is ""Made in the USA"" anymore. That's YOUR opinion. Mine's not quite that cynical.","gas-prices","12:41 PM","government-debates","71"

The US public is continually encouraged to live above a level of sound personal fiscal responsibility using debt with government as an example.

During regulation, a utility submitted annual operating and capital requests with a 8% profit (non-taxable) for bond debt service to the regulatory body and it was rubber stamped. Utility bonds were formerly known as the 'widow's investment' because they returned consistent, acceptable interest rates. Imported power requirements forced deregulation and CA utilities did briefly sell power to other grids but CA quickly put a stop to that. It still remains a problem for most Americans to understand that we're in a global economy with new rules as a debtor nation.","gas-prices","01:17 PM","government-debates","73"

On the retail level, prices are regulated by the state government. Very true. Bureaucrats are the least efficient critters to bring services to the public, as history has demonstrated every time socialism has been tried. The lotus eaters in the environmental movement have been very successful in guiding us back toward the stone age. There is plenty of demand, and there are plenty of people willing to supply the needs; unfortunately there are also plenty of tree-huggers ready to torpedo any project on environmental grounds rooted in fantasy. Dead wrong. There has never been another society as compassionate or as successful as the US in lifting people out of poverty and misery.","gas-prices","11:57 PM","government-debates","74"
