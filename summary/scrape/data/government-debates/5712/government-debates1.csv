When a nation becomes a superpower and starts trying to control the world, naturally some people won't like it. And because it's a superpower, the people who don't like the superpower become hopeless desperados. We all know what they do then. When terrorists attack a nation, it creates an atmosphere of fear that can easily be exploited by totalitarians. The Patriot Act comes to mind. People become obsessed with security over liberty and fighting the terrorists instead of preserving economic freedom. However, the whole reason the terrorists even attack in the first place is because of the powerful interventionist government. I don't know if the government is doing this consciously or not, but I do know that our government's interventionism provoked terrorism, which is an excuse for totalitarianism. Perhaps we are too far down the road to destruction to turn back.","interventionism-terrorism-totalitarianism","10:19 PM","government-debates","1"

To oversimplify a lot: the Palestinians (supported by their brother Arabs generally) hate Israel because they believe themselves to have been deprived of their ancient lands and freedoms by Zionist conquest. They see themselves as victims of Jewish oppression. American interest in this dispute, again to oversimplify, has been driven by the fact that Arab lands happen to conceal vast reservoirs of oil and there is an obvious energy dependency factor at work here. Also, there's no denying that a powerful American-Jewish political lobby exists, which has influenced US policy in the Middle East. Some of the other parts of the world you mention have spawned terrorists. or, if you prefer, ""freedom fighters"". (A popular euphemism for the suicide bombers in Iraq is ""insurgents""). But the visceral anti-Americanism of bin Laden seems to be a ""phase difference"" in the motivation of terrorism. In other words, there is something specific and profoundly desperate in the hatred of America evinced by Osama bin Laden and his allies. It might be mentioned that anti-American sentiment is currently fashionable in some European countries - particularly France. American interventionism might provoke terrorism. But, on the other hand, terrorism might provoke intervention. A lot depends on your ""world view"" or ideological assumptions.","interventionism-terrorism-totalitarianism","02:19 AM","government-debates","5"
