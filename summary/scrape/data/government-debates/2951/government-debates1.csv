I'll post my thoughts later.","flag-burning","08:41 PM","government-debates","1"
"08-17-2004","2951",1,"None","None","None","Duo_Maxwell","62575","like more legislation and more government has fixed all things in the past Technically it is a freedom of expression. Frankly, I'd rather have my nation go out in a bang then get trampled on.","flag-burning","12:24 AM","government-debates","2"
"08-18-2004","2951",1,"None","None","None","emclean","62992","i think burning the flag in protest is one of the most disrespectifuy things you can do, but it is protected as freedom of expersion, is i will defend th eright to do it. (but if you are doing in my town i will call the cops, there are laws about any open burning here)","flag-burning","07:36 PM","government-debates","3"

You'd figure with nuclear poliferation, porous homeland defenses, the comming storm of the baby boomers, so on and so forth, petty issues like these would be ignored....but then again....","flag-burning","02:12 AM","government-debates","5"
"08-19-2004","2951",1,"None","None","None","Oscar26","63238","Doesn't it seem that the issue of flag burning is rather a red herring. When was the last time someone burnt a flag in protest? I know I haven't seen anything about a burning flag in any of the protest coverage, and surely, given the state of the nation, there would be news of it were it happening. But by offering the debate about this constitutional amendment we are diverted from issues such as the state of the economy, the disenfranchisement of the middle class, the loss of jobs for those who aren't interested in the new global information economy - or who can't compete there - etc.","flag-burning","11:53 PM","government-debates","6"

"08-20-2004","2951",1,"None","None","None","Master_Shake","63324","Oscar and George, you are both absolutely right. Both of those amendment coming before the congress are purely there as wedge issues. Everyone in politics knows they will never make it, they are just using them as an attempt to make the people who vote against them look bad. These issues are a waste of our time, and like you two said, they are being used as a distraction from the mess the Bush administration has made,","flag-burning","04:29 PM","government-debates","8"

You are of course all correct, though I agree with emcean that it is a disrespectful (and I think pretty pathetic), thing to do.","flag-burning","01:17 PM","government-debates","9"

I assume this means you support invasion of all non-english speaking, non-Christian nations who dislike us and our flag.","flag-burning","11:05 AM","government-debates","12"

As for the invasion of non-english speaking countries, I never said I supported that. When I stand up in the mornings at school for the pledge of allegience/national anthem (or anywhere for that matter), I am honoring those who have sacrificed their lives so that we could be where we are today. In my honest opinion, that is desrespectful. If it werent for the men and women in the service, we could all be speaking german or some other language (or at least those of us with blonde hair and blue eyes). Yes, it is freedom of expression, and yes that is what those men and women that are being honored have fought for. But burning our flag is just something that I can't STAND to see, and will what I am able to to stop it.","flag-burning","02:34 PM","government-debates","13"

I intensely dislike people who scream at their children in public, but that doesn't mean I'm going to change their mental attitudes by correcting them. And there are some really dumb drivers on the road, but pulling them over and and giving them a good thrashing isn't going to correct their deficiencies. Why would you physically beat someone burning an inanimate object such as a flag? Those who died in military service for our country are, dead. They certainly didn't die for a flag, they died under orders to defend their country. I see no disrespect for them in flag burning, that's merely an individual or group of individuals protesting what they feel is disrespect by our leadership to our country and those who died to protect it. I'm not a flag burner or protestor, but I do believe in free speech and live and let live. My hatred is reserved for those who would attempt to do undeserved harm to me or my loved ones.","flag-burning","03:57 PM","government-debates","14"

But some (I say some cause of the draft along time ago) fought for what the flag stands for. Guess I should of made my words clearer. Lets say, that someone very close to you died. That person had some people who severely disliked some of his/her beliefs. Now what if those people got some his/her belongings that meant alot to him or her and started buring them out in the street out of protest of what his beliefs were. Would that not get you pretty mad? Would you not go out and try and stop it? Does that not show disrespect for the person who died that was close to you? Agian a good point. Now on a different subject kinda, well very, off topic. Your name looks familiar, are you on FTE?","flag-burning","04:13 PM","government-debates","15"
