I don't know about you all, but whenever I see someone burning a flag, I want to knock the snot out of someone. I could go into moral arguments, but I fell that this is justifiable enough.","flag-burning","05:40 PM","government-debates","31"

By your logic, I can get a book banned by saying it made me want to smash someone's face in. What about those insane people who have ""trigger words"" that make them go nuts? There are people who get enraged at the sound of words like ""Wisconsin."" What should we do? Ban all talk of Wisconsin? No. The violence itself should be illegal, but not the speech.","flag-burning","09:49 PM","government-debates","32"

The point of free speech is not ""you have the freedom of speech whenever it agrees with the majority of people"". The Bill of Rights is mainly for minority rights. The whole point of the first ammendment is that no matter how offended anyone gets or no matter how much you want to punch my face in, I have the right to voice my opinion with spoken words, or in symbolic speech. Dzeron, people already do ban books for less reason than they wanted to punch someone's face in. Harry Potter is banned in many places in the south because witches are bad (no idea why).","flag-burning","12:14 AM","government-debates","33"

If someone burned the union jack, I wouldn't give a damn, nor would I if they burned the red flag of socialism. It seems a rather trivial thing to get worked up about, and certainly to sacrifice fundamental freedoms to prevent.","flag-burning","04:23 PM","government-debates","35"

Those who burn it generally do so as a symbolic way to voice their disapproval of something the country is doing.
