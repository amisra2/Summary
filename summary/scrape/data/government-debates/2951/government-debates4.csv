The fact that they do it indicates that KNOW they are free, and they trust and embrace that freedom.","VTCruiser","107322","oh so you degrade the american flag to a piece of fabric i see. What do you think that piece of fabric represents anyways?? why would someone want to think they are free enough to burn the symbol of their own freedom to do that??? It makes no sense to me","flag-burning","02:28 PM","government-debates","46"

If you think that is degrading - oh well - I don't value a flag (a symbol) over freedom of speech (a huge part of what it's supposed to represent).","flag-burning","02:38 PM","government-debates","47"

Freedom is one of the positives, but freedom can be found, often to a greater degree, in much of Europe. The burning of the stars and stripes could be a symbol of what successive US administrations have done to burn the reality of freedom and justice.","flag-burning","03:20 PM","government-debates","48"

"04-14-2005","2951",4,"VTCruiser","None","i see your point, but that doesnt mean the flag itself still doesnt mean freedom.","zachvac","107548","Fine, let it stand for freedom. People are allowed to argue for less freedoms (you I would bet would argue against the freedom to get an abortion) so why shouldn't they be able to symbolically express that. Who are we to force people to love freedom? Sounds pretty arrogant if you ask me. If we have to force people to love this country with things such as the pledge and banning flag-burning, we need to re-evaluate what the country stands for.","flag-burning","08:14 PM","government-debates","54"
