"10-14-2004","2951",2,"wezol5484","None","For one, Im not a christian, so no. As for the invasion of non-english speaking countries, I never said I supported that. When I stand up in the mornings at school for the pledge of allegience/national anthem (or anywhere for that matter), I am honoring those who have sacrificed their lives so that we could be where we are today. In my honest opinion, that is desrespectful. If it werent for the men and women in the service, we could all be speaking german or some other language (or at least those of us with blonde hair and blue eyes). Yes, it is freedom of expression, and yes that is what those men and women that are being honored have fought for. But burning our flag is just something that I can't STAND to see, and will what I am able to to stop it.","Waxy","71633","There's a saying I'm fond of Wezol, it goes something along the lines of - The men and women that fought for this country didn't die for the flag, they died to protect your right to burn it.

For me to react in a physical manner to a living person showing disrespect to someone's memory would put me at their level and, as stated in my first sentence, I don't react to those emotions.","flag-burning","04:39 PM","government-debates","17"

Waxy","zachvac","73634","I've also heard that quote and used it many times saying I didn't know who said it. Do you? And the reason flag burning is an issue is that after that they will take our right away to sit for the pledge or anthem, and then it will be the right to protest in public, and then the right to say anything bad about the government. Any law that goes against the first amendment is an invitation for other laws to be passed using that law as support (such as arguments for keeping under god ""we have in God we trust on $""). I also think that not only should under God be removed but the in God we trust be removed also, but that isn't going to happen for a while.","flag-burning","05:13 PM","government-debates","18"
"11-09-2004","2951",2,"None","None","None","zonkola","76448","The American flag is a symbol. The important bit about a symbol is not its physical manifestation, but rather what it represents. While I find flag burning distasteful, I'm much more concerned about the people who would compromise what the flag stands for. In other words, it's an obvious wedge issue. Should play well in the red states.","flag-burning","01:36 AM","government-debates","19"

"11-09-2004","2951",2,"None","None","None","zachvac","76613","Many people say that flag burning is disrespectful. Well that's the whole reason people are so bent on having that right. They are making sure that no matter how offensive or disrespectful the action they are doing is to this country, as long as they aren't breaking any other laws (burning other peoples' belongings as posted earlier) they cannot be arrested for the sole reason that it's disrespectful to our country. And many people say there are more important things to think about, 2 comments on that. 1. Are you saying you can't think about more than one thing related to politics? 2. Just because there aren't any flag-burnings, it's the principle that counts. If they can ban flag-burning because they don't like disrespect towards the government they will be able to Force people to stand for the pledge and anthem, they will be able to start cencoring outrageous statements against the US, then not so outrageous. The whole purpose of the Bill of Rights is that there is no line to draw, these are our unalienable rights. And as soon as they declare them not unalienable anymore, the government will have a lot more power. The bill of rights grants rights that can't be taken away, and you say taking one of them away is just to divert attention?","flag-burning","04:44 PM","government-debates","23"

And when I, or the others, who said that this was to divert attention, or that it is a wedge issue, we meant that no matter what some of it's supporters might eventually like to do, they all knew it would never pass, but they brought it up anyway as a wedge issue. That's what we, or at least I, meant. And it didn't pass. As I understand it, it was voted down.","flag-burning","01:10 PM","government-debates","24"

I believe the only time a flag should be burned, whether a national, state or foreign flag, is when the flag is being retired due to poor condition.","flag-burning","04:11 PM","government-debates","25"

"11-20-2004","2951",2,"None","None","None","Dzeron","78253","I'm afraid that if we outlaw flag burning, it will spark an anarchist revolution. Anarchists are, after all, the main group that burns flags as far as I know. They also have the highest tendency to resist the police, since they're anarchists, and they will definitely do this if the police interferes with their demonstrations. As for the disrespect thing, we can't outlaw disrespecting the country. That principle can easily be hijacked by fascist Republicans who will ban certain books, TV shows, etc. that are ""disrespectful"" to the country, and we can all say goodbye to freedom of speech.","flag-burning","10:20 PM","government-debates","27"
