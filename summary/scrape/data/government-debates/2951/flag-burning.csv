I know I haven't seen anything about a burning flag in any of the protest coverage, and surely, given the state of the nation, there would be news of it were it happening.

Why would you physically beat someone burning an inanimate object such as a flag? Those who died in military service for our country are, dead. They certainly didn't die for a flag, they died under orders to defend their country. I see no disrespect for them in flag burning, that's merely an individual or group of individuals protesting what they feel is disrespect by our leadership to our country and those who died to protect it. I'm not a flag burner or protestor, but I do believe in free speech and live and let live.

That person had some people who severely disliked some of his/her beliefs. Now what if those people got some his/her belongings that meant alot to him or her and started buring them out in the street out of protest of what his beliefs were. Would that not get you pretty mad? Would you not go out and try and stop it? Does that not show disrespect for the person who died that was close to you? Agian a good point.

And the reason flag burning is an issue is that after that they will take our right away to sit for the pledge or anthem, and then it will be the right to protest in public, and then the right to say anything bad about the government. Any law that goes against the first amendment is an invitation for other laws to be passed using that law as support (such as arguments for keeping under god ""we have in God we trust on $""). I also think that not only should under God be removed but the in God we trust be removed also, but that isn't going to happen for a while.","flag-burning","05:13 PM","government-debates","18"

Freedom is one of the positives, but freedom can be found, often to a greater degree, in much of Europe. The burning of the stars and stripes could be a symbol of what successive US administrations have done to burn the reality of freedom and justice.","VTCruiser","107493","i see your point, but that doesnt mean the flag itself still doesnt mean freedom.","flag-burning","05:38 PM","government-debates","49"
