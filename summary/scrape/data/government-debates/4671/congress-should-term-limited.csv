Which is precisely the objective of my fledgling website, tenurecorrupts.com. One of the pages on the site is devoted to the various kinds of amendments which might be employed by our activists, and to devise the most effective wording of a proposed amendment. The particular wording I am putting forth (besides specifying 3 terms for the House and 2 terms for the Senate) contains the phrase exempts current incumbents as long as they are successfully reelected. The obvious objective here is to make the amendment totally unobjectionable to all the incumbents who have to vote on the proposed amendment. I conceived this weasel wording back in the days when successful incumbent reelections were running in the low 90 percentiles, and I figured that if it took a few years after ratification for term limits to effectively take place, it was a worthwhile tradeoff. Imagine my horror when I discovered that the 2004 reelection rate was 99%! At that rate, replacing only 1%, or 5 or 6 incumbents every 2 years, it would take about 50 elections, or 100 years, to get only one-half of Congress term limited! Of course, the skeptic will say that 2004 was an anomaly. Future reelection rates are not likely to be so highly successful! Yeah, sure. In the face of electoral historical trends, I would be willing to bet that 99% is gonna be far more frequent than 90%. I think the lazy, indifferent voter who votes mostly on name recognition is here to stay for a long time, sustaining the status quo and the entrenched incumbencies. Remember, when elections are even reasonably close, it is the fraction of stand-pat name recognition voters who keep the incumbents in place. And they will always be with us. It is gonna take term limits to change this situation. So lets get crackin! I'm Nelson Lee Walker, and I believe our Congress needs Term Limits. www.tenurecorrupts.com","congress-should-term-limited","05:05 PM","government-debates","1"

Nothing ventured, nothing gained. I don't have any illusions that the job will be easy or successful, but I believe there is a major 'silent majority' waiting to get on a bandwagon if one could get going. The least I can do is try.

"03-29-2005","4671",1,"None","None","None","Dono","102584","We have a term limitation tool already in place, though it is used by a limited portion of the eligible and often in strange ways. It is called the vote. Many will vote in the next election for their party's candidate regardless of positions, issues or past performance, the sheep vote that politicians depend on. It has been said for many years that the best way to get in office is to be in office and that is a truism. Sadly, most Americans know more about their football team than they do their government.

While I have yet to see any public value from going to the moon or ME elections on my tax dollars, I applaud your eagerness in attempting to make changes in a system that, in my mind, has become so corrupt even the lazy and apathetic public is climbing on the gravy train to feed on public money.","congress-should-term-limited","04:51 PM","government-debates","5"

None of you mentioned whether or not you ever clicked on my website http://www.tenurecorrupts.com Since I am deeply involved with trying to get more exposure of the site to the general public, I am trying to understand why no one (even those like you who answer on the forum) ever seem to click on the site, and even when they agree to the idea, don't bother to sign on. I would very much appreciate your insight and advice on how to imrove my site responses. thanks, nels96","congress-should-term-limited","12:46 PM","government-debates","7"

If you visit my site (below)you will see some of the arguments which should be considered. Because there is so little turnover in Congress, you have no idea how many ""Lincolnesque"" type individuals don't even consider running for office. And if they do, and win, they never get to do anything because they don't have seniority. And who says the 'neophytes' don't have more brains and talent than the tenured pols who have never had to earn a paycheck in the real world? Real world citizens have real experience, professional politicians only have cunning as to how to game the system! nels96 www.tenurecorrupts.com","congress-should-term-limited","05:36 PM","government-debates","13"
