I do like how you get all your news from various gay websites that will distort the actual news at all costs. Notice the title here....""Va. bill would halt lesbian insemination""....It doesn't mention that it is also against unmarried women as well. In fact the whole article makes it out to be an attack on lesbians...It seems to me that it is an attack on any women not married. While certainly a dumb bill, I do like his stance on abortion.","virginia","07:31 AM","government-debates","5"

Only a crazy, busybody, control freak cares. I have news for you it is most likely a lesbian who will go to a doctor for artificial insemination. However this crazy idiot will not be able to stop do it at home artificial insemination.","virginia","06:28 PM","government-debates","6"

However, don't go saying all Virginia is against gays and lesbians...your stereotypes are just as bad as the people that are anti-gay.","virginia","07:48 PM","government-debates","7"

Maryland has a Republican governor, but it was like 70% Kerry in the last election. I just think when you have a state such heavily slanted to one side, the governor takes re-election for granted and think they can do whatever they want.","virginia","11:35 PM","government-debates","10"
