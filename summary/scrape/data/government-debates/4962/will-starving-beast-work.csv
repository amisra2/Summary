I guess that's what the CATO guy says. But is it supposed to? Is this what certain republicans are shooting for? And if goverment can suck up money whenever it needs then why do we have such huge deficits? According to the one page, it's because of the tax cuts. So with politicians in power who are trying to starve the beast, cutting taxes where it will decrease revenue the most, I don't see how the goverment can suck up money whenever it needs it.","will-starving-beast-work","04:45 PM","government-debates","3"
"04-27-2005","4962",1,"None","None","None","Eddie","113176","This is not really a question of economics, but a question of politics. Will the huge decifits create a political situation where politicians feel compelled to cut spending in order to project an image of fiscal conservatism? But why wouldn`t it merely create a political situation where politicians can reap the same benefits by simply raising taxes (ecp. if lowered taxes are percieved to be the culrit of the decifits in the first place)? To me, it seems like a weird tactic...","will-starving-beast-work","05:58 PM","government-debates","4"

It is called the shadow economy. Basically the people create their own currency, use it in place of the dollar, and the government loses its tax base and must either shrink or collapse.","will-starving-beast-work","05:58 PM","government-debates","5"

Taxes are not really based on actual moneys, but rather the market value of goods and services. In most normal cases, this means that a portion of the money-transaction is taxed. However, if you where to barter goods and services instead of using money, you would still be liable to pay the tax on the market value of the good or service. At least that`s how it works in Sweden and EU.","will-starving-beast-work","06:06 PM","government-debates","6"

While fear is as effective a motivator/governing tool as prosperity, the masses still require something in their bellies and false hope or they get unruly. And the have-nots and delusional lower middle class of any country is a very large group of people with marginal at best stability. In the US in particular the government has spent the last 30-years shaping that mass into an entity that believes their government is taking care of them. To suddenly abandon that public policy would require a state police organization so dominant it would be difficult to contain the discontented.","will-starving-beast-work","09:10 AM","government-debates","9"

""I'll just get massively in debt so I won't spend money on things"". Poppycock. The ""Starve the Beast"" concept is a cowardly replacement for a lack of fiscal discipline. Surplus? Great.

Both countries have a major personal debt problem fuelled by irresponsible lending and a lack of financial education. When the whole world seems to be telling you ""buy now pay later"" it doesn't seem so bad when the government does it too. It only doesn't seem as bad in the UK because the government contracted out government borrowing for capital expenditure so that is could be hidden off balance sheet.","will-starving-beast-work","11:37 AM","government-debates","13"

But I'm at an age where my financial future holds few mysteries. While the subject has been discussed in other threads, IMO a lack of personal responsibility is the major problem with government spending. Public attitude is fixated on spending itself into financial oblivion to maintain a personal life style our economy is no longer capable of sustaining. So they applaud the Iraq folly, Medicare prescription funding so immense real numbers are not yet available, military spending levels based on aggressive capability the rest of the world abandoned decades ago, tax breaks for energy companies with no provision for alternative fuels and any other scheme that garners votes and floats our leaky financial boat. But, it's the middle-aged and young who will eventually shoulder the burden of fiscal irresponsibility, not me. If they're that stupid, so be it. Jo, you haven't priced a set of Churchhill doubles.","will-starving-beast-work","12:32 PM","government-debates","17"
