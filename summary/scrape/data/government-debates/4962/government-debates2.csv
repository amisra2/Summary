"04-28-2005","4962",2,"Alan Ryan","None","Reductions in revenues might be the best way to control government spending if budget deficits were an effective barrier against greater government expenditures: they are not. As you say, government borrowing makes up the difference and everybody's happy - aren't they ?","georged","113521","I'm fine with current circumstances. But I'm at an age where my financial future holds few mysteries. While the subject has been discussed in other threads, IMO a lack of personal responsibility is the major problem with government spending. Public attitude is fixated on spending itself into financial oblivion to maintain a personal life style our economy is no longer capable of sustaining. So they applaud the Iraq folly, Medicare prescription funding so immense real numbers are not yet available, military spending levels based on aggressive capability the rest of the world abandoned decades ago, tax breaks for energy companies with no provision for alternative fuels and any other scheme that garners votes and floats our leaky financial boat. But, it's the middle-aged and young who will eventually shoulder the burden of fiscal irresponsibility, not me. If they're that stupid, so be it. Jo, you haven't priced a set of Churchhill doubles.","will-starving-beast-work","12:32 PM","government-debates","17"

It's just a case of spend, spend, spend, and let the tab fall where it may - we won't be picking it up.","will-starving-beast-work","12:47 PM","government-debates","18"

The way to starve goverment in to put politicans who are anti-pork, have good economics backgrounds and adamantly pro-state's rights. Obviously no one in the US federal Congress even remotely comes close.","will-starving-beast-work","04:04 PM","government-debates","22"
