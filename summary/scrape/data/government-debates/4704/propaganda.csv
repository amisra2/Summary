Amendment 1 can be counted as slander as many times as the government uses it to get people on their side.","propaganda","07:14 AM","government-debates","1"

In the modern (western) world of mass democracy, mass entertainment, etc., propaganda is probably an indispensible tool in the hands of those who would impose social control. Many people have no opinions of their own, and these have to be pumped into them from outside like lubricants into machinery.","propaganda","10:36 AM","government-debates","3"

During the Cold War they used it to try to convince people Communism was bad. Telling you that killing is bad is propoganda. Actually you telling me that propoganda is bad is propoganda.","propaganda","09:35 PM","government-debates","5"
