We are seeing the results of all of his fears now as we sit on the brink of the total collapse of America's socioeconomic system. And what is so telling about his warning was that he foresaw the spirit of tolerance and political correctness which has so dumbed down the so called intellectuals who believe only they are sophisticated enough to embrace these socialistic beliefs. And it is they who will be eliminated first once they actually accomplish the goals of the collective. As I have said in so many debates here to these pseudo intellectuals who wallow in their self important superiority; it is they who look down on we who embrace the traditions and faith in God of our Fathers, who are the true sheep being led to a slaughter which is founded upon and sustained by the lies of total and perfect equality which are doled out by elitists who have no intention at all of sharing the wealth with these followers who prove how useless they are since they were so easily manipulated. He even mentioned the moral dumbing down of society and the acceptance of homosexuality as a tool to destroy this society just as I have argued, as he so matter of factly said that the conquering powers that be wont allow them to survive for 2 seconds once they win power. How sad it is that it takes an ex-KGB guy to voice, and agree with what I, a bible believing American has seen coming all along. Anyway, great video and very informative. Thanks for posting it. Sadly though, it will probably be wasted on those who are the very victims its warning is meant for.","conservatives-you-want-know-what-happened-us-view","08:41 PM","government-debates","2"

I first read it more than 35 years ago. It would be great if these wannabe proletariat socialists would read it and get a taste of what they are buying into without even putting up a fight to retain their freedoms. What is also evidence of their philosophical cowardice is the fact that this thread has existed for more than 6 hours now and not one avowed leftist has even commented on that video. They know all too well that they are the morally depraved sheep who that KGB agent was warning us about who have swallowed the leftist propaganda hook, line and sinker. First through the school systems, then through the media, and finally through our POP CULTURE which is today rampant with it. And the sheep on the left loudly follow as they shout down anyone who tries to warn them of the approaching abyss which they are blindly marching in lock step towards.","conservatives-you-want-know-what-happened-us-view","11:23 PM","government-debates","4"

Maybe what we progressives ought to do is preach to the youth of America the virtues of the radical right. At that point the youth of America, given their contrary nature, will drive the right wing from the seats of power.","conservatives-you-want-know-what-happened-us-view","07:23 PM","government-debates","5"

Actually the left already does in the schools and collages you would think that they would have completely taken over by now. Ho thats right once these heads full of mush get in to the real world they realize that what the liberals have taught them over the past 20 or so years is wrong and they become republicans. Actually if Obama gets to the white house and implements his agenda you will see double digit unemployment and interest rates around 21% like in the Carter years which was the last time socialism was really with no way for the republicans to oppose it. That coupled with the deep depression that will follow. I think He and a democrat majority in congress will ultimately do irreparably damage to the democratic party.","conservatives-you-want-know-what-happened-us-view","12:43 PM","government-debates","7"

What you object to is the fact that the fat cats will no longer be able to implement their welfare for the rich policies any longer. For the record, I think capital ism is a good system but that capital ists need to be kept on a very short leash.","conservatives-you-want-know-what-happened-us-view","05:14 PM","government-debates","8"

Under socialism all your needs are met and everyone is exactly the same, all you have to do is submit to being a slave to the state for the rest of your life. I think it is you who doesnt understand socialism, talk to a Russian Jew that lived under the Soviet Union sometime and explain to them how great socialism is, or someone who has lived in China or Cuba. I would like to see you explain the benefits of Socialism to the 120 million innocent people who died at the hands of Socialists in the last century. Yep I understand socialism all to well because I have talked to a Russian Jew (worked with them for 4 years) and someone who has lived in China ( person who I have known for 36 years and spent 16 years there) though I havent had the opportunity to talk to a Cuban who lived under Castro yet. Do you think their story will be any different? Though I would have liked to have known one of the 120 million innocent people killed by Socialism over the last century but I guess I will never get that chance will I?","conservatives-you-want-know-what-happened-us-view","07:22 PM","government-debates","9"

Socialism can only be maintained if the populace buys into it and keeps supporting the structures that allow it to function. Slavery is hardly a good analogy to Socialism. Care to point that out in any example from history? None of those countries are truly Communist or Socialist. China effectively abandoned its social welfare programs decades ago. It's pretty much cowboy capitalism there. Cuba is a sort of welfare state but there are serious stratification in the classes. And the USSR was an authoritarian dictatorship that violated numerous writings of Marx about Communism and Socialism. You live in a Socialist country. Police, firefighters, highways, schools and the military are all socialist programs. Furthermore, the Nordic states are full cradle to grave and when was the last time they killed anyone? Frankly, those states are panzies when it comes to punishment of criminals. So really, your question should be one of the 120 millions people (not all were innocent) killed by Authoritarian dictatorships.","conservatives-you-want-know-what-happened-us-view","10:59 PM","government-debates","13"

I told you I have worked with and know those who have, I also have worked with people who have lived under Indian socialism. I have a pretty good handle on what socialism really is. It is those like you who haven't lived under it or known anyone who has lived under it that romanticize about what they think socialism is, but this has little to with the reality of it. If socialism is so great why is it that people are not risking their lives trying to get in to socialist societies? They dont. Though they do risk their lives every day by the tens of thousands trying to get in to capitalist ones especially the US. Instead of just being envious of what someone else has. You have the same opportunity that everyone else has to get what ever it is you desire, with a little ingenuity, hard work and sacrifice you could be the next Bill Gates. All it takes is the willingness to believe in yourself and the drive to go and get it done. Under socialism though you would never get that opportunity. Why dont you, instead of complain about how unfair life is and petitioning the government to take away what someone else has worked hard their whole life and sacrificed for, so they can hand it over to you. I dont think that is very fair. In fact if it were not the government doing it I think you would call it robbery. One thing about earning your own way is that you will always respect how hard it was, and the sacrifices required to achieve it and respect everyone elses right to be able do the same. Unlike what someone who gets it handed it to them, they will squander it. Since they will never appreciate how hard it was to acheave or the sacrifices required to earn what they squander with out batting an eye they then stand there with an out streached hand waiting for more.","conservatives-you-want-know-what-happened-us-view","11:24 PM","government-debates","14"
