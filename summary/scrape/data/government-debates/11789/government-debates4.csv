It was also brutal, cruel, and created misery beyond anything we can imagine. That's not bad policy, it's evil. His murder squads enforced total govt. domination. There's no excuse for it.","conservatives-you-want-know-what-happened-us-view","10:23 PM","government-debates","46"

Murder squads? Red Brigades you mean? Are you seriously calling the red brigades murder squads like the squads that operated under the Shah of Iran?","conservatives-you-want-know-what-happened-us-view","08:07 PM","government-debates","48"

Tracking someone down specifically to flame them for your failures elsewhere is pretty sad.

Bush, of twisted IQ (clever, cunning, but not intelligent) the man who was perpetually on vacation. He NEVER mastered English and he was very proud of that fact.","conservatives-you-want-know-what-happened-us-view","12:26 PM","government-debates","52"

Besides that, I chuckle with amusement at how you use the word ""Socialism"" as though it were a BAD thing.","conservatives-you-want-know-what-happened-us-view","04:46 AM","government-debates","54"
