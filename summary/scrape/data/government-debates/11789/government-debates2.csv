Sorry, but while capitalism might be a somewhat viable economic system, Geckoesque capitalists have to be kept on a very short leash attached to a studded collar by strict government regulation.","TRIGGER","329710","chester: It wasn't the fat cats, it was our own government that scamed us or they were just to stupid to know what they were doing to us. They did it by easing loan regulations and requireing quotas for banks to meet for low income loans and fined them if they didn't meet the quotas. Heres how they did it...

Yes there are those on both sides of the isle that can hang their hat on causing this fiasco. It dosn't realy matter who was in charge of congress because a bill to correct this problem was voted down. Who is responsable are those voted against the bill. I realy don't care what party they belonged to, just that all who voted down that bill should be expelled from congress and anyone who covered up the problem should be tried and jailed.","conservatives-you-want-know-what-happened-us-view","06:24 PM","government-debates","21"

The banks didn't care that much because they thought they could flog the debt to others and in any case the interest rates were high enough that it would make up for the number of defaulters.

The CRA is what started it and it didn't really get traction till Clinton messed with it and I be leave Barney Frank had a hand in it too. For anyone to try to blame Bush or his administration for this is playing politics with everyones financial future. To side step the problem by not investigating what the cause of it was and point fingers at those who had the insight to warn congress about the impending problem and to try to fix it. For congress to ignore the problem is down right heinous. What congress did was to look at their political bottom line and ignore the health of our economy. What they did was to stab the people in the back.","conservatives-you-want-know-what-happened-us-view","11:13 AM","government-debates","24"

These FHA loans are attributed to a small portion of foreclosures (but higher as a percentage of loans given by FHA). You still have to account for the other 90% or so of foreclosures. You can't blame the republicans for everything. And if that wasn't enough...the bill was passed by UNANIMOUS CONSENT . So if you want to blame Bush, you have to blame the rest of Congress as well.
