"02-27-2004","1834",1,"None","None","None","DrD","36625","by Walter Cronkite The forthcoming presidential election will be decided on several issues of profound importance to the nation's future. It is unfortunate that the debates about them will be confounded by a religious issue that does not belong on the political agenda. The issue is same-sex marriage. A majority of our people identify themselves as Christian, and many of the faithful believe that they have a mission to pass on the word of God to those who do not believe with the same fervor as themselves. Their faith is admirable: Indeed, this might be a better world if we all obeyed our religious lessons with similar devotion. But that, of course, is not the case. And the zealots who follow the leadership of the so-called religious right are threatening us with religious war, fought on the battleground of the presidential election. The zealots are determined to make a political issue of their conviction that same-sex marriages are so immoral as to threaten the well-being of the nation, if not civilization itself. The more fanatical among them even claim that same-sex marriages would encourage homosexuality to the degree that the nation's birthrate would be endangered. They also fear that children adopted by same-sex couples will choose to follow the lifestyle of their adoptive parents and thus perpetuate, even exacerbate, what they see as the ""problem"" of homosexuality. Whatever the unlikelihood of its more drastic fears coming to pass - or of it ever successfully legislating moral behavior - the conservative Christian right is entitled to its beliefs and to its determined pursuit to criminalize same-sex marriage. Our constitutional guarantees freedom of speech, press and religion, after all. There are many of us Christians who recall our Sunday-school teachers and later our ministers dwelling upon the sympathy and respect - indeed, the tolerance - for others that, they taught, was basic to our Christian religion. As the prophet Isaiah summed up this need for tolerance: ""Come, let us reason together."" We who believe this are compelled to ask: Where is the tolerance, where is the Christian spirit in the effort to criminalize the personal choices of our fellow citizens, personal choices that do not physically threaten others? Where is the Christian tolerance in the conceit of those Christian leaders who dare suggest that they alone can be trusted to properly interpret the lessons of their Bible, and who would impose that belief on this nation's highly diverse peoples by threatening to throw them in jail if they don't agree with the Christian right's version of God's wishes? Besides wishing to criminalize individual behavior, the more radical members of the Christian right would like their proposed federal law to dictate what individual churches could do in regard to recognizing or performing same-sex marriages. This is another abomination. Shouldn't that decision be made by the individual church or denomination? What possible excuse is there for government intervention in this decision except an unreasonable, unchristian intolerance for freedom of worship? Where is the Christian tolerance in those right-wing Christian leaders who would impose their religious beliefs on the entire diverse population of the United States, even to the extent of a Constitutional amendment curtailing our rights of religious freedom? As the conservative Christian leadership presses this matter, which they depict as a moral issue, they threaten a religious war that will split our nation at a time when unity would be helpful in attacking far more critical problems - our foreign policy, the economy, education, medical care and the environment, to name a few. In the difficult days ahead, the tolerant among us - Republican, Democratic or Independent, Christian, Muslim, Jewish or nonbeliever - are going to have to try to preach another morality, and that is the morality of tolerance. http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/n...al/8017170.htm","most-christian-virtues","11:09 AM","government-debates","1"
"02-27-2004","1834",1,"None","None","None","unkerpaulie","36636","of course this article is loaded with bias, but I wont get into that first of all, opposition to homosexual marriage is not just a religious matter. it is also a legal matter and some even consider it a constitutional matter. of course the government reserves the right to revise the legal definition of ""marriage"" in its jurisdiction second, the author holds a rather stereotypical and possibly warped idea of the church. the church will continue to oppose homosexual marriage even in the event that it is legal. furthermore, the expectation that the church be absolutely tolerant of everything everybody does is a false expectation. nowhere has the church declared to tolerate all behavior or all ideas. they accept all people, but check your unchurchly behavior at the door, so to speak. third, it is not any more ""zealous"" for a religious leader to speak against homosexuality than it is for an atheist to speak against religion. both are based solely on unfounded abstract beliefs finally, your author calls for ""morality of tolerance"". the word tolerance is being used so flagrantly nowadays, people use it as a trump card when then expect they should be given the liberty to do whatever they like and get away with it. thats just not realistic. like I said in another thread, you cannot expect an institution with goals, and hence rules, to show ""absolute tolerance"". ironically enough, the position the religios right takes is no more than a personal belief. how is it wrong for them to hold their personal beliefs, while you reject their personal beliefs in the same breath you ask for tolerance of your beliefs from them?","most-christian-virtues","12:26 PM","government-debates","2"
"02-27-2004","1834",1,"DrD","None","I'm still unsure how being gay is a SIN! That was the belief at that time reported in the bible. However, other events are also in the bible which are also untrue. (mental illiness=demons, eating pork is a sin, anyone working on the sabbath shall be KILLED, and on and on.) Time and common sense change some things. Others, depending on our own prejudices, die harder. Gays AND heterosexual, do not choose their sexual orientation. Sexual orientation is not a decision. It is something that is decided for you for reasons of which we are not yet completely aware but are much more biological and chemical than ""moral"". Most gays and lesbians never HEARD of gayness until they discovered this new fact about themselves. In today's world, very few would ""choose"" to be gay because of the prejudice that still exists against gay and lesbian persons. If you are heterosexual, just ask yourself this one question, ""How and when did I choose to be straight""? The fact is that you did not choose which gender to be attracted to. No one does. I am positive that Jesus today would not condem gays the way his ""followers"" do. The saying ""WWJD"" is simple and logical for me. Just as a present-day Jesus would not endorse many of the stories and recorded incidents in the bible, neither would he condem homosexuals. Sometimes things are just to simple to believe.","unkerpaulie","36650","by definition, sin is transgressing against God's/biblical laws. if you dont subscribe to the bible, then sin is a non-entity, because 'sin' is exclusively defined based on the bible the bible is against homosexuality, therefore it is, by definition, a sin this is not true. sexual orientation is 100% psychological. nobody is born gay. if you like we could explore this with logic and evidence being aware of the term or label 'gay' has nothing to do with with whether men choose to be sexually attracted to men or not and to answer your question, everyday I choose to be straight. on any given day I can choose to be attracted to men without altering my biolgical or genetic composition but Jesus would admonish gays to ""go and sin no more"" as he did with every single 'sinner' he encountered. the choice to stop or continue their sin would be up to them, but Jesus influenced everyone that he came in contact with to change their lifestyle. you may call it intolerance, but thats what he did","most-christian-virtues","01:19 PM","government-debates","4"
"04-06-2004","1834",1,"None","None","None","CanadianBacon","42566","Wow, I must applaud your strength of will, unkerpaulie, if you are able to choose who you are attracted to. Does this mean that it doesn't matter what a woman looks like, you simply make a choice to be attracted and then it is so? Speaking for myself, and probably most other people, attraction is not a choice. If a woman is attractive to me, it doesn't mean I choose to be attracted. Rather, subconcious, biological forces cause me to be attracted. Thats why advertisements use sex as a tool to sell, because that attraction acts whether or not you choose to be attracted. I think this applies to any attraction, hetero- or homosexual. It is not a choice. Many churches have already stated their willingness to perform same-sex marriages. And I think Jesus were around now, he'd have more important things than same-sex marriage on his mind.","most-christian-virtues","09:17 AM","government-debates","5"

Unkerpaulie, if you'd care to test your theory, we MIGHT be able to find a gay man willing to be your ""chemistry set"". I thought it was a very good article, if for no other reason than it points out the error in focusing on this issue given the magnitude of the other issues surrounding the election.

"06-24-2004","1834",1,"None","None","None","Ladywolf","55454","Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a great deal from you and try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate. I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the other specific laws and how to follow them: 1. When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them? 2. I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her? 3. I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness - Lev.15:19- 24. The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense. 4. Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians? 5. I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself? 6. A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality.I don't agree. Can you settle this? 7. Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here? 8. Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev. 19:27. How should they die? 9. I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves? 10. My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? - Lev.24:10-16. Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)? I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.","most-christian-virtues","05:11 PM","government-debates","9"
