"06-26-2004","2631",1,"None","None","None","Siegfriedson","55698","How Much Does America Pay for Supporting the Israelis? by Tom Stauffer Alfred Lilienthal posed the question of what the cost of supporting Israel was to the US 40 years ago, when the price tag for Americans was low. Today the answer is knowable and daunting - the figure comes to at least $1.6 trillion through the end of 2002. That is some three times the much-publicized cost of the Vietnam War (all figures are expressed in current dollars, corrected for inflation). The overall cost to the US of all aspects of conflicts in the Middle East is even higher _ more than $2.6 trillion. But the multi-dimensioned costs of supporting and protecting Israel make up nearly two-thirds of the total. Continued: http://www.nationalvanguard.org/story.php?id=2236 The High Price of American Alliance With Israel By Lisa Guliani The U.S. government doles out more money per year to help Israeli citizens than it does to help Americans. Think about how bizarre that is for a moment. Yet, nobody DARES to challenge this openly. Okay, so I'll challenge it. And, in FY2003, our President requested ""Foreign Assistance"" funds for Israel as follows: *For Counter Terrorism for FY 2002: $28 Million *For Foreign Military Financing: $2.1 Billion *For Economic Support: $600 Million *For Refugee Settlement Funds: $60 Million Continued: http://www.federalobserver.com/archive.php?aid=5901","israel-hits-us-taxpayers-wallet","11:10 PM","government-debates","1"

Congressional researchers have disclosed that between 1974 and 1989, $16.4 billion in U.S. military loans were converted to grants and that this was the understanding from the beginning. Indeed, all past U.S. loans to Israel have eventually been forgiven by Congress, which has undoubtedly helped Israel's often-touted claim that they have never defaulted on a U.S. government loan. U.S. policy since 1984 has been that economic assistance to Israel must equal or exceed Israel's annual debt repayment to the United States. Unlike other countries, which receive aid in quarterly installments, aid to Israel since 1982 has been given in a lump sum at the beginning of the fiscal year, leaving the U.S. government to borrow from future revenues. Israel even lends some of this money back through U.S. treasury bills and collects the additional interest.

In a phone conversation on Wednesday, Ms Rice, the US national security adviser, told Mr Netanyahu, Israel's finance minister, that the White House was willing to provide $9 billion in loan guarantees to prop up Israel's sinking economy and another $1 billion in military aid. Mr Netanyahu announced the deal to the Israeli press. Full article: http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Sto...919563,00.html .","israel-hits-us-taxpayers-wallet","09:07 PM","government-debates","5"

I have no problems with Arabs or Jews that live in the Middle East - I just resent it when they invade the West in tremendous numbers like they've been doing for the last few decades. As for the Jews, I resent their grip on America's politicians and the media. They have convinced our Congressmen to send Israel billions and billions of dollars annually. As if that isn't bad enough, the Arabs know that America and Israel are in bed together, and they have attacked America repeatedly based on this fact (i.e., Sept. 11). As I told DSA devil, my view on the Palestinian/Jewish conflict is that America should declare neutrality and let the two sides resolve their differences in any way they see fit. I do believe that the Jews deserve the land of Palestine that they call Israel. They fought multiple wars and defeated their enemies in combat, therefore the Jews earned the title to that land. However, this fact does not change two things: 1) The Palestinians have the right to try to take it back 2) If the Jews want an ethnocentric Zionist state in the Middle East, that is their perogative, but they should not be utilizing billions of Gentile dollars to accomplish this task.","israel-hits-us-taxpayers-wallet","09:41 PM","government-debates","8"

So, given that you don't like them because they're not pale, do you believe that the US should expend any money on foreign aid? Given the idea that one should help support one's allies, foreign aid doesn't seem that too bad an idea. Further, if you pay a small amount now, you don't have to pay more money later, to actually go in and rescue them (which also would cost US lives).","israel-hits-us-taxpayers-wallet","01:51 AM","government-debates","9"

I highly doubt they would get over run. Israelis were able to win several wars aganist overwhelming odds without direct US support. Besides, their nukes are probably going to be used aganist other nuclear facilities. There is a reason they modified american built cruise missiles that are launched from their attack submarine to carry nuclear weapons. Someone who takes my money, backstabs me by selling my secrets to my polential enemies, and who repays me in hate is NOT my friend.
