"04-29-2005","4870",2,"Missouri Mule","None","I'd just like to remind everyone of the fact that our Constitution is not a suicide pact. We have a right and a duty to take necessary actions to prevent terrorists from succeeding as they did on 9/11. It wasn't 80 year old white haired ladies that flew those airplanes into the WTC on 9/11 and murdered 3,000 people. Common sense has to play a part in this process.","daewoo","113883","As for me, I say ""Live free or die"" is a pretty good philosophy. I woud much ratehr see half of all americans taken out by terrorists than see the next generation of Americans grow up in a neo fascist stronghold.","patriot-act-sneaky-bastards","12:13 AM","government-debates","16"

It is nonsense and it trivializes the conversation to recklessly throw around labels like this. Those 3,000 murdered Americans richly deserve our righteous indignation and revenge on a bunch of murderous fanatics. That's the least we can do. And your assertion that you would condemn 150 million Americans to death by terrorism is beneath contempt. What does that say about you? You better look in the mirror before you post such trash in the future. And you ought to hang your head in shame.","patriot-act-sneaky-bastards","01:07 AM","government-debates","17"
"04-29-2005","4870",2,"Missouri Mule","None","Bush said this war on terror would take decades. This is actually WWIV. It's not over yet.","Jo Bennett","113940","That's rather the point, it goes on for as long as Bush says it goes on for, meaning the civil liberties restrictions are permanent. To me 0.1% death rate in 10 years from terrorism is not sufficient to justify the huge restrictions on liberty.","patriot-act-sneaky-bastards","04:21 AM","government-debates","18"
"04-29-2005","4870",2,"gnojek","None","Sure was. Ammendment IV The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. Thanks for playing. Btw - I traced your IP address, hacked your computer, and found all the fetish sites you've been visiting. The FBI will be there any minute...","fracas","113962","sorry old boy but communications spans accross any person's private domain. whether it be said in public or by email. and also the act does not allow for unreasonable searches and seizure. read it again.","patriot-act-sneaky-bastards","08:13 AM","government-debates","19"

PA suspended due cause and allows search without a warrant (peek).

You seem to be following in the blind patriotic footsteps of MM and VOR. ~Federal agents may conduct surveillance and searches against U.S. citizens without ""probable cause"" to suspect criminal activity. The targeted person is not notified and cannot challenge the action. Agents can conduct ""sneak-and-peek"" searches without prior notice in common domestic crime investigations. Before the Patriot Act, courts required law enforcement to ""knock and announce"" themselves before conducting searches. Government agents now have access to any person's business or personal records. These include library records, book-buying habits, medical, marital counseling or psychiatric files, business records, Internet habits, and credit reports. The government no longer has to give notice, obtain a warrant or a subpoena, or show probable cause that a crime has been committed. Persons turning over personal data to the government (such as librarians, co-workers or neighbors) are prohibited, under threat of federal criminal prosecution, from telling anyone they did so.~","patriot-act-sneaky-bastards","02:53 PM","government-debates","25"
"05-03-2005","4870",2,"gamehuis","None","[i]THE U.N. HUMAN FREEDOM INDEX The United Nation's Human Freedom Index compares the amount of freedom that citizens of different countries enjoy. It considers the right to travel, assemble, and speak; the absence of forced labor, torture and other extreme legal punishment (such as the death penalty); freedom of political opposition, the press and trade unions; an independent judiciary; gender equality; and the legal right to trial, counsel of choice, privacy, religion and sexual practice.","CvT","116046","Whenever I see something sponsored by the UN, it demands a close read. So let's check the criteria a little more thoroughly. A right to travel? Where? For what purpose. Seems a little vague, but okay. I find it interesting that societies that put heinous criminals to death are less ""free"" than those that let them walk. The death penalty doesn't make one any less free - unless you consider rape and murder essential freedoms. Once again you're arguing forms of government rather than actual freedom, but okay. Good grief. Does this mean that if enough women aren't in the boardroom you have to shut down the company? Sounds fishy to me. Ah yes, the usual vague ""privacy"" and ""sexual practice"" freedoms. Whatever floats your boat, I guess. Looking over the list, I can't help but notice a rather important right that didn't make the cut: The right to self defense. You know, the most basic human freedom out there. Why am I not surprised that the UN left this foundational right off the list, but included ""gender equality.""","patriot-act-sneaky-bastards","04:35 PM","government-debates","27"
"05-03-2005","4870",2,"None","None","None","gamehuis","116068","You're right that the freedom to defend yourself should be on that list, but your comments on some of the other things are deliberately obtuse, like the gender equality thing. You know what it means, so saying things like: ""Good grief. Does this mean that if enough women aren't in the boardroom you have to shut down the company? Sounds fishy to me."" really isn't necessary.","patriot-act-sneaky-bastards","04:50 PM","government-debates","28"
