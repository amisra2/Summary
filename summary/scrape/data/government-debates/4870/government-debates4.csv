Many anti-terrorism powers in the UK and US do not require proof before a court. They can and have been used to go after peaceful protestors.","patriot-act-sneaky-bastards","01:42 PM","government-debates","46"

My answer was always that ultimate power was never supposed to be in the hands of the Government... it was not meant to be in any one entitys hands... as these laws get passed.. we are moving closer to this.

I understand why people go Waco ...I mean Wacko. One by one..kiss your rights goodbye. I have lived in other countries... We are not free here. We are many things...but free is hardly one of them.","deathlord52","138820","9/11 scared the sheeple into giving up freedom for security.
