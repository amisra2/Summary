You seem to be following in the blind patriotic footsteps of MM and VOR. ~Federal agents may conduct surveillance and searches against U.S. citizens without ""probable cause"" to suspect criminal activity. The targeted person is not notified and cannot challenge the action. Agents can conduct ""sneak-and-peek"" searches without prior notice in common domestic crime investigations. Before the Patriot Act, courts required law enforcement to ""knock and announce"" themselves before conducting searches. Government agents now have access to any person's business or personal records. These include library records, book-buying habits, medical, marital counseling or psychiatric files, business records, Internet habits, and credit reports. The government no longer has to give notice, obtain a warrant or a subpoena, or show probable cause that a crime has been committed. Persons turning over personal data to the government (such as librarians, co-workers or neighbors) are prohibited, under threat of federal criminal prosecution, from telling anyone they did so.~","patriot-act-sneaky-bastards","02:53 PM","government-debates","25"

So let's check the criteria a little more thoroughly. A right to travel? Where? For what purpose. Seems a little vague, but okay. I find it interesting that societies that put heinous criminals to death are less ""free"" than those that let them walk. The death penalty doesn't make one any less free - unless you consider rape and murder essential freedoms. Once again you're arguing forms of government rather than actual freedom, but okay. Good grief. Does this mean that if enough women aren't in the boardroom you have to shut down the company? Sounds fishy to me. Ah yes, the usual vague ""privacy"" and ""sexual practice"" freedoms. Whatever floats your boat, I guess. Looking over the list, I can't help but notice a rather important right that didn't make the cut: The right to self defense.
