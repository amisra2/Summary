The attitude towards flagburning in itself are one of the issues that point towards it.","Phunting","41015","C'mon XeoX, surely you know that the US is the only country to support freedom of speech I quite agree. And personally I agree with most people's view. Flagburning is a form of protest and should never be restrained. That said I don't approve of it, and would never burn a British, American or any other flag.","flag-burning","01:15 PM","government-debates","76"
"03-27-2004","43",6,"Calligirl","None","The American flag is a national symbol of our freedom. It was first created when we won the war against England. By burning it, we are plainly saying that we don't support the country to which we owe our liberty. What about all of the people who gave their lives, that our nation might live? It is not only disrespectful to their sacrifice, it is also showing that we do not support our country.","porsteamboy","41281","The American flag is a symbol of States United under the Constitution, without the Constitution the flag is nothing more than a pretty cloth. Not one person fought for the flag, you take an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and thats what they fought for. We owe nothing to this country for our liberties, the country owes the people, for they are the ones who fought and died for our libertry. People can burn the flag day and night, does not effect the Constitution in any way, part of that Constitution is freedom of expression, now if you pass a law against burning the flag you've weakend the Constitution and the symbol has no meaning. You have a weakend Constitution and a strong symbol, a symbol of what! Remember to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and DOMESTIC.","flag-burning","11:23 AM","government-debates","77"

Today this kid at school was wearing the flag tied like a cape and he had written on it, colored in the stars... well he sat down in the middle of the lunch room and just sat there reading his book. Well he was sent to the office and now has out of school suspension. People seem to make a huge deal about the flag and yes I can see why, it's our choice to say the pledge at school so why not have the choice to wear it if you want?","flag-burning","09:38 PM","government-debates","79"

And why would anyone say it should be illegal to specifically burn the American flag? That's pretty arrogant. It would be terrible of we were not permitted to peacefully protest by burning symbols. You cannot force someone to show respect by law. That's called being a fascist.","flag-burning","11:26 AM","government-debates","80"
