This is a different issue but I think we owe it to lesser fortunate countries to bite the hand that feeds. We should feel an OBLIGATION to the unfortunate masses out there that would give their left leg for a bowl of rice to stand against the wrongs of this country. While they are dying off, we use ignorance as a scorn to enfore imperialistic views and live like pigs. It should be unargueably incumbent of us to have a sense of CIVIL disobediance! Now you know I have every RIGHT to burn your ""sacred"" cloth anytime I well please. Ok, so they illegalize flag burning, but where does this stop? They can violate our natural rights as HUMANS, where does that end?? Next they will make it illegal to have a liberal view, then it be illegal to protest, then you will lose the right to, as in an individual, think for yourself. But you know...it's too bad because Big Brother is always watching... Now I know a lot of you will start crying about this because haha YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE U.S.!! WOOOO!!!!!!","flag-burning","04:25 PM","government-debates","61"

A friend of mine set his ex wifes wedding dress on fire at a drunken bye bye bit$h party, does that mean he was violating the sanctity of marriage? Or was he perhaps just showing distain.","flag-burning","12:16 AM","government-debates","62"

Hundreds have died protecting the flag itself. Many of these men were awarded the medal of honor for not allowing the flag to fall in combat. It is the difinitive symbol of our country and our freedom. As much as I hate the act of burning the flag it is overridden by a much stronger principle. The freedom of individual expression. I think it would set a very dangerous precident for the future if we passed an amendment to the constitution that violated our right to free speach. Therefore flag burning should not be made illegal in this country. I do have a question though since there are so many interested in consitutional law here. If we did pass an amendment banning flag burning. Could the supreme court strike that amendment down if it found that it was in violation of the bill of rights?","flag-burning","06:41 AM","government-debates","63"

Would you think it a valid form of protest for an American to say - burn a North Korean flag?","flag-burning","04:08 AM","government-debates","64"

"02-18-2004","43",5,"Calligirl","None","Flag burning should definitely be against the law. (Well, burning the American flag should be against the law at least.) How disrespectful is that? That would be like burning a Bible. (Which isn't against the law, either.)","popsi101","35099","the whole reason people burn the flags is to by disrespectful!!!! they're destroying what is most important to this country to show their hate for the country and it should be legal cuz it's a form of expression called ""symbolic speech."" ever heard of freedom of speech and freedom of expression???","flag-burning","02:58 AM","government-debates","68"
"03-06-2004","43",5,"thistownwilleat","None","You said it Calli the flag is a symbol of freedom, one of the most important being the freedom of speech.

(1st amendment )","XeoX","38456","You obviously doesnt know much about other countries. I burned an american flag at new years eve. It was not to show hate against the country, neither was it to show disrespect for the people who have fought in the very, very few wars that I feel it was justified of the U.S to fight. It was to protest against all the things in america and all the things america does that I feel is wrong (and thats a lot) and more than anything to protest against the americans refusal to accept that they do so much wrong things, their rufusal to accept that there are other countries with as much freedom as theirs and their unhealthy patriotism and conviction of the righteousness of their country. The flag is a symbol of I belive the biggest problem in america. The overpropotionate patriotism. The attitude towards flagburning in itself are one of the issues that point towards it. Note that I do not speak for all americans. Im not a bigot. This is more of a mentality that I belive is both widespread and harmful.","flag-burning","08:19 AM","government-debates","69"
"03-06-2004","43",5,"gilligan8503","None","flag buring is a warning to the government, ""continue to agrivate us or we will initiate our right to overthrow the government ."" when the government starts to tell you what to do, when to do it, and how to do it, that is a sure sign of a conversion into a totalitarian government. i own the flag; i burn the flag. my property; my right.","jim's trucking","38494","You do not have the right to overthrow or to attempt to overthrow the government. When you are old enough, you will have the right to vote your preference to try to change the government. Attempting to overthrow the government is treason, punishable by death. Regarding the question at hand, it is not and should not be illegal to burn the US flag. Burning is, in fact, the preferred method of retiring a flag. http://www.quinnflags.com/flagEtiquette.asp http://www.anchorflagandflagpole.com...OVMTC=standard Retiring the Flag From Service ""The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem of display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning."" (The United States Flag Code) The flag should be burned in private at a private, non-public location. In many American communities, one or more organizations render an important community service by collecting and overseeing the proper disposal of old, worn, tattered, frayed and/or faded U.S. Flags. For information in your community try the Boy Scouts of America, Veterans of Foreign Wars, or the American Legion. If they provide a flag retirement service the flag can be dropped off and they will take care of the ceremony. A flag retirement ceremony may also be a family activity. It provides an opportunity to teach and instruct. If retiring the flag as a family the following steps might be considered: 1 Gather the family around. Raise the flag on the pole or staff or hold it aloft by hand. 2. Call the group to attention salute and recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag. 3. The leader might say something like ""This flag has served its nation well and long. It is now worn to a condition in which it should no longer be used to represent the nation. We pay honor to this flag for the service it has rendered."" 4. Fold the flag according to procedures explained on this site 5. Give the flag to the group leader who will burn it until it is completely consumed.","flag-burning","02:03 PM","government-debates","70"

I personally believe that burning a US flag on US soil should be illegal. {If you're doing it in a way that disrespect the flag, the proper way to retire a flag is to solemnly tear it into even strips and burn it one piece at a time} Like it was said before, men have died because they stood by and gaurded the flag instead of running. The flag needs to be honored. Now burning another countries flag - well, I think you should honor they're flag, if you expect them to honor yours. {I make an exception for Nazi's.

And what did those men die for? They died to protect America's freedoms. One of those freedoms is the freedom to express yourself however you choose, provided that it does not harm or interfere with others. Flag burning does not harm anyone and in most cases, it does not interfere with others. (And if it does, it is not the flag burning that is the problem, it is something else, such as the place where they are burning the flag, that is the problem). Therefore, I see no reason to ban burning the American flag.","flag-burning","07:42 PM","government-debates","73"
"03-12-2004","43",5,"None","None","None","Nallyo","39406","I think that it's a slap across the face of the veterans that fought to preserve our freedoms. While I can see the argument that this is the freedom that they fought so hard to preserve, I think that many veterans would see it a different way. Do you really need to burn the American Flag to make a point? We have the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances, why is that not enough? Remember, in the Civil War days and in the other wars before the 20th century, the flagbearer was one of the most honored positions of the army. He was the person who soldiers could rally around. He was the person who could galvanize an assault forward, or let men know that a retreat was more in order. Since he was the most visible, he was also the most frequently targeted. When that man fell, and the flag began to descend to the ground, another would hurry over to raise it high once again. Why was there such respect for it? After all, no one hurried over to the bugle when that guy was gunned down, even though it served much the same purpose of the flag in terms of advance and retreat.","flag-burning","08:32 PM","government-debates","74"

The flag is a symbol of the country, very often used in war to show a country's progress. However, it is only a symbol. By itself, it means nothing. (Try defining American flag without using America, the United States, or any other term that is commonly used as a name for the US. I doubt you could give it the same meaning.) Burning the flag is only another symbol. Its meaning is only interpretation. Personally, I would never burn the American flag. I agree that it will probably be interpreted as a slap in the face to veterans. However, there are things that people do that I can take as a slap in the face to me, but I doubt you would want to ban them, too. The solution for problems with free speech is free speech, not limited speech.","flag-burning","10:48 PM","government-debates","75"
