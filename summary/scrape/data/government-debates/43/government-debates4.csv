"06-09-2003","43",4,"None","None","None","John Calhoun","9377","""So they were misled. My heart bleeds."" Not remarking on the poor forensics, how could they POSSIBLY be 'misled' when they (the sovreign States) were the parties that wrote the Constitution? ""But I think court cases are VERY relevant. In this case, they say that the contract the states entered into when they joined the union was irrevocable. That seems to be slightly relevant to me."" To say that anything created by men is eternal is blasphemous. Only Jehovah God Almighty can create an eternal covenant. "" Furthermore, and this is key, the states can't reserve a power they never had in the first place. Since the states couldn't secede from the United States before they entered into it (it didn't exist yet!) they couldn't ""reserve"" the power. This was a key finding in the White case."" Sophistry worthy of Emperor Abraham I. They reserved the right to re-assume all rights and powers delegated to the new central Government, which was (and still is) perfectly within their ability as sovreign States. The powers of the central government were delegated to it with the understanding that if the new government (or a cabal of States in the Congress) were ever to usurp these powers and attempt to use them to oppress other States, the States which felt oppressed could withdraw from the compact sine die. This was openly discussed and contemplated with some regularity in the 1st 1/2 of the 19th Century; the Hartford Convention and MA's passage of an ordinance of Secession through one house of the Legislature to name but two examples are met with scarcely a second thought in documents of the era. Why? Because the right of withdrawal was considered to be so obvious as to not require debate. If SC and my illustrious namesake had passed an Ordinance of Secession rather than an Ordinance of Nullification as they did in 1832, I have a strong suspicion that there would have been far les hue and cry raised. Why? Secession is not a threat to the existing Union, as it does not affect those States wishing to remain in the compact. Nullification, on the other hand, is a direct XXXX at the existing Union, as it challenges a power specifically delegated to the central Government in the body of the Constitution. As I am fond of saying, ""A Union held together by bayonets is no Union.""","flag-burning","01:31 AM","government-debates","50"
"06-09-2003","43",4,"None","None","None","John Calhoun","9404","""I don't see the sophistry. The states gave powers to a central govt.. Those powers are the governments to keep. "" Not in a representative republic they aren't. Ever hear of this novel concept called ""the consent of the governed""? In a representative Constitutional republic, government serves with the consent of the governed. As long as the governed consent to government, government has power. Once they no longer consent (as the 11 States did in Dec 1860-Spring 1861 and as the 4 I cited specifically reserved the right to in their ratification of the Constitution), all bets are off. What you describe is an empire, dictatorship, or monarchy. ""If you give me an apple, you can't reclaim it no matter what i decide to do with it. "" I sure can reclaim said apple. I can ask you for it, and if you refuse, I can resort to other means. ""If you agree to exist under a higher authority, its meaningless of you can leave whenever you wish."" This is almost so simple as to astound me that it requires explaination. We only agree to exist under a higher authority as long as we agree to exist under said authority. When we no longer so agree, we leave that authority in favor of one more suited to our ends. ""And would you PLEASE answer my priv. and immunities analysis?"" The appropriate part of the 14A: No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; Art. 4, Sect 2, USC: The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states. The Priveleges and Immunities Clause of the 14A was not new law. As a restatement of Art 4, Sect. 2, it merely applies to the Central Government, and not to internal institutions of the individual States with no legitimate effect on the several States as a whole (i.e. civic issues like flag burning,and all other issues not specifically covered in the Constitution)","flag-burning","03:31 PM","government-debates","52"
"08-21-2003","43",4,"None","None","None","Goturuge","13455","OK, before I state my opinion on this matter allow me to apologize for brining up a somewhat old topic. I have done this simply because I have recently written a short essay on the topic, and I would like to toss my own opinion in this topic. I do not say much around here, usually I just lurk, but I enjoy debating this topic. Once again, forgive me for dragging up a seemingly dead thread. This topic has reminded me of a news story I read several months ago. In it a highschool girl (a senior, I believe) would turn her back away from the United States flag while the National Anthem played before a basketball game commenced. Through this act she displayed her opposition to the current acts performed and decisions made by the US government. During the middle of her game, while she stood before the basketball goal preparing to take a free shot, a vietnam war veteran ran onto the court with a flag in hand. He began waving the flag in front of her face and screaming of its significance. Eventually security of some sort escorted the man away from the girl and out of the building. Click here for the story from my local newspaper. In my history class we would discuss current events every Thursday. Each student would bring in a news clipping of some sort, stapled onto a sheet of notebook paper describing the story the student had chosen. When we began discussing this particular story a great majority of the class took sides with the old man, and I understand why. A Nation's flag holds many representations. Without going into too much detail, it can represent the past, the present, and the future. It represents the past by serving as a reminder to those who faught for the country and its purpose. It represents the present through current events. The current mode and happenings of the country, whether good or bad. Then it represents the future. The goals of the country and where the country might find itself headed can hold a very strong representation through the flag. This a flag holds, and much more. One of the strongest reasons for opposition to flag burning and any general disrespect to a nation's flag (particularly the flag of the United States) regards the represenation of the past. One may constantly hear that so many people have died for the freedom or life that a person experiences in their country at present, and through disrespect of the flag they show disrespect to these people. While this sounds like a very lovely idea, and I can understand it more than one might expect, I do not think this should act as a reason that keeps one from demonstrating their disgruntlement with the affairs of their country. Using the United States as an example, let us say an old man tells me that I should not disrespect the flag because so many people have faught and died for my freedoms. Does this statement not contradict itself? Does their dying for my freedoms, including the freedom of speech (through a number of ways, not just through using the voice), restrict me from excercising these freedoms to their fullest extent? I think I can burn a flag, rip a flag, or throw a flag away without showing disrespect to those who died to keep my freedoms secured. If I do not wish to accept or agree with what I find my government currently doing, could I not use a symbol of the government in its present state to act also as a symbol of my displeasement with the government? Could I not use a symbol respresenting a government's possible future also as a symbol for my irritation as to what direction the government appears to currently go? If I wish to make a strong statement through symbolism would my statement not become stronger by using a nation's symbol as my own symbol--against that nation? If a flag represents the freedoms so many people have faught and died for then the restriction of one of these freedoms would have caused so many people to die in vain. As I have had many people tell me, thousands of men and women have died so that I may have the freedoms I have now. In order to honor these people for their acts of bravery, I will use those freedoms. I will fight against the restriction of any of those freedoms. I will do my best to see that those people have not died in vain. If it means I will get sent to prison or suffer any other form of punishment brought on by my government--I would consider that government as the eviler force. I would consider that government as the one disrespecting those who have died for that country. Goturuge","flag-burning","10:25 PM","government-debates","57"
