Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 the answer is ""No."" As for my personal opinion, I have not decided completely. Anyone want to convince me???","flag-burning","09:48 PM","government-debates","2"

How disrespectful is that? That would be like burning a Bible. (Which isn't against the law, either.)","flag-burning","09:52 PM","government-debates","3"

"01-27-2003","43",1,"None","None","None","Calligirl","148","The American flag is a national symbol of our freedom. It was first created when we won the war against England. By burning it, we are plainly saying that we don't support the country to which we owe our liberty. What about all of the people who gave their lives, that our nation might live? It is not only disrespectful to their sacrifice, it is also showing that we do not support our country.","flag-burning","10:45 PM","government-debates","5"
"01-27-2003","43",1,"None","None","None","thistownwilleat","153","You said it Calli the flag is a symbol of freedom, one of the most important being the freedom of speech. It's what makes us different than any other country, these freedoms. And when you take them away you are doing far worse than burning a piece of cloth, you are turning directly around and walking away from what makes the flag important. It's not only paradoxical, but hypocritical.","flag-burning","11:23 PM","government-debates","6"

"04-21-2003","43",1,"None","None","None","wjim1269","6997","Although I agree with Calli that many don't see it this way, Veterans should feel honored when the flag is burned. It shows that what they fought for (freedom) still exits in America.","flag-burning","10:49 PM","government-debates","13"
"04-23-2003","43",1,"None","None","None","Patriot","7094","I would humbly like to point out: 1. Presidential assasination is a form of protest. 2. What 19 terrorists did on September 11 was a form of protest. Therefore, it cannot be said that ALL forms of protest are appropriate, or should be legal.","flag-burning","02:10 PM","government-debates","14"
