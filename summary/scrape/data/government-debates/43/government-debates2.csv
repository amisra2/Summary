There is no law prohibiting flag burning, and such a law would not be supported by the constitution.","flag-burning","09:09 PM","government-debates","19"
"04-25-2003","43",2,"None","None","None","thistownwilleat","7175","""...not all forms of protest are appropriate or desireable."" Well we don't make laws that limit the First Amendment based on what is appropriate and desirable. There is NO form of pure protest that is illegal, and there never should be.","flag-burning","10:07 AM","government-debates","20"

"05-02-2003","43",2,"None","None","None","SparkleSocks22","7548","Well I was actually pondering this a few days ago but not about burning the flag but cutting it up for an art project. I told my Mom about this and she told me that people would definitly have a problem with it, and it would be taken down because of cutting the flag into two or more seperate pieces, but isn't it my first amendment right to do that? The school has taken down many art projects because they have things that might be ""just a little bit iffy.""","flag-burning","07:24 PM","government-debates","22"
"05-02-2003","43",2,"None","None","None","wjim1269","7563","Well, now that I've said that I am against laws banning flag burning, I'm probably going to baffle your minds. I do think we should show respect for the flag. Personally, I will never burn a flag, although I feel I should have the right to do so if I please. I'm not really sure on how to respond to your question, Sparkle. Yes, people might find it disrespectful to the flag, but I believe it is your right to do it. However, the school is probably trying to 'not offend anyone,' which personally I think is impossible.","flag-burning","09:06 PM","government-debates","23"
"06-03-2003","43",2,"None","None","None","SilentPoet","8846","Burning your countries flag or any other countries flag should be legal if. 1. You own the flag 2. Your not violating the rights of others wjim1269 : ""Forms of protest that involve destroying other people's property and/or murdering people are illegal because of the laws that restrict you from destroying other people's property or murdering people. There is no law prohibiting flag burning, and such a law would not be supported by the constitution."" Those are the kind of rights I'm talking about... In my opinion there is no reason this should be illegal. I myself have never burned a flag as part of any form of demonstration nor do I plan to, but I don't condemn others for doing it. If you disagree please reply to this post and state your reason(s) Thanks for reading this Always Stay Open Minded","flag-burning","06:01 PM","government-debates","24"

"06-04-2003","43",2,"None","None","None","SparkleSocks22","8944","So if I did cut up a flag for artistic purposes then that would be alright? I'm sure someone would have something to say, but they can't NOT hang it up at the art show(s) because it's cut up...I mean the whole flag will be on it just cut in half.","flag-burning","02:22 PM","government-debates","26"

"06-04-2003","43",2,"None","None","None","wjim1269","8987","It is actually in violation of the rules for proper display of a flag. However, these are only recommendations, and they are not laws. (i.e. if you violate one of them, you can't be held for a crime.) Regarding your situation: Cutting the flag as part of an art work is allowable, although it would probably violate the rules I mentioned above. I do think that your first amendment rights would be violated if they refused to accept your artwork. However, the art show could still refuse to accept it and you would be basically SOL because the only way you could enforce your 1st amendment right (if you even wanted to go that far), would be to take them to court, and by the time your case would come up the show would be over. To make my point much shorter, you COULD cut the flag for your artwork, and it would probably be a 1st amendment violation if you did and they didn't allow it , but I wouldn't recommend you do it.","flag-burning","10:07 PM","government-debates","29"
"06-04-2003","43",2,"None","None","None","SparkleSocks22","8990","But what if I was using the flag cut into two pieces as really an honor for the flag? It's not like I was going to cut it up and write IRAQ FOREVER or something...I was using it as a sign of peace in my artwork...I think if I DID cut it up there would be a huge up roar seeing as they took down someone's picture of Bob Marly smoking pot and another picture of someone nude....*sigh* Well it's art...I think I'm still going to do it, but only portray it in a very honorable way and not in a way where I am actually TRYING to offend someone, because I am not. It's just art to me, and the flag is a great piece to incorporate in your art.","flag-burning","10:16 PM","government-debates","30"
