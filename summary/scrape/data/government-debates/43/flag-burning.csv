Regarding your situation: Cutting the flag as part of an art work is allowable, although it would probably violate the rules I mentioned above. I do think that your first amendment rights would be violated if they refused to accept your artwork. However, the art show could still refuse to accept it and you would be basically SOL because the only way you could enforce your 1st amendment right (if you even wanted to go that far), would be to take them to court, and by the time your case would come up the show would be over.

There, the rule was established that where: 1) Speech is directed at an individual or a small minority and 2) The speech is of such a nature that an average member of the community would react with violence in the circumstances then the speech is not protected. I would go a step farther. When one studies the history of the Constitutional Convention, the original Bill Of Rights and the ratification statements of the States (specifically Virginia), one is forced to the conclusion that the Constitution and Bill Of Rights are not applicable to the States, but merely to the central Government. Given this fact, the State of South Carolina (or any other) could easily criminalize flag burning as a felony with punishment of 5-10 in State prison, as long as there is no 1A-like provision in the State constitution.

"06-05-2003","43",3,"None","None","None","John Calhoun","9061","First, for the uninitiated, a few choice exerpts from Barron v. Baltimore: ""The question thus presented is, we think, of great importance, but not of much difficulty. The Constitution was ordained and established by the people of the United States for themselves, for their own government, and not for the government of the individual States ."" *** ""If these propositions be correct, the fifth amendment must be understood as restraining the power of the General Government, not as applicable to the States."" *** ""The counsel for the plaintiff in error insists that the Constitution was intended to secure the people of the several States against the undue exercise of power by their respective State governments, as well as against that which might be attempted by their General Government. It support of this argument he relies on the inhibitions contained in the tenth section of the first article. We think that section affords a strong, if not a conclusive , argument in support of the opinion already indicated by the court. "" *** ""We are of opinion that the provision in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution declaring that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation is intended solely as a limitation on the exercise of power by the [p*251] Government of the United States, and is not applicable to the legislation of the States. "" Were this all that was said, it might well be sufficient. However, the Framers themselves were quite specific as to their view of the proper division of power between the States and the Central Government. VA Ratification, US Constitution: ""WE the Delegates of the people of Virginia, duly elected in pursuance of a recommendation from the General Assembly...DO in the name and in behalf of the people of Virginia, declare and make known that the powers granted under the Constitution, being derived from the people of the United States may be resumed by them whensoever the same shall be perverted to their injury or oppression, and that every power not granted thereby remains with them and at their will: ...and that among other essential rights, the liberty of conscience and of the press cannot be cancelled, abridged, restrained or modified by any authority of the United States."" NY Ratification, US Constitution: ""That the powers of government may be reassumed by the people whensoever it shall become necessary to their happiness; that every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by the said Constitution clearly delegated to the Congress of the United States, or the departments of the government thereof, remains to the people of the several states, or to their respective state governments, to whom they may have granted the same; and that those clauses in the said Constitution, which declare that Congress shall not have or exercise certain powers, do not imply that Congress is entitled to any powers not given by the said Constitution; but such clauses are to be construed either as exceptions to certain specified powers, or as inserted merely for greater caution."" Rhode Island ratification, US Constitution: ""III. That the powers of government may be reassumed by the people whensoever it shall become necessary to their happiness. That the rights of the states respectively to nominate and appoint all state officers, and every other power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by the said Constitution clearly delegated to the Congress of the United States, or to the departments of government thereof, remain to the people of the several states, or their respective state governments, to whom they may have granted the same; and that those clauses in the Constitution which declare that Congress shall not have or exercise certain powers, do not imply that Congress is entitled to any powers not given by the said Constitution; but such clauses are to be construed as exceptions to certain specified powers, or as inserted merely for greater caution."" South Carolina ratification, US Constitution: ""This Convention doth also declare, that no section or paragraph of the said Constitution warrants a construction that the states do not retain every power not expressly relinquished by them, and vested in the general government of the Union ."" And finally, a near-forgotten section of the United States Constitution, the 10th Amendment: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. With all this said, I see no legal, Constitutional way to criminalize flag burning BUT at the State, County, Parish (for those in the sovreign State of Louisana) or Municipal government. And providing the State constitution in question has a free speech protection, the law must be made at the County, Parish, or Municipal level. If the County or Parish ordinances have a similar Free Speech protection, then the law must fall at the municipal level. And if a municipality has a free speech provision, then there may be no restriction of flag burning in that particular municipality.","flag-burning","07:14 PM","government-debates","37"

In this case, they say that the contract the states entered into when they joined the union was irrevocable. That seems to be slightly relevant to me."" To say that anything created by men is eternal is blasphemous. Only Jehovah God Almighty can create an eternal covenant. "" Furthermore, and this is key, the states can't reserve a power they never had in the first place. Since the states couldn't secede from the United States before they entered into it (it didn't exist yet!) they couldn't ""reserve"" the power. This was a key finding in the White case."" Sophistry worthy of Emperor Abraham I. They reserved the right to re-assume all rights and powers delegated to the new central Government, which was (and still is) perfectly within their ability as sovreign States. The powers of the central government were delegated to it with the understanding that if the new government (or a cabal of States in the Congress) were ever to usurp these powers and attempt to use them to oppress other States, the States which felt oppressed could withdraw from the compact sine die. This was openly discussed and contemplated with some regularity in the 1st 1/2 of the 19th Century; the Hartford Convention and MA's passage of an ordinance of Secession through one house of the Legislature to name but two examples are met with scarcely a second thought in documents of the era. Why? Because the right of withdrawal was considered to be so obvious as to not require debate. If SC and my illustrious namesake had passed an Ordinance of Secession rather than an Ordinance of Nullification as they did in 1832, I have a strong suspicion that there would have been far les hue and cry raised. Why? Secession is not a threat to the existing Union, as it does not affect those States wishing to remain in the compact. Nullification, on the other hand, is a direct XXXX at the existing Union, as it challenges a power specifically delegated to the central Government in the body of the Constitution.

"08-21-2003","43",4,"None","None","None","Goturuge","13455","OK, before I state my opinion on this matter allow me to apologize for brining up a somewhat old topic. I have done this simply because I have recently written a short essay on the topic, and I would like to toss my own opinion in this topic. I do not say much around here, usually I just lurk, but I enjoy debating this topic. Once again, forgive me for dragging up a seemingly dead thread. This topic has reminded me of a news story I read several months ago. In it a highschool girl (a senior, I believe) would turn her back away from the United States flag while the National Anthem played before a basketball game commenced. Through this act she displayed her opposition to the current acts performed and decisions made by the US government. During the middle of her game, while she stood before the basketball goal preparing to take a free shot, a vietnam war veteran ran onto the court with a flag in hand. He began waving the flag in front of her face and screaming of its significance. Eventually security of some sort escorted the man away from the girl and out of the building. Click here for the story from my local newspaper. In my history class we would discuss current events every Thursday. Each student would bring in a news clipping of some sort, stapled onto a sheet of notebook paper describing the story the student had chosen. When we began discussing this particular story a great majority of the class took sides with the old man, and I understand why. A Nation's flag holds many representations. Without going into too much detail, it can represent the past, the present, and the future. It represents the past by serving as a reminder to those who faught for the country and its purpose. It represents the present through current events. The current mode and happenings of the country, whether good or bad. Then it represents the future. The goals of the country and where the country might find itself headed can hold a very strong representation through the flag. This a flag holds, and much more. One of the strongest reasons for opposition to flag burning and any general disrespect to a nation's flag (particularly the flag of the United States) regards the represenation of the past. One may constantly hear that so many people have died for the freedom or life that a person experiences in their country at present, and through disrespect of the flag they show disrespect to these people. While this sounds like a very lovely idea, and I can understand it more than one might expect, I do not think this should act as a reason that keeps one from demonstrating their disgruntlement with the affairs of their country. Using the United States as an example, let us say an old man tells me that I should not disrespect the flag because so many people have faught and died for my freedoms. Does this statement not contradict itself? Does their dying for my freedoms, including the freedom of speech (through a number of ways, not just through using the voice), restrict me from excercising these freedoms to their fullest extent? I think I can burn a flag, rip a flag, or throw a flag away without showing disrespect to those who died to keep my freedoms secured. If I do not wish to accept or agree with what I find my government currently doing, could I not use a symbol of the government in its present state to act also as a symbol of my displeasement with the government? Could I not use a symbol respresenting a government's possible future also as a symbol for my irritation as to what direction the government appears to currently go? If I wish to make a strong statement through symbolism would my statement not become stronger by using a nation's symbol as my own symbol--against that nation? If a flag represents the freedoms so many people have faught and died for then the restriction of one of these freedoms would have caused so many people to die in vain. As I have had many people tell me, thousands of men and women have died so that I may have the freedoms I have now. In order to honor these people for their acts of bravery, I will use those freedoms. I will fight against the restriction of any of those freedoms. I will do my best to see that those people have not died in vain. If it means I will get sent to prison or suffer any other form of punishment brought on by my government--I would consider that government as the eviler force. I would consider that government as the one disrespecting those who have died for that country. Goturuge","flag-burning","10:25 PM","government-debates","57"

Regarding the question at hand, it is not and should not be illegal to burn the US flag. Burning is, in fact, the preferred method of retiring a flag. http://www.quinnflags.com/flagEtiquette.asp http://www.anchorflagandflagpole.com...OVMTC=standard Retiring the Flag From Service ""The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem of display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning."" (The United States Flag Code) The flag should be burned in private at a private, non-public location. In many American communities, one or more organizations render an important community service by collecting and overseeing the proper disposal of old, worn, tattered, frayed and/or faded U.S. Flags. For information in your community try the Boy Scouts of America, Veterans of Foreign Wars, or the American Legion. If they provide a flag retirement service the flag can be dropped off and they will take care of the ceremony. A flag retirement ceremony may also be a family activity. It provides an opportunity to teach and instruct. If retiring the flag as a family the following steps might be considered: 1 Gather the family around. Raise the flag on the pole or staff or hold it aloft by hand. 2. Call the group to attention salute and recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag. 3. The leader might say something like ""This flag has served its nation well and long. It is now worn to a condition in which it should no longer be used to represent the nation. We pay honor to this flag for the service it has rendered."" 4. Fold the flag according to procedures explained on this site 5. Give the flag to the group leader who will burn it until it is completely consumed.","flag-burning","02:03 PM","government-debates","70"

The flag is a symbol of the country, very often used in war to show a country's progress. However, it is only a symbol. By itself, it means nothing. (Try defining American flag without using America, the United States, or any other term that is commonly used as a name for the US. I doubt you could give it the same meaning.) Burning the flag is only another symbol. Its meaning is only interpretation. Personally, I would never burn the American flag. I agree that it will probably be interpreted as a slap in the face to veterans.
