If you want to go ahead and do it, that's fine. Just be aware that it could be taken down as possibly offensive to someone, and that even though it probably is a 1st amend. violation, there will be little that you could do about it.","flag-burning","10:36 PM","government-debates","31"
"06-05-2003","43",3,"None","None","None","John Calhoun","9005","Political speech is that class of speech most closely guarded by the 1A. That said, the Supreme COurt has recognized boundaries to this right; the Chaplinsky case leaps to mind. There, the rule was established that where: 1) Speech is directed at an individual or a small minority and 2) The speech is of such a nature that an average member of the community would react with violence in the circumstances then the speech is not protected. I would go a step farther. When one studies the history of the Constitutional Convention, the original Bill Of Rights and the ratification statements of the States (specifically Virginia), one is forced to the conclusion that the Constitution and Bill Of Rights are not applicable to the States, but merely to the central Government. Given this fact, the State of South Carolina (or any other) could easily criminalize flag burning as a felony with punishment of 5-10 in State prison, as long as there is no 1A-like provision in the State constitution. Were that the case, a County or Municipal Gov't could easily make such an act illegal. And no honest scholar of constitutional history could call such a law unconstitutional.","flag-burning","12:57 AM","government-debates","32"

I want to make a symbol of peace and I think I can only do that with a real flag. and thanks for helping wjim1269","flag-burning","01:25 PM","government-debates","33"

Baltimore), but regardless of whether it originally did or originally didn't, the priviledges and immunities clause expands the bill of rights to the states (via ""selective incorporation""). Regarding flag burning, the supreme ruled a state law banning it unconstitutional in Texas v. Johnson, and a federal law unconstitutional a year later in US v. Eichmann. They seem reasonable to me, and I am an ""honest scholar.""","flag-burning","02:47 PM","government-debates","34"

"06-05-2003","43",3,"None","None","None","John Calhoun","9061","First, for the uninitiated, a few choice exerpts from Barron v. Baltimore: ""The question thus presented is, we think, of great importance, but not of much difficulty. The Constitution was ordained and established by the people of the United States for themselves, for their own government, and not for the government of the individual States ."" *** ""If these propositions be correct, the fifth amendment must be understood as restraining the power of the General Government, not as applicable to the States."" *** ""The counsel for the plaintiff in error insists that the Constitution was intended to secure the people of the several States against the undue exercise of power by their respective State governments, as well as against that which might be attempted by their General Government. It support of this argument he relies on the inhibitions contained in the tenth section of the first article. We think that section affords a strong, if not a conclusive , argument in support of the opinion already indicated by the court. "" *** ""We are of opinion that the provision in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution declaring that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation is intended solely as a limitation on the exercise of power by the [p*251] Government of the United States, and is not applicable to the legislation of the States. "" Were this all that was said, it might well be sufficient. However, the Framers themselves were quite specific as to their view of the proper division of power between the States and the Central Government. VA Ratification, US Constitution: ""WE the Delegates of the people of Virginia, duly elected in pursuance of a recommendation from the General Assembly...DO in the name and in behalf of the people of Virginia, declare and make known that the powers granted under the Constitution, being derived from the people of the United States may be resumed by them whensoever the same shall be perverted to their injury or oppression, and that every power not granted thereby remains with them and at their will: ...and that among other essential rights, the liberty of conscience and of the press cannot be cancelled, abridged, restrained or modified by any authority of the United States."" NY Ratification, US Constitution: ""That the powers of government may be reassumed by the people whensoever it shall become necessary to their happiness; that every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by the said Constitution clearly delegated to the Congress of the United States, or the departments of the government thereof, remains to the people of the several states, or to their respective state governments, to whom they may have granted the same; and that those clauses in the said Constitution, which declare that Congress shall not have or exercise certain powers, do not imply that Congress is entitled to any powers not given by the said Constitution; but such clauses are to be construed either as exceptions to certain specified powers, or as inserted merely for greater caution."" Rhode Island ratification, US Constitution: ""III. That the powers of government may be reassumed by the people whensoever it shall become necessary to their happiness. That the rights of the states respectively to nominate and appoint all state officers, and every other power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by the said Constitution clearly delegated to the Congress of the United States, or to the departments of government thereof, remain to the people of the several states, or their respective state governments, to whom they may have granted the same; and that those clauses in the Constitution which declare that Congress shall not have or exercise certain powers, do not imply that Congress is entitled to any powers not given by the said Constitution; but such clauses are to be construed as exceptions to certain specified powers, or as inserted merely for greater caution."" South Carolina ratification, US Constitution: ""This Convention doth also declare, that no section or paragraph of the said Constitution warrants a construction that the states do not retain every power not expressly relinquished by them, and vested in the general government of the Union ."" And finally, a near-forgotten section of the United States Constitution, the 10th Amendment: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. With all this said, I see no legal, Constitutional way to criminalize flag burning BUT at the State, County, Parish (for those in the sovreign State of Louisana) or Municipal government. And providing the State constitution in question has a free speech protection, the law must be made at the County, Parish, or Municipal level. If the County or Parish ordinances have a similar Free Speech protection, then the law must fall at the municipal level. And if a municipality has a free speech provision, then there may be no restriction of flag burning in that particular municipality.","flag-burning","07:14 PM","government-debates","37"
"06-06-2003","43",3,"None","None","None","John Calhoun","9073","The regulation of free speech is specifically prohibited to the Congress and the entire of the Federal Government by the specific language of the 1st Amendment; the language is, ""Congress shall make NO law..."" and this means JUST what it says, that Congress is prohibited from proscribing any form of speech in any fashion whatever. Where, then, is the power? The power to proscribe speech must lie in the powers that delegated the Federal Government's power to it at the Constitutional Convention: the States, or the people (as organized in the Counties, Parishes and Municipalities).","flag-burning","12:25 AM","government-debates","39"

Of course the the historical facts of free speech and the constituion in a whole are important, but to me its not a matter if we are allowed to but if we should be able to. (John Calhoun) - With the various historical implications of the 1A its very possible that by law and according to law only you should not be able to. But by moral standards I think that flag burning is justifiable. Gilligan: "" i own the flag; i burn the flag. my property; my right. "" If the burning of the flag is carried out by 1. Its owner and is truly the owners property than surely he should be allowed to do w/e he wishes with it. (Of course there are alot more implications with other property such as houses in a suburban area.) anyways thats really all I have to say about this topic. But I will continue to read this thread if it doesn't involve history facts that I know nothing about Thanks for reading this Always Stay Open Minded","flag-burning","01:35 AM","government-debates","40"

It had become tattered with age and according the the rules of proper flag ettiquette when a flag is to be retired it is not to touch the ground and it is to be burnt. I burned it.
