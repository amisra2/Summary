Anyone who is under 30 years old right now is being scamed by the government. The social security contract is that the citizens pay into the system. The state will manage your money for the duration of your working career. Then when you retire the government will take care of you by returning the funds you paid into it. Textbook socialist institution, where the govenment will take responsibility of your money, then responsiblity of you when you retire. The scam is that anyone under 30, will have no funds waiting for them in the system 30 years form now. Due to the demograpics, the baby boomers are eating up all the social security funds. Those of us under 30 will not have enough younger workers around to support us, they way we support the baby boomers.","social-security-socialist-scam","02:24 PM","government-debates","1"
"02-15-2003","226",1,"None","None","None","fallingupwards","2180","the only reason why the younger generations may not receive social security benefits is because republicans like George W keep cutting taxes. for some odd reason, republicans LOVE deficits and hate surpluses. dont ask me why. we had a surplus every year from 1998 to 2000 and then all of a sudden our friendly president george decides to enact a multi-trillion dollar tax-cut and we are in a deficit. way to go george. there went our surplus. i'm sure every old person from the time of FDR to the present was very pleased to receive their social security check when they turned 66 years old. if we dont continue running on a deficit, then our generation will receive a check too. and who knows, you might really really NEED it. many old people use it to help pay for their prescriptions. its easy to condemn social security when you're young, but just you wait until retirement age. if people continue to vote republican and we continue to have a budget deficit, then hopefully when we reach retirement age, the younger generation will pay for the checks that we receive. our generation is not nearly as large as the baby boomers either.","social-security-socialist-scam","02:55 PM","government-debates","2"

That is in effect what your propose. Example: (knock knock) Hello my name is Falling. I am here to help the poor. I am here to take your money. At this point I start shooting and call 911 to arrest a thief. VS. (knock knock) Hello my name is Falling. I am here to help the poor. Can you help me? At this point I decide if I want to. If I decide the cause is worthy I do.","social-security-socialist-scam","03:11 PM","government-debates","4"

"02-15-2003","226",1,"None","None","None","kelvin90701","2206","Social security has been in trouble before GW was in office. This problem cuts across political parties. If social security left me alone, I would do a better job of taking care of my own retirement. In any case it is a broken institution. It is floundering now, in a few more years in will be completely dead broke. How do you fix it? You can't. It has become a 2000 lb gorilla with a mind of it's own. Perfect example of what happens when government gets big. Give the government a little bit of authority and they don't give it back.","social-security-socialist-scam","04:52 PM","government-debates","6"
"02-15-2003","226",1,"None","None","None","fallingupwards","2208","republicans have been spending money that has been reserved for social security for decades. dont you remember the 2000 election? al gore said he wanted to keep social security in a ""lockbox"" and not touch it. democrats want to leave the money alone, republicans want to spend it and give out tax cuts. common sense tells us that if you cut taxes AND spend money, there will be a deficit. why do republicans like deficits??? the next thing i say might be stretching it a little, but maybe its not too far off. i would not be surprised if republicans and conservatives WANT social security to be a failure. yes, you heard me right...they WANT it to fail. why? because if it works, then that is a score for big government. republicans spend money and make huge tax cuts in order to run a budget deficit. you cannot have your cake and eat it too. republicans seem to think you can. they live in a fantasy world. even alan greenspan knows what the republicans are doing. i never would have guessed in a million years that greenspan would agree with the democrats. but he does now!! george w proposed another multi-trillion tax cut, despite the fact that we have a budget deficit!! greenspan said that this is a HUGE mistake and that cutting taxes during a deficit will take even more money from social security. i used to not like greenspan, but i respect him now. he is not blind to what the republicans are trying to do. he knows that huge tax cuts will increase the deficit and will take away from social security.","social-security-socialist-scam","05:05 PM","government-debates","7"
"02-15-2003","226",1,"None","None","None","Broker","2234","Hold it right there, Falling! We Republicans, with our huge taxes, have this habit of doubling Federal revenues. JFK was not a Republican, but he and Reagan had the right idea, and I think George does too. I think our governemnt should not ahvea surplus. If it does, too much of our money is being taken. Social security is already a huge mess, and in California alone they are losing BILLIONS to fraud. It is time to reform our systems. This is why I like private investment accounts...","social-security-socialist-scam","07:57 PM","government-debates","8"

We are in wartime and just made a huge government shuffle. Now is the time to expect deficits...

I have enough money, but give me more. I do belive the GW tax cut is a farce. Not because it is a tax cut, but because it a tax cut on capital gains. Who made any real gains this year on the stock market? GW is flambozling tax payers, by make it sound like he really is helping people. I am willing to accept the idea that a tax cut at this moment is not a great idea, but if the government has enough it should not take anymore. Greenspan? That is a Regan appointee......

"11-27-2003","226",1,"None","None","None","witzelcheck","24345","Back to Social Security. First of all, there is no money in the fund, due to some leaders' 'brilliant' plan to use it to balance the deficit. Second, at the rate of the aging population, SS is in for a bumpy ride. Right now, 6-7 people support 1 retired person with SS. In about 20 years (don't remember exact #) it will be about 2 people for every retired person. Now that's going to be a big chunk of that pay check. And we won't even benifit for the $$ we're paying. Also, with SS, our generation (speaking for 14-24 year olds here) will be paying for the baby boomers. They, quite frankly, are a rather spoiled lot, if you don't mind me saying so. We'll be paying for everything. How are we going to support or families? More government $$? Where exactly is it going to come from?","social-security-socialist-scam","09:29 PM","government-debates","14"

In the end, stocks always go up... usually by large margins. Even in some go sour... automatic sell orders, etc. The old system should still always be an option though. You make good money when they're taking 30%... I would say they do have the right. That'd be over $150,000 income at least...","social-security-socialist-scam","11:09 AM","government-debates","16"
