Times have changed since then. Adapt to modern times and move on. Illegal mexicans are contributing nothing to the country. They take their wages and send them back to Mexico. They're stealing from this country.","sinjin","299477","Modern times for our country will include a substantial Latino influence. Can you adapt? You must not eat many vegetables to believe they contribute nothing. Moreover, they contribute the lions share of all physical labor being done in the U.S. Theives generally aren't paid wages. Btw, you think they're the only ones sending their earnings ""offshore""?","immigration","12:52 PM","government-debates","16"

We already told them twice that we want no part of amnesty programs for illegal immigrants, we're gonna keep telling them until they drop the bill permanently.","immigration","12:58 PM","government-debates","17"

Yes - they absolutely should come over legally. But we need to fix the legal immigration process. I went through it with my ex-husband and its awful. These people are faced with rude, unhelpful, immigration people - not to mention dishonesty and outright lies. That said (most) illegal immigrants aren't vile criminals - they are simply poor. In a way the majority of America can hardly imagine. If your baby were hungry and the ability to feed it was just accross the river - trying to do that hardly makes you a monster. I would do it. I would do anything I had to for my son. For Americans , the majority of whom have a standard of living signfigantly higher than much of the rest of the world, to demonize these people is utterly pathetic. We also need to practice what we preach when it comes to being legal outside of our borders. There are a plethera of US owned companies operating in Mexico that blatantly break US and Mexican labor and environmental laws. One example is that they were ordered in the Reagon years to ship their waste back here - most don't, they dump it in the Rio Grande. The US doesn't have any moral high ground when it comes US/Mexican relations. We treat them like ####.","immigration","03:59 PM","government-debates","19"
