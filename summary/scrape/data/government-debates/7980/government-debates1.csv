The strategy, Chertoff said, includes aggressive criminal prosecution against ""bad actors"" who knowingly and consistently hire illegal aliens, as well as a crackdown against widespread misuse of Social Security numbers.~ Who's going to pay for this expanded federal police force and the associated costs they incur (Chertoff also manages the TSA federal airport cops)? Our criminal justice system is so overloaded plea bargaining is the norm in all but capital or headline crimes. We have the highest per-capita incarceration rate of any developed country, more jails? We're peddling debt using military threat just to keep the doors open, even more on the credit card for, what? More reason for any US manufacturing company with a shred of common sense to move offshore, expanding our service economy at an even faster rate.","immigration","08:32 PM","government-debates","1"

So to suck it up, guess who will...legal citizens of the U.S. Our government needs to follow through on their own laws, instead, they send a mixed message and give them money, give them housing, give them medical, give them schooling. Our government has shown that they lack experience and dedication in enforcing the laws we've created. Illegal immigrants are people just like you and I, we are all the same in equality as human beings, no one is disputing that but at some point ""america"" is going to break, the influx of people and jobs (life-sustaining- beyond-poverty-job) not increasing at the same rate, it truly is a disaster in the making. ""They"" say there are 12 million illegals here, well, personally I think its more than that but whatever, in the next 10 years, I think the true number will double and double again 10 years after that, the majority of illegals are of mexican and south american heritage, by 2050 America's domiant race will be hispanic and this will be a spanish speaking country. Is this good or bad? Well, in reality its neither. Look back on history. The Americas have had numerous owners, of various descents some gained by trade, some by wars. What the new ""occupants"" are doing is quiete interesting I think, they come in peace and they come by the millions, and ""we"" let them stay. The landscape of US will dramatically change, but it's really never about people, but the economics of that country that will decide that fate of that country. The US will become a third-world country, not because of the people but the economics by 2050 I do predict. Mexico and South America is geographically located in climate-friendly locations the land is invaluable, but people from these countries come in droves to the US not really wanting to leave a ""beautiful"" country, but to leave their country to find JOBS, to live life out of poverty. To live a better life for them and their family. What's the solution for the US? Two roads to take. Create laws and ENFORCE THEM, and prosecute those who harbor and employ illegals. Illegals will not remain if they can't feed themselve,house themselves, clothe themselves. For those illegals who then commit crimes, we need to take a hard line and make them do hard time, 5 years, 10 years and not in a comfy prison, that's another problem we have here. Or The other road we can take and seem to be going that route. Turn a blind eye and act as if the fate of america isn't at stake. Let US citizens pay for non-US citizens. Let good jobs be devalued with poverty paying wages with no benefits, let America, be a culture of two; Rich or Poor, let america have many cultures not assimilating. America is a large country, and frankly the amount of people legal or not living in the US as of today can sustain with the economy we do have now. However, 25 years from now...??? I'll be around in 25 years from now, I'm just sitting back and waiting, to see how it all pans out. It will be very interesting that is for sure.","immigration","05:54 PM","government-debates","2"

Who's going to pay for the new federal police force and associated costs? More deficit spending or further reductions of revenue sharing with states forcing additional tax increases at state and municipal levels? Property and sales taxes will only bear a finite percentage of taxation before defaults and reduced transaction levels become common.","immigration","07:30 PM","government-debates","3"

What we need idealy is to change the penalty structure so there are steeper fines for the company, not just the individuals. I would imagine this will be fairly effective. They do not have to atually task a large number of agents to this, merely make afew high profile busts each year. Similar to IRS enforcement, it is more a quesiton of implied threat than actual threat (looking at the number of audits performed each year as a percentage of taxpayers, audtis are virtually non existant). I actually support this. If we are going to generate some kind of worker program in order to get these people on the tax roles, then so be it. If not, then we need to kick their butts back across the border.","immigration","07:43 PM","government-debates","4"

Bye-bye even more tax base. The majority of jobs taken by illegal immigrants are not with large companies but small operations on thin margins and individuals who employ personal help. I can't see how intimidation would have any effect on them unless compliance was expanded to where enforcement, the judicial system and incarceration grows to where it becomes additional government overhead with negligible offsetting revenue from fines. We know we can't seal the borders, our growing two-tier system demands cheap labor (though the general public still hasn't caught on to that), no politician is capable of fixing our welfare or retirement systems because that's how they buy votes and we really can't afford a new federal police force with associated costs and deportation burden. We need an economic depression or guest worker program.","immigration","08:22 PM","government-debates","5"

(1) mikehuckabee.com (2) CNN also from personal experience from many summer jobs, many companies use cheap labor for a higher personal gain which does not effect on the price of their product or service.","immigration","12:21 AM","government-debates","8"

I'll help them do it...legally. What is disgusting is the thumbing of their noses and those of their leaders at the laws of the US. Unless you live in a community that's been devastated by an influx of illegals, their crimes, their drain on a tax supported social and medical benefit system, you cannot really appreciate the damage that these illegal people are illegally forcing on the law abiding citizens of various communities. You are accepting them from a distance because it doesn't get directly in your pocket or affect your personal life much. Sure, I feel compassion for them. I feel compassion for their victims also. I've heard that 9000 per year in the United States die at the hands of illegal aliens. Maybe some of those dieing were illegal aliens themselves, but the fact remain that 9000 people die in the US at the hands of people who should not be be here anyway. Ask the women who've been raped by an illegal alien what they think about compassion for the rapist.","immigration","04:54 PM","government-debates","11"
