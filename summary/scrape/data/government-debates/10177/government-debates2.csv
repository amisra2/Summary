Accuse elderly germans of ""anti-germanism"", ditto for italians, or start chatting about ""anti-sovietism"" in an eastern european old peoples home. See what kinds of reactions you get. If you are interested in a scholarly analysis of nationalism and patriotism as cultural phenomenon, and in particular how they developed, Benedict Anderson's Imagined Communities is brilliant.","what-patriotism","10:39 PM","government-debates","17"

Fortunately most aren't stupid enough to go down this road.","unkerpaulie","288493","actually reality suggests that a significant number of people do go down this road. thats exactly what liminus is pointing out. if the country is at war with another country, you would be immediately and unanimously labelled unpatriotic if you had ANY feelings other than hatred for that country. the label also extends to anybody who doesnt fully worship all american leaders, policies, historical figures and inanimate objects that represent abstract aspects of america","what-patriotism","02:27 PM","government-debates","19"

Take, for instance, growing number of extradition requests from only Poland for criminals, who are suspected of such serious crimes in their native country, as murder, rape, robbery, burglary or drugs. In the last 12 months, officers from our Metropolitan Polices Extradition Unit have been asked to track down 257 Poles across the UK (dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=504532&in_page_id=181 1). All of them have found shelter with this country. Why did they prefer Great Britain, not Spain or Germany? And what about those terrorist leaders, who lost their citizenship long ago and, by this time, have turned into international killers? Look, for example, at Y. Ahmadov, whose name has recently come to light in connection with discovered attempt on life of B. Patarkatsishvili, a Georgian tycoon, who decided to suggest himself for Georgian president now (htt://timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/acticle3087485.ece). It is understatement to say that this Chechen mercenary has prepared realization of his bloody plans on the territory of this country. Our special services have been unable to prevent his appearance in the state, whose citizens he headhunted in far Chechnya just in the 90-s years! Thus, one can arrive at a conclusion that our SIS officers may even have some contacts with such cutthroats as Mr. Ahmadov, using them for solving certain own problems. For crying out loud! How much should British people exercise patience towards regular bandits like Y. Ahmadov, whose hands are stained with blood of 4 of our country fellows? Well, our authorities grant them political asylum only because our special services are not qualified enough for maintenance of own countrys security","what-patriotism","08:40 AM","government-debates","24"
