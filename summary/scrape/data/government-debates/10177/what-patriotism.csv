I ask this question mainly for the americans on this forum, mainly because in the UK patriotism isn't really the flashpoint issue that it seems to be in the states. This could be because people overreact to the idea of patriotism because they associate it with Nazi Germany, and also because Britain has already had its decline and fall (to an extent) so we are not so wrapped up in notions of being a 'great' country. I also ask with reference to the oft-repeated accusations of someone being 'un-american' or 'anti-american'. This is definitely not something you ever see in the UK; never in my life have I heard or read someone using the phrase 'anti-British'. I am hard pressed, in fact, to recall a single instance of any culture outside the US using this turn of phrase, with the exception of supranational religion ('un-christian', 'anti-muslim' etc). It seems to me to be a meaningless label, particularly (and ironically) so for the 'land of the free' where evryone is supposed to be able to pursue their own crazy lifestyle and espouse their own crazy views without this sort of vilification. An extension of this is people being told that they obviously 'hate their own country' etc, with the tacet implication that they are supposed to absolutely love it, a form of flag-worship in my opinion. This makes no sense to me, because as a UK citizen I neither love nor hate my 'country' as a whole. How can I? There are aspects of British life that I love, such as our cynical attitude and irreverent sense of humour, and there are aspects that I hate, such as our readiness to follow the US into wars, and our woefully one-dimensional politics. So what do think patriotism is? How do you define a patriot? What (if anything) does it mean to be 'anti-american'?","what-patriotism","05:32 PM","government-debates","1"

How can I?","James","276099","There is a distinction between patriotism and nationalism - which I think you've tended to obscure in your reference to Nazi Germany by comparison with Britain. Patriotism is a sentiment of attachment - i.e. love of one's country; while nationalism is associated with an ideology of national superiority. Another contrast is between a respect for political institutions and laws (patriotism), and a belligerent devotion to race, language, and custom (nationalism). Doesn't any vilification arise from confusing the difference between between patriot and nationalist? To answer this question, you might need to ask another: would you be prepared to fight and even die in defence of your country? An affirmative answer might go some way towards defining what patriotism is. James.","what-patriotism","11:31 AM","government-debates","2"

Attachment to a particular state is absurd as they are artificial constructs, look at the spread of celts across the western end of europe, celtic cultures survive in 6 countries, only one of which is an independent state. In any case, even if all states were nation states, it would still ignore the fundamental commonality of experience between people of the same class in different countries. The concerns of factory workers in Britain and Germany are likely to be closer to each other than they are to the concerns of, say, lawyers in either country.","what-patriotism","05:51 PM","government-debates","4"
"08-07-2007","10177",1,"Liminus","276730","This is partly because I think we are very aware that the concept of 'British values' is meaningless, because people from different subcultures, different class, different regions have conflicting values, at least those that go beyond basic human ones. Absolutely not. I would fight and die in defence of my family, but if (a big if, in the UK) we were invaded I would try to get my family together and bugger off to Canada, or wherever. If that proved impossible, then I would fight the invasion, but only for the sake of my family.","James","276839","I agree that the economic and cultural concerns of the ""average"" working man are hardly identical to the director in the boardroom. But there is a core of values that I believe most British people would say is meaningful to them. In the event of a foreign invasion, defence of one's family can hardly be separated from defence of the nation. If the country goes under, what will become of the individual's family? You might justify your willingness to fight an enemy on the grounds that you're only interested in the welfare of your family. This is what, I imagine, many soldiers have said (to themselves) when they've been called up. But personal motives hardly matter in the ""big picture"" which materialises when the country is at war.

The fact remains that throughout most of history until the 20th century, the lives of individuals were only minimally affected by invasion. Do you really think the life of the average serf changed drastically when William invaded England?","what-patriotism","09:25 AM","government-debates","6"

The suffering and destruction was immense - even with the limited weapons available at that time. On the general idea of patriotism - which predictably you wish to discredit - it ought to be remembered (to paraphrase Orwell) that as you sleep safely in your bed dreaming your liberal dreams, rough men must stand ready to do violence on your behalf.

"08-07-2007","10177",1,"None","None","None","Phunting","276897","Heh. I notice despite the thread being aimed at Yanks, everyone who has answered is British! Personally I consider myself a patriot. I love my country, I want it to do well, and I generally support it. The same can be said of my Rugby team, and I think the two equate. I know that my team is not inherently superior to any other (far from it with our current position ) but I still enjoy belonging to them, and having them belong to me. I think this is a natural human response, and patriotism in such a form is harmless and probably healthy. The problem is when patriots, and sports fans, actually begin to believe their own words and hate other countries/ clubs because of their blind adherence. Fortunately most aren't stupid enough to go down this road.","what-patriotism","01:03 PM","government-debates","8"

If you do not see a distinction between the two, then it would seem you agree with the nationalists, that the way for one nation to prosper is to harm others, eg by going to war for resources, by blocking their exports from entering your country. The classical liberals were certainly patriots, but they believed that the road to prosperity was built on peace and trade with other nations. Their opponents were the nationalists. Nationalism prospers precisely because of this false belief, that to prosper you must do harm, and though you may consider yourself anti-nationalist, if you propagate this falsity, you will fuel nationalism.

Take, for instance, growing number of extradition requests from only Poland for criminals, who are suspected of such serious crimes in their native country, as murder, rape, robbery, burglary or drugs. In the last 12 months, officers from our Metropolitan Polices Extradition Unit have been asked to track down 257 Poles across the UK (dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=504532&in_page_id=181 1). All of them have found shelter with this country. Why did they prefer Great Britain, not Spain or Germany? And what about those terrorist leaders, who lost their citizenship long ago and, by this time, have turned into international killers? Look, for example, at Y. Ahmadov, whose name has recently come to light in connection with discovered attempt on life of B. Patarkatsishvili, a Georgian tycoon, who decided to suggest himself for Georgian president now (htt://timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/acticle3087485.ece). It is understatement to say that this Chechen mercenary has prepared realization of his bloody plans on the territory of this country. Our special services have been unable to prevent his appearance in the state, whose citizens he headhunted in far Chechnya just in the 90-s years! Thus, one can arrive at a conclusion that our SIS officers may even have some contacts with such cutthroats as Mr. Ahmadov, using them for solving certain own problems. For crying out loud! How much should British people exercise patience towards regular bandits like Y. Ahmadov, whose hands are stained with blood of 4 of our country fellows?
