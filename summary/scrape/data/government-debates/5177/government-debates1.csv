We don't know what the future might bring, the United States hegemony could be ended by ""imperial overstretch"", European ambitions may fail in the face of divisions and economic weakness; China's economic steamroller could could fulfil it's ambitions or it could falter. We could be living in a world without power, when all international order breaks down, or we could be living in a world dominated by a China whose values may be distinctly against those we aspire to. Who knows what other factors might come into play. Would it not be prudent, to re-establish world order or to challenge China's dominance, to form a new federal entity recognising the common heritage and values of western civilisation? To act united in strength where we could not divided in weakness?","united-states-north-atlantic","05:51 AM","government-debates","1"

What I am talking about in terms of ""re-establishing world order"" is if a situation were to arise where there was a power vacuum in the world, leading to an (more) anarchic interntional order (like in the dark ages), would it be prudent to create a new western power block to be the new ""world police"".","united-states-north-atlantic","09:52 AM","government-debates","3"

Wouldn't this political unity between the US and Europe, if it came about and was used for the purpose you suggest, amount to a kind of neo-imperialism ? So are we going to examine that possibility in the light of other (more limited) imperialisms which have been ""discredited"" ? It's theoretical, but worth discussing.","united-states-north-atlantic","10:23 AM","government-debates","6"

I simply meant ""do what dominant powers do"" in the realist sense. ""Policing"" the world in the defence of and furthurence of ones interests, whatever they may be. No more than the current European project does. EDIT: If you believe the current US dominance to be an ""Empire"" then that is the case. That depends on your definition of imperialism.

This would probably include economic and financial exploitation by the imperial power. To challenge, say, China with such naked aggression, in the defence and furtherance of western interests, might escalate in no time to a nuclear confrontation. Your suggestion that the current European project is a kind of imperialism (by subterfuge ?) is one that I haven't come across before. Haven't all the member states joined the union as volunteers ? Or do you think the EU has an imperial policy in the sense that I decribed above ?","united-states-north-atlantic","10:55 AM","government-debates","8"

What I do find more plausible is more political and economical co-operation between EU and the US, quite possible in the form of an economic alliance and in a resurection and reinvention of NATO. Allthough I think this would only be possible if the US ""fell from grace"" so to speak. As long as america is percieved (by others and themselves) as the most dominant and important region in the world, I think competition will be as important as co-operation.","united-states-north-atlantic","06:26 AM","government-debates","12"

How long it takes to overcome individual and national emotion of sharply defined identity retention will define the degree of success the union achieves. The US industrial decline, based on circumstances identical to those in mature European countries, is being presented to the US public as a temporary circumstance using internal transactions and debt to keep an illusion of economic growth in place for political purposes. Unfortunately, as you point out, this position and aggressive foreign policy has created a sense of US isolation, placing (in paranoid US eyes) the fledgling EU in a position of competitor, not future trading partner. I'm in partial agreement with your opinion that it will require a dramatic change in US attitude and policy to forge any sort of alliance between the US and EU, but my feeling is the change will be due to US economic, not political, necessity. And that will require an abrupt, tragic using your word, change in the US standard of living. IMO the major economic factor of achieving any workable alliance between the EU and US will be keyed by China's ability and timing to expand their per- capita income to develop that vast domestic market. With the majority of their capital investment coming from outside China yet remaining under Chinese control, if China reaches that point of adequate per-capita income, exports will be required only to service natural resource trade requirements, not provide value added wealth for infrastructure purposes. At that point, any Western alliance will be second best for a long, long time.","united-states-north-atlantic","10:06 AM","government-debates","14"
