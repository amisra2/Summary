What's this stuff about faith based initiatives? Isn't that just another way to circumvent the separation of church and state? What about all these religious leaders praising one party over another and pushing for their followers to vote for this candidate or that candidate? I don't think it should be allowed. What about the oath the newly elected president takes to ""uphold and defend the constitution of the United States""? Ignoring, attempting to ammend it, or working around it seems to be common these days. People get mad when prayer was taken out of schools. What if you were a Christian and the Government said you must say ""in the name of Alla's name we pray"" would you still want prayer in school?

"07-23-2004","2799",1,"None","None","None","Anastasia","59549","I think that separation of church and state is often misunderstood. It really means Freedom FROM religion.... Freedom from religion does not mean, as some might mistakenly believe, being free from seeing religion in society. No one has the right not to see churches, religious expression, and other examples of religious belief in our nation. What freedom from religion does mean, however, is the freedom from the rules and dogmas of other people's religious beliefs so that we can be free to follow the demands of our own conscience, whether they take a religious form or not. If it were to be really separate, wouldn't our money not have ""In GOD we trust"" etc etc... Plus a lot of people do not realize that the majority of people voting are religious and that will show in who gets elected... May not seem fair but it certainly is there...","i-think-constitutional-separation-church-state-should-upheld","05:52 PM","government-debates","2"

You mean that the last around 50 years of government interperetation of the constition is a ""common misconception."" ? Terral's reply >> While GreatMoose used this phrase, please allow me to offer a reply. While congress has not supported the establishment of any religion, our forefathers saw fit to have a moment of silent prayer, after our Pledge of Allegiance. I remember this moment of silent prayer growing up in the public school system. GreatMoose appears to be acknowledging the fact that a judicial order to remove prayer from the equation is a violation of someones First Amendment rights. After all, congress has no right to create a law that prohibits the free exercise of religion. Are we clear on that aspect? So no judicial order restricting public prayer can possibly be based upon the accurate interpretation of our Constitutional Rights guaranteed under the First Amendment. If my take on this is correct, then he is also not offering any support or constitutional evidence for adding school prayer as being legal either. However, since the tradition was established before most of us were born, then removing the practice by court order is a violation of our civil rights. Therefore, this being true, his view is that there has been a lot of misinterpretation going on. Shocked >> 2. You seem to stress that professing Christians are the majority, and are therefore allowed to impose their beliefs on everyone else? That's one of the most un-american things I've heard this year. Terrals reply >> I wish your statement included evidence where this has taken place. I am just as willing to fight for your right to believe in nothing. Even with the moment of silent prayer in place, who forced any religion on any of your kids? If you are threatened by the children of professing Christians taking a moment for a public expression of their faith, then perhaps your belief system requires some updating, or something a bit more substantial, or something. I am sorry, but the public school environment is a microcosm of our society. Sooner or later they are likely to actually see another person praying, even if they never do at home. Take away prayer and give them all condoms: thats the ticket. Shocked >> A democrocay (last I checked this is what America is) does indeed have majority rule, but we also have...minority rights.

Terrals reply >> This is the straw man of many atheists seeking to prohibit the free expression of religion in this country. Government has no place in establishing or prohibiting the free exercise of religion . . . PERIOD. Prayer in public schools has been going on since before I was born.

But no matter, Ill respond to that point in this post. Concerning the links you provided: It seems the judge was removed from office for refusing to obey a court order, and not for actually installing the Ten Commandments statue. That is a subtle difference, yes, but a fairly important one. His superiors (you could say the Moores boss) decided his view on a matter was incorrect. Judge Moore is not the supreme judge of the land the buck does not stop with him. But then again maybe youre arguing that the federal government should not meddle in the affairs of how a state government should run its state. In that case I would agree with you, I think the federal government should get out of the business of decided how states should run their state (making the Federal Marriage Amendment bogus but thats neither here nor there). However (you knew it was coming) if a state government passes a law, or performs an action that undermines the federal constitution, then the action or law is not permissible. If a state constitution allowed for a ban on gun ownership, and a law was passed putting into effect a ban on gun ownership, the federal government would have the power to step in and overrule the ban. In this case the district judge found the monument to be unconstitutional, and so it was in his power to tell Moore what to do. If you want to continue the idea that there the government actually can pass laws that support religions, or subtly support one religion over another, then fine. Well discuss that. But digest the above first. Since he was acting as a government official, in the setting of a government building, his actions represent government policy. He is free to erect a statue of the Ten Commandments on his front porch if he feels like it. In the same way any individual can be as much of a bigot as they please. However when acting as a government representative, they are not entitled to express those views. A private store owner can refuse service to a black patron simply because they are black but to deny justice to someone because of their skin color is unconstitutional. And in the same way that Moore didnt actually pass any laws, discriminating against black people in a court room is not actually passing a law but this still makes it a violation of the constitution. Hmm I guess Ill have to explicitly state my beliefs in their entirety before I can expect you to make a fairly simple logical step. I would not support any kind of government action to modify any kind of symbol from the private sector. So I dont want to remove Gods name and religious symbols from everything in America. I just want to remove them from government agencies that explicitly state they will not have such symbols. As you may or may not have noticed above (about Moore and the ten commandments) I didnt say one way or the other whether I thought what he did was right or wrong, or even if the ten commandments should be there. I just said that the federal government had jurisdiction, and they acted on it. As far as the term God in the pledge, I dont know about your state, but I feel that my state (California) is pretty clear on weather something of that nature should be allowed. [quote = Terral] Our forefathers before us placed them there as an exercise of their freedom of religion. [/quote] in the same way that the founding fathers never mentioned God in the governments governing document, or on printed currency, or in the pledge? No, you must mean a different group of forefathers perhaps maybe the forefathers from the cold war who wanted to stick it to the godless pinko commie atheists by putting God on our money and into the pledge. as a side note, when examining the ten commandments not even half of them are actually expressed in US law. 1) No Gods before me: First amendment prohibits this kind of law. 2) No graven images: Not as explicitly forbidden as commandment 1, however this kind of law would probably never be passed as infringes on practice of religion. 3) No taking Gods name in vain: First amendment also prohibits this kind of law. 4) No breaking of the Sabbath: again, no laws regarding what to do on any given day, and congress would be hard pressed to pass such a law. 5) No dishonoring parents: While is socially encouraged, there is no explicit law. Parents have legal jurisdiction over their children, but this says nothing about the childrens obligations to their parents. 6) No Murder: Ta-da, this is in fact illegal 7) No adultery: Not too sure about this one. Im guessing there are not many laws prohibiting sleeping around however I am fairly confident such laws are not enforced much. At any rate, to be on the safe side Ill say government law does express this. 8) No stealing: Yup, there are legal repercussions if we steal. 9) No Perjury: well, there is no law against lying in generalhowever it is a crime to lie and break contracts. Ok Ill give up this one to. So thats 4 so far. 10) No coveting: Im pretty sure I dont know exactly what covet means in this context but if it means desire, or to want then there is no law against desiring or wanting something. So of the 4 (3.5) commandments that are actually expressed in our laws, did they really have to come from the Ten Commandments? Stealing, murdering, and lying are pretty much required for any productive society, and they have definitely been independently developed in religions and societies that didnt have access to the Ten Commandments. gasp, gay people are demanding equal rights? Well if they are entitled to those rights as humans, what is the problem? As for atheists, please find me an atheist who wants you to remove references to God in your private house and then maybe Ill consider your assertion that any single person wants to remove God from everything. You do realize that government buildings and organizations are very different from the individuals that the constitution provided for right? Including giving harsher sentences to homosexuals because their behavior is an abomination? Or awarding custody to the father (aka leader of the household) over the mother for no reason at all? As a representative of the government, their first and foremost responsibility is to uphold the ideals of the constitution and the government of the United States. In this case their religion does not come first, and their religion can not come first. When there is a conflict between the two ideals, the constitution will win. In your world it would be somehow tragic if the government represented a religious view that was different form yours however when other are subjected to the same situation its just an unfortunate circumstance. I am not fighting for an atheistic country, but rather a religiously neutral country. When given the choice between God, No God and silence, I choose for the government to be silent.

You mean that the last around 50 years of government interperetation of the constition is a ""common misconception."" ? Terral's reply >> While GreatMoose used this phrase, please allow me to offer a reply. While congress has not supported the establishment of any religion, our forefathers saw fit to have a moment of silent prayer, after our Pledge of Allegiance. I remember this moment of silent prayer growing up in the public school system. GreatMoose appears to be acknowledging the fact that a judicial order to remove prayer from the equation is a violation of someones First Amendment rights. After all, congress has no right to create a law that prohibits the free exercise of religion. Are we clear on that aspect? So no judicial order restricting public prayer can possibly be based upon the accurate interpretation of our Constitutional Rights guaranteed under the First Amendment. If my take on this is correct, then he is also not offering any support or constitutional evidence for adding school prayer as being legal either. However, since the tradition was established before most of us were born, then removing the practice by court order is a violation of our civil rights. Therefore, this being true, his view is that there has been a lot of misinterpretation going on. Shocked >> 2. You seem to stress that professing Christians are the majority, and are therefore allowed to impose their beliefs on everyone else? That's one of the most un-american things I've heard this year. Terrals reply >> I wish your statement included evidence where this has taken place. I am just as willing to fight for your right to believe in nothing. Even with the moment of silent prayer in place, who forced any religion on any of your kids? If you are threatened by the children of professing Christians taking a moment for a public expression of their faith, then perhaps your belief system requires some updating, or something a bit more substantial, or something. I am sorry, but the public school environment is a microcosm of our society. Sooner or later they are likely to actually see another person praying, even if they never do at home. Take away prayer and give them all condoms: thats the ticket. Shocked >> A democrocay (last I checked this is what America is) does indeed have majority rule, but we also have...minority rights. I hope everyone understands the two pillars this ""great nation"" was founded on. At least that's what I was taught, and have since come to admire and understand. Terrals reply >> Actually, this is also a big misconception. Do you remember the Pledge? Was our allegiance to the democracy for which it stands? We live in a republic under laws, and not in a democracy under people. Shocked >> 3. What exactly are ""Christians"" like yourself, not allowed to do? You can pray anywhere you like, you just can't force goverment sponsored institutions to promote your religion...ANY religion. Terrals reply >> This is the straw man of many atheists seeking to prohibit the free expression of religion in this country. Government has no place in establishing or prohibiting the free exercise of religion . . . PERIOD. Prayer in public schools has been going on since before I was born. Enacting change through any act of congress or judge is absolutely illegal, according to the law. And yet, we are currently watching all references to God, the cross, Ten Commandments, etc. being systematically removed from public places. Shocked >> You can pray in school, you know that, right? You just can't force other kids to. You think this is wrong? Please tell me it's all just a big misunderstanding. Terrals reply >> These above mentioned historical and religious artifacts are being erased and blotted out in violation of the First Amendment. You have no problem with the systematic erosion of personal freedoms in this country? How about when they begin aggressively destroying our personal liberties guaranteed under the Second Amendment, and our right to bear arms? No sir. Far too many Americans have given their lives for the establishment and preservation of our personal liberties for us to sit by and watch them being trampled on in this way. Removing all traces of God from public places is not an option. The atheists are going to keep pushing, until one day the go a bit too far; if they have not gone too far already. God bless, Terral","Mach","60176","That's a lot of writing for my quick three sentences! 1. Tradition or ""being done this way before you were born"", has nothing to do with something being constitutional or unconstitutional. Sorry. And yes, an example is slavery. While I'm sure some son of a son of a slave owner would love his field-hands and house servants back under his yoke, it's now, illegal, and unconstitutional. So yes, it doesn't work the way you'd like it to work. Some people call it progress. 2. Our country being founded on majority rule and minority rights is not a misconception. Type those words into google and let me know what you find, it will be obvious that I didn't dream up what our government is about. 3. This is the crux of our argument, seriously, this will save you some headaches down the road if you just walk with me here. - You can pray in school, or anywhere you feel like it. - The government should not pass laws or keep laws on the books that respect or establish any religion. - Therefore, the government cannot make or uphold a law that requires government (tax payer funded) institutions to respect any religion, which schools are a part of. They cannot make a law that REQUIRES people to pray or respects ""Prayer time"", or any other religious buzz word things. So, there is no ambiguity there. You can pray in school, it just cannot be MANDATED by the school. I.e. the government cannot tell anyone they need to pray, or worship, or pause and reflect on a higher power. However, you can do these things on your own volition. You see, that's why the law is good, and your desire to see Christianity spread by our government = bad. 4. Last I checked we had three branches of government, and indeed, you're wrong, judges and congress have a great deal to do with what's legal and what's not. The suprement court's rulings are..supreme, and congress certainly does work hard to get bills turned into laws. So yes, they can make bills that do, well, most anything, and some even become laws. There are checks and balances in place, but yeah, that's their job and stuff. 5. The ACLU fights for everyone's civil liberties, and they often team up with the Christian Coalition if some religious people or groups get their rights trampled on. They take a lot of negative press for some reason from the religious right...not sure why. Maybe it's because their goal is to fight the ""systematic erosion of our personal freedoms"". That's just an FYI. No, I don't stand by, by the way. 6. Religion in public places = places paid for by tax payer dollars = government supporting that religion = violation of establishment clause = bad. That's just a reiteration of #3. 7. The alabama judge you mention is a criminal, and was treated like one. He was in the wrong, in so many ways. And he was taken care of. You don't decide you ""don't like the law"" and just go breaking them. That's called..anarchy, or criminal, or breaking the law..you know the routine.

"07-31-2004","2799",3,"None","None","None","terral03","60505","Greetings Morph: Thank you for the very good post explaining your well thought out viewpoints. Morph >> Concerning the links you provided: It seems the judge was removed from office for refusing to obey a court order, and not for actually installing the Ten Commandments statue. That is a subtle difference, yes, but a fairly important one. Terrals reply >> I do believe that the Alabama judge did indeed place the monument. U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson ruled Monday that the monument INSTALLED BY THE CHIEF JUSTICE goes too far in promoting religion and ordered it removed within 30 days. The federal judge handed down a judgment that was based upon the interpretation (or misinterpretation) of some law. The article goes on to say, Opponents of the monument argued that it promoted the judge's conservative Christian faith in violation of the Constitution's ban on government establishment of religion. Here is where the misinterpretation aspects begin to play out. Judge Moore did not seek to establish any religion. Our First Amendment forbids congress from making laws. Therefore, nothing in the First Amendment applies to this case at all. If the Federal Judge wishes to pass down a legal judgment, then it must not be based upon his or her personal opinions, but it must be supported by some aspect of the law. So which law did Judge Moore break? Morph >> His superiors (you could say the Moores boss) decided his view on a matter was incorrect. Judge Moore is not the supreme judge of the land the buck does not stop with him. Terrals reply >> Are you saying that the Federal Judge is the superior of the State Judge? And, are you basing that on these misinterpretations of the First Amendment? If so, then this is the heart of the matter that pertains to this discussion. Congress did not pass any laws in this case. So please deliver for us the law that Judge Moore violated, so that the Federal Judge could then render the unfavorable judgment against him. After all, if the Federal Judge ordered him removed from the bench, and that judgment was based upon an illegal interpretation of the law, then Judge Moores rights have been violated. Morph >> But then again maybe youre arguing that the federal government should not meddle in the affairs of how a state government should run its state. In that case I would agree with you, I think the federal government should get out of the business of decided how states should run their state (making the Federal Marriage Amendment bogus but thats neither here nor there). Terrals reply >> No sir. I am for the federal judges intervening in state cases where laws have been broken. However, I want to know precisely what law Judge Moore violated. Thus far it appears that he ****** off some atheists who originated a federal lawsuit, which prompted the Federal Judge to misapply the First Amendment to this case. Therefore, the original judgment to remove the monument was illegal. The judgment to remove Judge Moore from the bench was based upon an illegal judgment, and was also illegal. This does not even begin to address the issue of Judge Moores First Amendment rights of freedom of expression. Morph >> However (you knew it was coming) if a state government passes a law, or performs an action that undermines the federal constitution, then the action or law is not permissible. If a state constitution allowed for a ban on gun ownership, and a law was passed putting into effect a ban on gun ownership, the federal government would have the power to step in and overrule the ban. In this case the district judge found the monument to be unconstitutional, and so it was in his power to tell Moore what to do. Terrals reply >> Your writing skills appear very precise, when supporting your own views, and conveniently the opposite when the rights of others are being walked upon. The monument has no rights in this or any other case. Laws and judgments (not inanimate objects) are either constitutional or they are not. The placement of this particular monument does not equate to congress passing any law. Nor did placing the statue violate anyones freedom of religion. Therefore, you can misinterpret and misapply the First Amendment to this case to validate the end you seek. Even though both of us know full well that there is nothing legal about it. Morph >> If you want to continue the idea that there the government actually can pass laws that support religions, or subtly support one religion over another, then fine. Well discuss that. But digest the above first. Terrals reply >> No sir. Thus far I am standing firmly with the statement of GreatMoose and his comment about the misinterpretation of the First Amendment. Originally Posted by Terral >> What about the rights of Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, and the God fearing folks from the great state of Alabama? Morph >> Since he was acting as a government official, in the setting of a government building, his actions represent government policy. Terrals reply >> Hogwash. To be removed from the bench, he must have violated a law. You keep saying government, when the wording of the First Amendment says congress. Government does not equal congress, and Judge Moore did not pass any laws. Again, please remember that this debate is not about whether we agree or disagree with Judge Moores right to place the monument there in the first place. It is about how the Federal Judge applied the First Amendment to this case. That is a subtle difference, yes, but a fairly important one. Morph >> He is free to erect a statue of the Ten Commandments on his front porch if he feels like it. Terrals reply >> Our First Amendment rights begin at home, but do not cease to exist on our front porches. What reason was given for the installation of the monument in the first place? The chief justice testified during the trial that the commandments are the moral foundation of American law. He said he installed the monument partly because of his concern that the country has suffered a moral decline over the past 40 or 50 years as a result of federal court rulings, including those against prayer in public schools. From the article: http://www.abcactionnews.com/stories...9tencomm.shtml . The Federal Judge is reported to have said, Thompson said he does not believe all Ten Commandment displays in government buildings are illegal, but he said the monument Moore placed in the rotunda of the state building crosses the line ""between the permissible and the impermissible."" So the placing of Ten Commandment displays in government buildings is not illegal, but this Federal Judge believes this particular monument crosses the line. Okay, what line? Criminals cross the line the moment they commit an illegal act and break a particular law. In jury trials, it is not for the judge to determine innocence or guilt. That is the duty of the jury in the case. The judge is there to ensure that the law is properly applied to the case. That is all fine and dandy. Again, which law did Judge Moore break? Morph >> In the same way any individual can be as much of a bigot as they please. However when acting as a government representative, they are not entitled to express those views. Terrals reply >> More hogwash. Judge Moore was not being an extremist or racist in any way, and bigotry has nothing to do with this case. He sat in a position that gave him a good perspective on what he perceived to be a terrible problem. He associated the moral decline in his home state with terrible decisions rendered by the same Federal Judicial branch that removed him from the bench. This case is about a Christian State Judge and his ******* contest with the all powerful Federal Judge and the atheists who used him by initiating the law suit. You will convince me that Judge Moore deserved to be removed from the bench, the moment you let us all know the laws he has broken. Morph >> A private store owner can refuse service to a black patron simply because they are black but to deny justice to someone because of their skin color is unconstitutional. And in the same way that Moore didnt actually pass any laws, discriminating against black people in a court room is not actually passing a law but this still makes it a violation of the constitution. Terral s reply >> Well, your post shines in some places, and not so much in others. Judge Moore did not violate anything in our Constitution. The Federal Judge has yet to prove to me that the State Judge did one thing against the law. The evidence seems to indicate that the Federal Judge misapplied the First Amendment to this case, and then based the judgment to remove Moore from the bench on that illegal decision.

The things of the spirit are foolishness to the natural man. Scripture says, But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised. But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he himself is appraised by no one. 1Cor. 2:14+15. Morph >> I would not support any kind of government action to modify any kind of symbol from the private sector. So I dont want to remove Gods name and religious symbols from everything in America. I just want to remove them from government agencies that explicitly state they will not have such symbols. Terrals reply >> You would remove these symbols, based upon what law? The government is We The People. The people we elect to represent us are well capable of determining the need of the moment, and have every right to freely exercise their faith in any way they see fit. Congress is forbidden to pass any law that prohibits the free exercise of religion . . . period. Federal Judges are to apply those laws to each individual case, and outside the law they have no jurisdiction whatsoever. Therefore, before you can go around and remove anything from our public places, you must prove to some judge someplace that a law has been violated. Morph >> As you may or may not have noticed above (about Moore and the ten commandments) I didnt say one way or the other whether I thought what he did was right or wrong, or even if the ten commandments should be there. I just said that the federal government had jurisdiction, and they acted on it. Terrals reply >> Again, I will agree with you the instant that you show us which law Moore violated.

This is about the decision of the Federal Judge to remove Judge Moore from office, and any law that Moore violated. Did Moore violate anything in the First Amendment by placing the monument? Was the Federal Judges judgment to remove it legal or illegal? Did the Federal Judge accurately apply the First Amendment to this case? Or, did he misinterpret the law? Originally Posted by Terral >> However, be mindful of the fact that we are living in a day where homosexuals have sprung aggressively from their closets seeking rights from our government, while at the same time faction groups (not all atheists) from among atheists want to remove God from everything.

Both groups are able to marry a member of the opposite sex and have children and grandchildren. The same laws apply to both groups. Homos are seeking extra rights. Morph >> Well if they are entitled to those rights as humans, what is the problem? As for atheists, please find me an atheist who wants you to remove references to God in your private house and then maybe Ill consider your assertion that any single person wants to remove God from everything.

The homos are the ones who belong in the closet. But now, they are free to parade their deviant behavior in the streets. According to you, it is Christians who are free to express their religion, but only at home. So your equal rights BS above is not holding water here. Morph >> You do realize that government buildings and organizations are very different from the individuals that the constitution provided for right? Terrals reply >> Are you referring to our Public buildings where our duly elected officials work daily in representing We The People? When exactly did our elected officials cease to also be We The People? And when did our Constitution stop protecting their right to exercise their free speech, religion, etc.? Judge Moore saw the need to place this monument, and he acted within his Constitutional right to freedom of expression. If the people of Alabama felt that Judge Moore was wrong, then they had it within their power to remove him from office. Originally Posted by Terral >> However, our elected officials (like Judge Roy Moore and everyone else) have the right to freely exercise their faith in any way they see fit, under the First Amendment.

Are you saying that the tradition of atheists running to Federal Judges in order to remove state judges from state benches is somehow hurting other atheists who do actually violate the law?

Morph >> However when others are subjected to the same situation its just an unfortunate circumstance. Terrals reply >> I believe your assertion here to be invalid. What is unfortunate about rubbing shoulders with a member of the typical God-fearing, church-going, Bible-thumping Christian? Are Christian values necessarily bad? I do believe you could be born into a situation that is far worse. Morph >> I am not fighting for an atheistic country, but rather a religiously neutral country. When given the choice between God, No God and silence, I choose for the government to be silent. Please tell me you understand the distinction. Terrals reply >> No sir. Our founding fathers were religious or they were not. The freedom to exercise ones own faith is part of the First Amendment, because the majority (if not all) were definitely religious and held to spiritual truths. Every single one of us has the right to exercise their faith (or lack thereof) in any way we see fit, or we do not. There is no sitting on the fence. Since you side with the Federal Judge in this particular case, then your words here do not match your convictions. Had the Federal Judge accurately interpreted the First Amendment, in his dealings with Judge More, then he would have supported his right to freely exercise and express himself. Thompson stated for the record that, he does not believe all Ten Commandment displays in government buildings are illegal. And yet he ruled otherwise in this particular case. All of the people have the right to freedom of religion all the time. That is the meaning of the First Amendment words free exercise thereof. For the record, again: Bill of Rights Amendment I Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or PROHIBITING THE FREE EXERCISE THEREOF; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
