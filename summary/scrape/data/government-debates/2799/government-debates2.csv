"07-27-2004","2799",2,"terral03","None","Greetings to GreatMoose and All: Well, you stole my thunder there Moose . . . Most people have the wrong idea about what the Bill of Rights say about our freedom of expression and religion. GreatMoose original >> One of the biggest misconceptions about the ""Separation of Church and State"" is that it is in the Constitution. It's not. The only thing the Constitution says about the topic is that ""Congress shall make no law regarding the ESTABLISHMENT of religion (meaning an official religion, like England's Anglican Church), or the free exercise thereof."" It's funny, it's actually the last part (free exercise) that is being violated by the ""no prayer in schools"" laws and the like. Terral >> You are 100 percent correct. As it is written, _________________________________________________ Bill of Rights Amendment I Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or PROHIBITING THE FREE EXERCISE THEREOF; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. __________________________________________________ Terral continues >> So we have the absolute right to freely exercise our faith, as we see fit; at home, in the street, at school or anywhere. It is funny that atheists are willing to stand up for their freedom of speech, while at the same time they seek to prohibit the exercise of our freedom of religion. What? You believe that atheists believe in nothing? Sure they do, and they are seeking to push those things on the rest of us. Professing Christians are in the majority in this great nation. These people pushing atheism and humanistic values represent the tail trying desperately to wag the dog. Who should represent us in congress? Will it be believers or unbelievers? Christians everywhere should take up collections for the gas to put into their church buses, so that each and every one of them can make it to the voting polls. Put people into office that will stand up and fight for our freedom of expression; freedom of speech, freedom of the press AND freedom of religion. Otherwise, one day, we all may find ourselves standing in the stench of someone elses unbelief. God bless, Terral","Mach","60065","I'm shocked at this. 1.

I hope everyone understands the two pillars this ""great nation"" was founded on. At least that's what I was taught, and have since come to admire and understand. 3.

The current trend is demonstrated in stories like this one: http://www.abcactionnews.com/stories...9tencomm.shtml Judge orders Ten Commmandments removed from Alabama courthouse an Associated Press report 11/19/02 MONTGOMERY, Ala. - The chief justice of Alabama's Supreme Court vowed to appeal a federal judge's order that he remove a Ten Commandments monument from the rotunda of the state's judicial building. __________________________________________________ ___________ And this one showing that the same judge was removed from office: http://www.0xdeadbeef.org/blog/jake/...es/005014.html NOVEMBER 13, 2003 TEN COMMANDMENTS JUDGE REMOVED FROM BENCH About XXXXXXn time... __________________________________________________ ________ We also have examples like this, advocating new a new pledge of allegiance; taking God out of the equation: http://4forums.com/political/showthread.php?t=2706 Morph >> You can pray in public, pray in private, pray for me or to me, or even try to convince me to start praying. You can even send your kids off to school and have them pray. Those actions are outside the jurisdiction of the government, and they infringe on no one elses rights. Terrals reply >> What about the rights of Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, and the God fearing folks from the great state of Alabama? Again, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or PROHIBITING THE FREE EXERCISE THEREOF . . . The Federal Judges order to remove the monument violated the free exercise of someones religion. Judge Roy Moore did not make a law respecting the establishment of any religion; nor did he interpret any such law to establish anything. Instead, he was removed from office for not prohibiting the free exercise thereof. But, this debate is not about one particular chunk of rock or the rights of a single individual. It is about the gradual erosion of personal religious freedoms that is currently going on in this country. Morph >> But in the same way you wouldn't want uncle sam to tell your kids or you how to, or when to pray, I want the same courtesy. Terrals reply >> Removing Gods name and religious symbols from everything in America is not going to guarantee you anything. Those things are present in our society for a reason. Our forefathers before us placed them there as an exercise of their freedom of religion. I am very sorry that all of you atheists in America were born into a country that has adhered to Judeo-Christian values from day one. Morph >> Fine that's all well and good that you want bible thumping christians in congress to represent you, but be aware that even if a bible thumping congress wants to do something unconstitutional, REGARDLESS of how much of a majority of the population supports them, it is still unconstitutional, and is not allowed. Terrals reply >> Your statement here goes without saying. However, be mindful of the fact that we are living in a day where homosexuals have sprung aggressively from their closets seeking rights from our government, while at the same time faction groups (not all atheists) from among atheists want to remove God from everything. Our forefathers did not intend anything like this for their posterity. Morph >> Having school endorsed and enforced religion (or veiled support) is not somehow guaranteeing your ability to practice your religion. It is undermining the parents role. Terrals reply >> Nobody here is advocating the establishment of any religion by government. Our government officials have a big enough job representing everyone from our diverse society without the responsibility of the salvation and building up of their eternal souls. However, our elected officials (like Judge Roy Moore and everyone else) have the right to freely exercise their faith in any way they see fit, under the First Amendment. This is our constitutional guarantee of personal freedom that is currently under fire by left wing extremists.

You all are so great in perceiving what you can't do in this country. You are in your element when you feel you're repressed and in the minority, despite the dog-and-tail analogy I just read. Terrals reply >> Okay. At the top of my wish list . . . I want professing Christians to become more aware of the fact that there are left wing extremists working together to destroy what our forefathers have provided for us. It is not that I personally feel repressed, and professing Christians are not in the minority in the USA. What I do see is the steady erosion of personal religious freedoms in this country. Bill >> Imagine you are in the front of the bus with a megaphone on the way to the polls. What is your message to the passengers? Terrals reply >> Any message I would send them would be given long before that bus ride. Know the candidates and what they do and do not stand for on the important issues. How have those candidates voted in the past? Do they have families themselves? My personal view is that people with families tend to vote according to the long term ramifications, and ask themselves How will this affect my grandchildren? Bill >> That you want only forced school prayer restored? I'm not buying it. Terrals reply >> No sir. What benefit is derived from forcing another to pray? Bill >> Will someone be honest enough to answer: What do you want this country to become? Terrals reply >> My willingness to participate in this discussion is over our personal liberty and the freedom to exercise our faith in any way we see fit. Leave the Pledge Of Allegiance alone; and under God. In God We Trust belongs where it is currently. If one of our representatives wants to see the Ten Commandments on his or her wall, then that is their right, until his or her constituents say differently. Passing down judgments that prohibit the free exercise of religion, as a matter of law, is a violation of liberties guaranteed by our Constitution. Bill >> Where do you want it to go? What is the extent of your demands in this area? Terrals reply >> My words here are written in support of GreatMooses post on this thread, and particularly this statement: The only thing the Constitution says about the topic is that ""Congress shall make no law regarding the ESTABLISHMENT of religion (meaning an official religion, like England's Anglican Church), or the free exercise thereof."" The free exercise thereof is the part that most people fail to recognize and support. Bill >> I get the feeling no religionist would be satisfied until Pat Robertson is president and Jerry Falwellis special counsel. Benny Hinn would be Secretary of Health and Human Services, Oral Roberts the shoe-in for Secretary of Education. Either that or they haven't thought it through to what they're wishing for. Terrals reply >> Very funny. Haha. Nobody here advocates that kind of position. This country desperately needs a person who will better protect the rights of our citizens. Our borders are in shambles, and illegal immigrants are running rampant everywhere in my home state. Employers are being forced to use them to keep up with the competition. Why pay a bricklayer 20 bucks and hour or a laborer 12 bucks, when an illegal will do that for half the price? And Bush says, But they are doing jobs that nobody wants! No, we dont want to be forced to live like illegal immigrants. And the Democrats are no better, and will lose this election for their failure to capitalize on these kinds of issues.

Terral's reply >> While GreatMoose used this phrase, please allow me to offer a reply. While congress has not supported the establishment of any religion, our forefathers saw fit to have a moment of silent prayer, after our Pledge of Allegiance. I remember this moment of silent prayer growing up in the public school system. GreatMoose appears to be acknowledging the fact that a judicial order to remove prayer from the equation is a violation of someones First Amendment rights. After all, congress has no right to create a law that prohibits the free exercise of religion. Are we clear on that aspect? So no judicial order restricting public prayer can possibly be based upon the accurate interpretation of our Constitutional Rights guaranteed under the First Amendment. If my take on this is correct, then he is also not offering any support or constitutional evidence for adding school prayer as being legal either.

But no matter, Ill respond to that point in this post. Concerning the links you provided: It seems the judge was removed from office for refusing to obey a court order, and not for actually installing the Ten Commandments statue. That is a subtle difference, yes, but a fairly important one. His superiors (you could say the Moores boss) decided his view on a matter was incorrect. Judge Moore is not the supreme judge of the land the buck does not stop with him. But then again maybe youre arguing that the federal government should not meddle in the affairs of how a state government should run its state. In that case I would agree with you, I think the federal government should get out of the business of decided how states should run their state (making the Federal Marriage Amendment bogus but thats neither here nor there). However (you knew it was coming) if a state government passes a law, or performs an action that undermines the federal constitution, then the action or law is not permissible. If a state constitution allowed for a ban on gun ownership, and a law was passed putting into effect a ban on gun ownership, the federal government would have the power to step in and overrule the ban. In this case the district judge found the monument to be unconstitutional, and so it was in his power to tell Moore what to do. If you want to continue the idea that there the government actually can pass laws that support religions, or subtly support one religion over another, then fine. Well discuss that. But digest the above first. Since he was acting as a government official, in the setting of a government building, his actions represent government policy. He is free to erect a statue of the Ten Commandments on his front porch if he feels like it. In the same way any individual can be as much of a bigot as they please. However when acting as a government representative, they are not entitled to express those views. A private store owner can refuse service to a black patron simply because they are black but to deny justice to someone because of their skin color is unconstitutional. And in the same way that Moore didnt actually pass any laws, discriminating against black people in a court room is not actually passing a law but this still makes it a violation of the constitution. Hmm I guess Ill have to explicitly state my beliefs in their entirety before I can expect you to make a fairly simple logical step. I would not support any kind of government action to modify any kind of symbol from the private sector. So I dont want to remove Gods name and religious symbols from everything in America. I just want to remove them from government agencies that explicitly state they will not have such symbols. As you may or may not have noticed above (about Moore and the ten commandments) I didnt say one way or the other whether I thought what he did was right or wrong, or even if the ten commandments should be there. I just said that the federal government had jurisdiction, and they acted on it. As far as the term God in the pledge, I dont know about your state, but I feel that my state (California) is pretty clear on weather something of that nature should be allowed. [quote = Terral] Our forefathers before us placed them there as an exercise of their freedom of religion. [/quote] in the same way that the founding fathers never mentioned God in the governments governing document, or on printed currency, or in the pledge? No, you must mean a different group of forefathers perhaps maybe the forefathers from the cold war who wanted to stick it to the godless pinko commie atheists by putting God on our money and into the pledge. as a side note, when examining the ten commandments not even half of them are actually expressed in US law. 1) No Gods before me: First amendment prohibits this kind of law. 2) No graven images: Not as explicitly forbidden as commandment 1, however this kind of law would probably never be passed as infringes on practice of religion. 3) No taking Gods name in vain: First amendment also prohibits this kind of law. 4) No breaking of the Sabbath: again, no laws regarding what to do on any given day, and congress would be hard pressed to pass such a law. 5) No dishonoring parents: While is socially encouraged, there is no explicit law. Parents have legal jurisdiction over their children, but this says nothing about the childrens obligations to their parents. 6) No Murder: Ta-da, this is in fact illegal 7) No adultery: Not too sure about this one. Im guessing there are not many laws prohibiting sleeping around however I am fairly confident such laws are not enforced much. At any rate, to be on the safe side Ill say government law does express this. 8) No stealing: Yup, there are legal repercussions if we steal. 9) No Perjury: well, there is no law against lying in generalhowever it is a crime to lie and break contracts. Ok Ill give up this one to. So thats 4 so far. 10) No coveting: Im pretty sure I dont know exactly what covet means in this context but if it means desire, or to want then there is no law against desiring or wanting something. So of the 4 (3.5) commandments that are actually expressed in our laws, did they really have to come from the Ten Commandments? Stealing, murdering, and lying are pretty much required for any productive society, and they have definitely been independently developed in religions and societies that didnt have access to the Ten Commandments. gasp, gay people are demanding equal rights? Well if they are entitled to those rights as humans, what is the problem? As for atheists, please find me an atheist who wants you to remove references to God in your private house and then maybe Ill consider your assertion that any single person wants to remove God from everything. You do realize that government buildings and organizations are very different from the individuals that the constitution provided for right? Including giving harsher sentences to homosexuals because their behavior is an abomination? Or awarding custody to the father (aka leader of the household) over the mother for no reason at all? As a representative of the government, their first and foremost responsibility is to uphold the ideals of the constitution and the government of the United States. In this case their religion does not come first, and their religion can not come first. When there is a conflict between the two ideals, the constitution will win. In your world it would be somehow tragic if the government represented a religious view that was different form yours however when other are subjected to the same situation its just an unfortunate circumstance. I am not fighting for an atheistic country, but rather a religiously neutral country. When given the choice between God, No God and silence, I choose for the government to be silent.

Tradition or ""being done this way before you were born"", has nothing to do with something being constitutional or unconstitutional. Sorry. And yes, an example is slavery. While I'm sure some son of a son of a slave owner would love his field-hands and house servants back under his yoke, it's now, illegal, and unconstitutional. So yes, it doesn't work the way you'd like it to work. Some people call it progress. 2. Our country being founded on majority rule and minority rights is not a misconception. Type those words into google and let me know what you find, it will be obvious that I didn't dream up what our government is about. 3. This is the crux of our argument, seriously, this will save you some headaches down the road if you just walk with me here. - You can pray in school, or anywhere you feel like it. - The government should not pass laws or keep laws on the books that respect or establish any religion. - Therefore, the government cannot make or uphold a law that requires government (tax payer funded) institutions to respect any religion, which schools are a part of. They cannot make a law that REQUIRES people to pray or respects ""Prayer time"", or any other religious buzz word things. So, there is no ambiguity there. You can pray in school, it just cannot be MANDATED by the school. I.e. the government cannot tell anyone they need to pray, or worship, or pause and reflect on a higher power. However, you can do these things on your own volition. You see, that's why the law is good, and your desire to see Christianity spread by our government = bad. 4. Last I checked we had three branches of government, and indeed, you're wrong, judges and congress have a great deal to do with what's legal and what's not. The suprement court's rulings are..supreme, and congress certainly does work hard to get bills turned into laws. So yes, they can make bills that do, well, most anything, and some even become laws. There are checks and balances in place, but yeah, that's their job and stuff. 5. The ACLU fights for everyone's civil liberties, and they often team up with the Christian Coalition if some religious people or groups get their rights trampled on. They take a lot of negative press for some reason from the religious right...not sure why. Maybe it's because their goal is to fight the ""systematic erosion of our personal freedoms"". That's just an FYI. No, I don't stand by, by the way. 6. Religion in public places = places paid for by tax payer dollars = government supporting that religion = violation of establishment clause = bad. That's just a reiteration of #3. 7. The alabama judge you mention is a criminal, and was treated like one. He was in the wrong, in so many ways. And he was taken care of. You don't decide you ""don't like the law"" and just go breaking them. That's called..anarchy, or criminal, or breaking the law..you know the routine.
