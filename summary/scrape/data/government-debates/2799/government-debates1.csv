What's this stuff about faith based initiatives? Isn't that just another way to circumvent the separation of church and state? What about all these religious leaders praising one party over another and pushing for their followers to vote for this candidate or that candidate? I don't think it should be allowed. What about the oath the newly elected president takes to ""uphold and defend the constitution of the United States""? Ignoring, attempting to ammend it, or working around it seems to be common these days. People get mad when prayer was taken out of schools. What if you were a Christian and the Government said you must say ""in the name of Alla's name we pray"" would you still want prayer in school? I think that not paying attention to the consititution, as it was written, really sucks!","i-think-constitutional-separation-church-state-should-upheld","05:33 PM","government-debates","1"
"07-23-2004","2799",1,"None","None","None","Anastasia","59549","I think that separation of church and state is often misunderstood. It really means Freedom FROM religion.... Freedom from religion does not mean, as some might mistakenly believe, being free from seeing religion in society. No one has the right not to see churches, religious expression, and other examples of religious belief in our nation. What freedom from religion does mean, however, is the freedom from the rules and dogmas of other people's religious beliefs so that we can be free to follow the demands of our own conscience, whether they take a religious form or not. If it were to be really separate, wouldn't our money not have ""In GOD we trust"" etc etc... Plus a lot of people do not realize that the majority of people voting are religious and that will show in who gets elected... May not seem fair but it certainly is there...","i-think-constitutional-separation-church-state-should-upheld","05:52 PM","government-debates","2"

It took Saddam 400,000 troops, a large national civil police force, a secret police force with unlimited powers and a fist of steel to control Iraq. We're saying our political ideology will eventually be openly accepted with 160,000 troops when we kill off what, 60% of the population to meet Saddam's control ratios?","i-think-constitutional-separation-church-state-should-upheld","08:35 AM","government-debates","4"
"07-26-2004","2799",1,"None","None","None","GreatMoose","59830","One of the biggest misconceptions about the ""Separation of Church and State"" is that it is in the Constitution. It's not. The only thing the Constitution says about the topic is that ""Congress shall make no law regarding the ESTABLISHMENT of religion (meaning an official religion, like England's Anglican Church), or the free exercise thereof."" It's funny, it's actually the last part (free exercise) that is being violated by the ""no prayer in schools"" laws and the like.","i-think-constitutional-separation-church-state-should-upheld","12:18 PM","government-debates","5"
"07-26-2004","2799",1,"None","None","None","terral03","59856","Greetings to GreatMoose and All: Well, you stole my thunder there Moose . . . Most people have the wrong idea about what the Bill of Rights say about our freedom of expression and religion. GreatMoose original >> One of the biggest misconceptions about the ""Separation of Church and State"" is that it is in the Constitution. It's not. The only thing the Constitution says about the topic is that ""Congress shall make no law regarding the ESTABLISHMENT of religion (meaning an official religion, like England's Anglican Church), or the free exercise thereof."" It's funny, it's actually the last part (free exercise) that is being violated by the ""no prayer in schools"" laws and the like. Terral >> You are 100 percent correct. As it is written, _________________________________________________ Bill of Rights Amendment I Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or PROHIBITING THE FREE EXERCISE THEREOF; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. __________________________________________________ Terral continues >> So we have the absolute right to freely exercise our faith, as we see fit; at home, in the street, at school or anywhere. It is funny that atheists are willing to stand up for their freedom of speech, while at the same time they seek to prohibit the exercise of our freedom of religion. What? You believe that atheists believe in nothing? Sure they do, and they are seeking to push those things on the rest of us. Professing Christians are in the majority in this great nation. These people pushing atheism and humanistic values represent the tail trying desperately to wag the dog. Who should represent us in congress? Will it be believers or unbelievers? Christians everywhere should take up collections for the gas to put into their church buses, so that each and every one of them can make it to the voting polls. Put people into office that will stand up and fight for our freedom of expression; freedom of speech, freedom of the press AND freedom of religion. Otherwise, one day, we all may find ourselves standing in the stench of someone elses unbelief.

It implies support of one religious ideal over another which (coming from the state) is unacceptable.","i-think-constitutional-separation-church-state-should-upheld","01:06 PM","government-debates","7"

It does not say ""State religion"" but simply ""religion"". It seems to me that one's freedom to have no religion is not being respected when one is forced to say ""under God"". Are non-believers not as ""American"" as believers?","i-think-constitutional-separation-church-state-should-upheld","01:30 PM","government-debates","8"

You can pray in public, pray in private, pray for me or to me, or even try to convince me to start praying. You can even send your kids off to school and have them pray. Those actions are outside the jurisdiction of the government, and they infringe on no one elses rights. But in the same way you wouldn't want uncle sam to tell your kids or you how to, or when to pray, I want the same courtesy. Fine that's all well and good that you want bible thumping christians in congress to represent you, but be aware that even if a bible thumping congress wants to do something unconstitutional, REGARDLESS of how much of a majority of the population supports them, it is still unconstitutional, and is not allowed. Having school endorsed and enforced religion (or veiled support) is not somehow guaranteeing your ability to practice your religion. It is undermining the parents role. like most atheists are now standing in the stench of someone else's belief? but of course you don't want to spin it that way.","i-think-constitutional-separation-church-state-should-upheld","02:20 PM","government-debates","9"

You all are so great in perceiving what you can't do in this country. You are in your element when you feel you're repressed and in the minority, despite the dog-and-tail analogy I just read. Imagine you are in the front of the bus with a megaphone on the way to the polls. What is your message to the passengers? That you want only forced school prayer restored? I'm not buying it. Will someone be honest enough to answer: What do you want this country to become? Where do you want it to go? What is the extent of your demands in this area? I get the feeling no religionist would be satisfied until Pat Robertson is president and Jerry Falwell is special counsel. Benny Hinn would be Secretary of Health and Human Services, Oral Roberts the shoe-in for Secretary of Education. Either that or they haven't thought it through to what they're wishing for. I say we can't serve two masters. We are a secular society; man is the king. Get used to it, it's working well.","i-think-constitutional-separation-church-state-should-upheld","02:21 PM","government-debates","10"
