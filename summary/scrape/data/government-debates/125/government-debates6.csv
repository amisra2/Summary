"12-01-2003","125",6,"None","None","None","Robbie","24871","It is so patronizing to women to lower standards for them. How disgusting. In my opinion, women shouldn't be a part of the army.... however, that is hard to back up. Certainly, I think its been shown here that standards shouldn't be lowered. However, silver has argued well in favor of letting women in at equal standards. (although I think you sound a little brainwashed by feminists considering how you've reacted to some posts... ) -The pregnancy issue seems like a problem -I've heard of an israeli study that showed morale was much worse after women were lost in combat as compared to loss of men (sorry, I have no other information about it) -I think the protective instincts of men are a valid consideration This is basically an opinion, but feel free to argue it. Oh, and I can't believe you could suggest mandatory abortions, Chai!!!!!!","women-combat","01:35 AM","government-debates","80"
"12-01-2003","125",6,"Truth Seeker","None","Believe me, I am not Patriot under another name. :D ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Why shouldnt women be allowed into military combat? There are distinct physical differences between men and women. ( I hope we can at least agree on this point.) There are also distinct mental differences between men and women. I oppose women in combat for: 1) psychological reasons 2) physical reasons 3) moral reasons 4) religious reasons Psychologically, the majority of men are better able to take on antagonistic forces than women are. The morale of men is much easier to keep up than that of women. Physically, the majority of men have more strength and endurance than women do. Morally, it is wrong to have men and women use the same sleeping, washing, and living facilities. I believe that there are same-sex barracks, but I don't know that it is the general rule. Does anybody know? Also women going into combat face the possibility of becoming POWs. If men are treated cruelly as POW's, just imagine how a woman would be treated. Remember that women are not held in very high regard or with any respect in many countries of the world. Speaking from a religious point of view, men are leaders and protectors. Women help men to be more effective in everything that they do. This in no way implies that women are inferior beings. Men and women have different roles. The issue is not whether women are capable of being in the military or capable of fighting. The issue is whether or not it is a good idea to make an exception to the rule. Should we allow women in the military because some women meet all the physical and mental requirements to join? I would say no, because it is not a job that women should do. Maybe they are capable, but they shouldn't, because when women become just like men and act just like men then all the refinery and femininity tend to go out the window. These niceties of life are what make life more pleasant. The point is, is that men and women ARE ""different"". Hence, we are better suited mentally and physically for ""different"" occupations. Note: In many of my statements I refer to a general rule and not the exception. Keep in mind that there are always exceptions. However, I do not believe in ""rule by a few"", even though I am afraid this very often happens.","bud095","24908","well you want equality isnt that a b.......h! their shouldnt be any female boss,s because their not physically able to perform the job than . they shouldnt be able to vote either !they want the good things but dont want the responsability!if i take a bullit in combat because im a man and a women doesnt because shes a women thats not equality! thats reverse discrimination you gotta take the bad with the good!","women-combat","12:34 PM","government-debates","81"

I think the most sad and ironic thing about some modern femenists is their focus on career, and their disgust for 'house wives'. Who's more important to society - a buisnessperson or a mom? It seems obvious to me that mom is more important. The whole purpose of working is to support the family, after all. And that's the ironic thing... chauvanist (sp) men have convinced our society that the Man's career is more important than the intricate, challenging, and incredible thing called mothering. Yet, rather than fight this, many femenists actually support it! They ridicule what I think is one of the most basic and good instincts in life. Male domination and condescension had/has such a hold on our society that people think that the only equality is for women to do what men were doing - they are convinced that men have it better, and that women are unimportant unless they do what men do. Ironic, and very sad.","women-combat","01:30 PM","government-debates","86"

"12-01-2003","125",6,"Patriot","None","I'm against women in combat, for many reasons. For instance, women in combat aren't segregated. Meaning, there aren't all-men platoons or all-women platoons. That presents a moral problem. It just isn't a good idea. why not! On the other software, the point about women POWs was brought up. That is something that I never had thought of, but it certainly is food for thought. do you think male pows are treated any better! American pointed out on the other software that the nations we are likely to be fighting with in the near future are Islamic by nature. He gave the example of how we lost many a good man because their opponents wouldn't surrender to a woman. Not to mention what our Islamic allies would think of having a woman commander equal or greater in rank to them.they wouldnt surrender to a man either!

"12-21-2003","125",6,"None","None","None","witzelcheck","28693","Ok, I just spent quite a while reading this entire thread... I can see the main arguements are coming from Patriot, and Silver as well as a few others. I'm with Silver for the most part. I'm 18, I'm female, I took the ASVAB and got a rather... HIGH score on it for what it means. (dunno if I can release that.. better not) I meet all of the physical requirements... and I'm now enlisted in the Marines. I took the test with mostly guys... and somehow managed to surpass the majority. Am I not qualified? I handle myself well in emergency situations. I'm very mentally alert. It's also been proven that women can concentrate on more things at once than guys can, for what that's worth. I signed that line for several reasons. I want to serve this country and give back what it has given me, if necessary. And what the hell, there are some guys out there who aren't qualified to, or simply won't. To Put it simply. Some men don't qualify, and some women do. My recruiter was a male. He seemed to have no problem with me being female and wasn't phased the least. Neither were all the other males that were with me when we were sworn in. I don't know why people on the field would feel any different. Then again, I don't have that experince. Help me out there, Silver. heh. As for male's protective instincts or whatever... what about female's protective instincts. Aren't they noted for being the more protective parent. Or maybe I was taught wrong. Whatever And seriously, how much of that protective instinct is going to be directed at just a female, rather than the rest of the fighters on the field? Are men just not strong enough to overcome that instinct and do his job? (Ok, that sounded really sexist, and I'm sorry, but it's a point) His job is to protect his country and fellow fighters, not a specific one. So then do the job. I'm beginning to convince myself that I'm really biased. wow. I'm just typing my thoughts though. These are questions I was never presented with before and got me thinking. I like that. Anyway, another reason I joined was because of family history. Many of my relatives (both male and female) were in the military, and when asked, say they wouldn't trade it for the world. I'm doing it because I want to make something of myself, my wheels are spinning, I'm not challenged, and I need something to motivate my life. What's better than serving my country? I also joined because even though I'm young, I know that wealth doesn't come in the form of money, it comes in the form of experince. Everyone I've talked to that's been in the military say that they now have a completely new, better outlook on life. I want that. I guess I think the services are just the way to go if you want a worthwhile experience. (once again, Silver, help me out there... is that anywhere near the truth?) So it's not just about fighting to me. It's about serving, it's about knowledge, it's about experience, and it's about pride (and I don't mean being conceited). So then why can't I join the Military? I'm not in it for that equal rights XXXX. I know many females (and yes, they do outnumber the males, but that's because society has shaped them to be so) that are NOT qualified. I am. So should I waste that qualification? I think I could do the country a service (and NOT hinder them... ) and I am determined to do so.","women-combat","12:55 AM","government-debates","89"
