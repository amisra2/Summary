"02-19-2003","125",3,"None","None","None","American","2571","What ""real young"" guys are you talking about? You have to be at least 17 to be in the military (and that is with parental consent).","women-combat","02:31 PM","government-debates","32"
"02-19-2003","125",3,"None","None","None","sarablaze","2576","Im saying, 17 is really young. What if a 28 year old, and an 18 year old out there. The older guys would naturally look after the young ones.","women-combat","06:57 PM","government-debates","33"
"02-19-2003","125",3,"None","None","None","American","2583","I don't know where you get your info, but I talk with military officers and troops almost every day, and all of them say that having another man in the trenches is imperative to keeping a unit at peak ability. Interestingly enough one of the officers is in his mid-twenties and he said that there is very little pressure caused by having a younger man next to him, but when you put a woman there he ""get[s] all nervous, and [he] can't concentrate on [his] mission.""","women-combat","08:46 PM","government-debates","34"

"02-20-2003","125",3,"None","None","None","American","2612","Sarablaze, Oh, I'm sure someone could think of a way to keep the guys and gals separated, but what would be the cost? Lives. Lives lost needlessly because some women determined that they could do everything as well as a man. Women in cambat is a more than a bad idea, it is a deadly one.","women-combat","12:48 PM","government-debates","36"
"02-22-2003","125",3,"None","None","None","sarablaze","2789","Yeah, yeah, yeah! The reason for that is because of the way you MEN think!!! LOL:D","women-combat","05:46 AM","government-debates","37"
"03-14-2003","125",3,"None","None","None","Debater","4745","well the reason you think that is because you're a women!","women-combat","12:34 PM","government-debates","38"
"03-20-2003","125",3,"None","None","None","(Tony)","5255","I'm doing a project on women in combat, and i just wanted to hear you opinions on the thing, so i can get some good views, and make somes stats. As in if ""all males"" are for it or if ""Females"" are against it too, i just wanted to hear your opinions, and any help here would be great.","women-combat","07:50 PM","government-debates","39"

"03-21-2003","125",3,"None","None","None","Patriot","5302","I'm a guy who's against women in combat. However, you'll find that you can't divide the debate along gender lines, I know many girls who are opposed to it, as well as several guys who are for it.","women-combat","02:02 PM","government-debates","41"
"03-22-2003","125",3,"None","None","None","debategirl88","5336","Im for it, and Im a girl. I think women in combat would help this country. The only problem is that it can also be bad. Im for it because a soldier is a soldier, and if we need soldiers Im volunteering. Although Im against drafting women. That might start a civil war, because of angree fathers.","women-combat","10:48 AM","government-debates","42"
"03-26-2003","125",3,"None","None","None","Silver46","5654","For those of you talking about the physical requirements, you make it sound like women can't meet them. Were any of you actually IN the military? I'm a woman, and I served my time in the military in my early 20s. The physical requirements of the APFT (even for men) were pathetic. You had to be seriously out of shape not to make them. It's not as hard as some of these people would have you believe. MANY women can qualify using the male tables. As for not being able to concentrate when you have women in your unit, well that's the sort of thing that will change with change. Fighting alongside a woman will force these men to let go of their sexist, degrading opinions of women as helpless babymakers who need to be protected because they're too fragile to care for themselves. Yes, there will be some internal problems when women join the fighting forces in full numbers. The sociological ramifications will be a good thing rather than a bad thing. Men will learn to change their outdated thinking. As for arabs not surrendering to women, well the current conflict has taught us otherwise. Arabs are surrendering to units with female apache pilots (who are using the loudspeakers, so don't say the arabs don't know) in droves. Kinda throws that argument out the window, eh?","women-combat","02:24 PM","government-debates","43"
"03-26-2003","125",3,"None","None","None","Patriot","5656","No, actually, I haven't had the pleasure of serving (yet.) However, I have made it a point to study the military deveolop ties within the military. So I think I can speak with a bit of knowledge on the subject. I would ask you to keep refering to ""men"" when you talk about ""let[ting] go of sexist, degrading opinions of women"" and ""outdated thinking"" because you cannot divide the issue by gender. I know many women who are stronger in their opposition to this subject than I am, as well as many guys who are just as for women in combat.","women-combat","02:41 PM","government-debates","44"
