When I say ""yet"" it does not mean that I am ""like 15 years old."" Your assessment that I don't know any women beyond my family and teachers is.... interesting. Yes, you can make a blanket statement and say ""men"" when refering to the people who oppose women in combat, but such an assessment is far from just. By your reasoing, I may say ""the poor"" when I refer to those who break the law, because arguably, the poor commit more crimes than the rich. I'm thinking of conducting such a survey that you advise (in regards to why the females I mentioned oppose women in combat.) I would suggest you do the same. Next: about the draft. You say the draft has been abolished. In that case, why did I have to send in a Selective Service card on my 18th birthday? Obviously, so if there was ever a need, the draft could be reinstituted. So while our armed forces are all-volunteer today, that could change if we fight a major war. You also submit that the women volunteering for combat and drafting women for combat are 2 different things. Maybe so, but allowing women in combat is a step down the road to drafting them for the same purpose. You may argue, but if women weren't allowed to volunteer for combat, they'd never be able to be drafted. I would like to point out I am not saying that women shouldn't serve in the military AT ALL... I'm opposing it in the area of combat. You can serve your country more than adequately in a non-combat role. I also think you misunderstand my opinion of women. I do not think that women are ""inferior"" but they were created different. Just like a screwdriver is different from a hammer. Niether one is inferior to the other, and with some difficulty, you can even get them to do each other's job (I've done it myself). But it isn't what they were made for.","women-combat","02:07 PM","government-debates","47"
"03-30-2003","125",4,"None","None","None","squirt1983","5908","Wow, silver46!! my thoughts exactly. I know exactly where you are coming from and I feel the same way. I don't think that just because we are women that we are ""inferior"" and can't perform the same way. I don't think that just because we are women, we should be allowed into the military for a limited purpose. It sounds to me that some of these guys think that we should be pregnant, and walking around the kitchen in our bare feet. I don't think so! If we meet the same standards and can perform the same duties efficiently, then why the hell can't we serve our country right beside them? As for me, I am in the military, and during training, the females were held to the same physical standards as the males. We met the same standards and passed the same tests and can perform our duties just as well, if not better, than any male. This country, The United States of America, is my country. I will fight for it to the best of my ability. I am willing to give my life for my country, that is why I signed that dotted line. Not for any of that ""equal rights"" XXXX!! Because this is my country, and just like those that came before me, who died so I can have this freedom to choose, I choose to fight and even die for my country!!","women-combat","09:57 PM","government-debates","49"
"03-31-2003","125",4,"None","None","None","Patriot","5966","Silver, If you think the only people who can speak about military service knowlegebly are those who have served, than you may ignore everything I say. Because I haven't served. On the other hand, if I read what people who have been in the service have said, and spoken to them personally, than we can continue. Those are my sources. In relation to the survey you suggested... are you saying that your findings that tell what most women think about combat service and the draft came from women in the military? You say, ""You still register for selective service because the government likes to be able to keep track of adult men."" Keep track of them for what? For the DRAFT. That's what selective service is all about. Next, when I say I'm not saying they are inferior, just different, you say: ""Of course you're not. You'd like the wimminfolk around to clean up after and feed the men in this real man's army! Gotta let them in the military for that, right?? They can serve their country by cooking and cleaning and playing nurse!"" All this belies your own military experience, during which you came into contact with more non-combatants than just those who ""cook[ed] clean[ed] and play[ed] nurse."" As to your examples of women currently in combat. I'm afraid I cannot take the ""wars"" we've had since integration as an acid test. Even the current conflict is pretty easy, you have to admit. The average Iraqi infantryman is no match for an average American anybody. All this doesn't mean that women aren't functioning well. I believe the problem (with women in combat) is deeper than that. Why do I think that men make better soldiers than women? I believe the military is STILL over 50% male!","women-combat","02:39 PM","government-debates","50"
"04-02-2003","125",4,"None","None","None","Patriot","6041","Well then. Since my words on the subject are next to worthless. Here is a quote from a Marine who posted on the old site: ""Women in the military? yes. Women in front-line combat? no. I do not want to sound sexist or anything, but just the logistics of it are overwhelming. Face it: women have certain..er... biological differances that make combat impractical. Supporting women in the field would take lots of time and money. Not to mention that being surrounded by young, horny men constantly would lead to certain....complications not found in current front line units. But don't get me wrong, if I'm in a fighting hole, I want the person next to me to be able to shoot as well as possible, I just don't want the distraction of it being a female."" A quote from Anita Blair, chairman of the Congressional Commission on Military Training and Gender-Related Issues in 1994: ""As a result of my work on the commission, I became convinced that the objective for many who advocate a greater female influence in the armed services isnot so much to conquer the military as conquer manhood: They aim to mak the most quintessentially masculine of our institutions more feminine."" I concur. In a previous post you asked why I thought men made better soldiers than women. I replied, ""Why do I think that men make better soldiers than women? I believe the military is STILL over 50% male!"" THAT is the ""relevance of that little factoid."" Now for your questions: 1) Are there any military jobs for which men are unsuited or incapable of performing? I'll say there aren't any. 2) Are there any military jobs for which women are unsuited or incapable of performing? I don't think that it's accurate to say they are incapable for the most part. However, women shouldn't be a part of ""direct combat."" I still say they are different not equal. You only gave me the military to choose from. I don't particularly enjoy being defined as ""sexist"" so perhaps it would help if you'd define what that term means to you.","women-combat","02:41 PM","government-debates","52"
"04-03-2003","125",4,"None","None","None","Patriot","6092","First of all, I would like to apologise for statements I made earlier in this debate that were totally erroneous and wrong. I ask the forgiveness of those who I've offended. I quoted that Marine cause he was someone who was in the military, and I was not. I guess I didn't understand what he was elluding to. If that was the only concern, I concur there would be no need to segregate on the basis of gender. I'll post more later....","women-combat","03:40 PM","government-debates","54"

"04-16-2003","125",4,"None","None","None","Truth Seeker","6736","Sure, but first I would like to ask you several questions if you dont mind. :D Since you were in the military at one time, I would be interested in knowing the following: 1) When you served, did you ever hold a position of authority? For example, you were promoted to a certain rank that required others to follow your orders. 2) If you didnt serve as any kind of authority figure, who were your commanders? Were they mostly men or women? (I am guessing they were mostly men since there are more men in the military at present, but you never know.) 3) If/ When you had women commanders were they treated with respect by both the men and women under them? 4) If/ When you had men commanders were they treated with respect by both the men and women under them?","women-combat","01:36 PM","government-debates","57"
