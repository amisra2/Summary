"04-16-2003","125",5,"None","None","None","Truth Seeker","6759","Believe me, I am not Patriot under another name. :D ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Why shouldnt women be allowed into military combat? There are distinct physical differences between men and women. ( I hope we can at least agree on this point.) There are also distinct mental differences between men and women. I oppose women in combat for: 1) psychological reasons 2) physical reasons 3) moral reasons 4) religious reasons Psychologically, the majority of men are better able to take on antagonistic forces than women are. The morale of men is much easier to keep up than that of women. Physically, the majority of men have more strength and endurance than women do. Morally, it is wrong to have men and women use the same sleeping, washing, and living facilities. I believe that there are same-sex barracks, but I don't know that it is the general rule. Does anybody know? Also women going into combat face the possibility of becoming POWs. If men are treated cruelly as POW's, just imagine how a woman would be treated. Remember that women are not held in very high regard or with any respect in many countries of the world. Speaking from a religious point of view, men are leaders and protectors. Women help men to be more effective in everything that they do. This in no way implies that women are inferior beings. Men and women have different roles. The issue is not whether women are capable of being in the military or capable of fighting. The issue is whether or not it is a good idea to make an exception to the rule. Should we allow women in the military because some women meet all the physical and mental requirements to join? I would say no, because it is not a job that women should do. Maybe they are capable, but they shouldn't, because when women become just like men and act just like men then all the refinery and femininity tend to go out the window. These niceties of life are what make life more pleasant. The point is, is that men and women ARE ""different"". Hence, we are better suited mentally and physically for ""different"" occupations. Note: In many of my statements I refer to a general rule and not the exception. Keep in mind that there are always exceptions. However, I do not believe in ""rule by a few"", even though I am afraid this very often happens.","women-combat","06:03 PM","government-debates","62"
"04-17-2003","125",5,"None","None","None","Truth Seeker","6788","Thank-you Silver for clearing up some things for me. Eleanor Maccoby and Carol Jacklin of Stanford University. ""1) Males are more aggressive than females in all human societies for which evidence is available. 2) The sex differences are found early in life, at a time when there is no evidence that differential socialization pressures have been brought to bear by adults to ""shape"" aggression differently in the two sexes. 3) Similar sex differences are found in man and subhuman primates. 4) Aggression is related to levels of sex hormones, and can be changed by experimental administration of these hormones. You say that all recorded wars had women POW's. Can you please show me evidence that shows women were POW's from every recorded war in history as a result of deliberately going out and fighting in combat. ""Christian beliefs have no place in government. Principles such as The Golden Rule that Christianity was founded upon certainly have a place, but they existed before Christianity existed, and as such are irrelevant. Read your constitution. Using religious beliefs as a way of establishing doctrine in the military is expressly forbidden, and as such completely invalidates the point you made above."" First of all, Christianity was not founded upon the Golden Rule. It was founded upon Jesus Christ. (By the way, where is the Golden Rule found?) The point about the roles of men and women really is not wholly related to religion. It really is a fact. Your response to it really depends on your worldview. About different occupations for men and women and which are suitable, I don't want to go there. Why, because it wouldn't make any difference. Either I would be written off as having ""oppressive attitudes toward women"" or just an old-fashioned fuddy-duddy who has to be enlightened to the greatness that feminists have done to free women. However, I will tell you something about the occupations of women. Women should not be in the military, if they are married and have children they should not be in the public workplace, and if they are not married, they need to judge for themselves the wisdom of having a job in the public workplace.","women-combat","11:47 AM","government-debates","64"
"04-17-2003","125",5,"None","None","None","Truth Seeker","6799","I do intend to do some research on the subject. :D Unfortunately the problem runs much deeper than people want to realize. One more thing though...even though this belongs in the religion debates... Jesus Christ existed long before he deigned to come to earth in human form. He was there at the beginning of the world. And quite frankly I am more willing to accept what He has to say on the subject than some scientist of today who was not there. However, that belongs in the Evolution v. Creationism debate. :D The Bible was written over a period of many centuries and its unity quite clearly speaks for itself. It is true that the Golden Rule is an important principle of Christianity. As is ""Love your neighbor as yourself,"" and many other principles. Christianity has existed since Adam and Eve who hoped in the promise of a Savior from their sin. Jesus Christ was that Savior. You can either accept it or reject it. Your decision determines your whole outlook on life.","women-combat","03:30 PM","government-debates","66"
"04-17-2003","125",5,"None","None","None","Truth Seeker","6810","The Old Testament in the Bible indicates the presence of Jesus Christ at the beginning of and before time. I would ask you to give me examples of how the Bible stories disagree with each other, but this is not the place for it. However, I can't ignore what you say here: ""But then again, Christians have shed more blood in the name of religion than any other religion in the history of man..."" Can you prove this statement? A true understanding of Christianity shows that it is not a religion of violence, and you disagree with me so I whack you on the head. Therefore, any examples such as the Inquisition, the Crusades(which simply got out of hand) are not examples of Christianity at work. Just because something says it is Christian doesn't mean it is. You cannot force someone to become a Christian. So, I would like to know, just how many people have died as a result of ""true"" Christians persecuting them? Note: If you feel that this is completely off base for this forum and don't wish to respond, I completely understand. (I am being perfectly sincere, and not trying to sound patronizing) Although I would be interested in knowing what you have to say since you made the statement.","women-combat","07:39 PM","government-debates","68"

Besides, if they really do want to, they'll find a way to do it around the law, so why make stupid laws that people will break anyway??

"06-21-2003","125",5,"None","None","None","grayhawk","10458","Some facts for you from a woman who does not believe that women should be in combat. Center for Strategic & International Studies found that 66% of junior enlisted men did not believe that women could pull their own weight. 44% of junior enlisted women agreed !! DACOWITS (Defense Advisory Commission on Women in the Services): a mostly civilian advisory panel; established 50 years ago to advise the Pentagon on military matters pertaining to women. One female Marine complained that the 3-mile morning run was demeaning to women. The run had to be suspended pending an investigation. Military Morale One instructor stated that it was his opinion as many as 60% of recruit graduates should not graduate . . . instructors are not allowed to fail or expel recruits who did not meet standards. Instructors are told to motivate those recruits who refuse to perform. Instructors are not supposed to verbally abuse trainees. Gender integrated training appears to be contributor in the decline in military training and standards. The military accepts pregnancy as an ""acceptable readiness problem."" Each year between 10% - 17% of women military personnel become pregnant BUT, depending upon other factors that number may be significantly higher. Do women bear any burden or obligation to live up to their contractual agreement with the military; i.e., should pregnancy be a valid excuse to leave their military obligation unfulfilled? What burden does a pregnant military person leave upon others due to her absence? Approximately 50% of all pregnant military females never return to their crews. Female military personnel who served in Desert Storm and were sent home due to pregnancy were still allowed to wear a combat patch on their right sleeve and were awarded the Southwest Asia Service Medal even though they had avoided combat and served in Saudi Arabia for only a few weeks. Instructors refuse to speak to women unless there is another woman present for fear of sexual harassment charges nor are male trainees allowed solitary conversations with another female trainee. Each must be accompanied by a battle-buddy as a witness. Physical Fitness Facts - Gender Studies(The Erosion of Military Effectiveness) Women possess approximately half the strength of a comparable height/weight male. Women have 30% less aerobic capacity. Carrier Theodore Roosevelt: 45 of 300 women did not deploy or complete the cruise due to pregnancy (11 had to be flown off the carrier when underway). Bosnia: 1 pregnancy every 3 days. Women have twice as many sick calls as men. When asked to carry 90 lbs of artillery shells: males failed 20% of the time - females failed 70% of the time. When asked to march 12.5 miles while carrying 60 lbs of equipment followed by target practice: males failed 17% while females failed 48%. Fort Jackson (Army) reports the frequency of lower body injuries among females (hip, knee, back sprains, broken ankles, etc.) is a serious problem. Also, each is accompanied by a battle-buddy during their convalescent time. Previous 1-man jobs have had to be reassigned as 2-man jobs since single females are incapable of performing such jobs alone. More weight had to be assigned to map reading and first aid so as to so that women would not fail in such high numbers. The percentage of women soldiers being medically non-available at any time literally twice that of male soldiers. 1988 - 51% of single Air Force women stationed in Iceland became pregnant. 1988 - 48% of single Navy women stationed in Iceland became pregnant. Bosnia, December 1995 - July 1996: a female military person had to be evacuated due to pregnancy every 3 days. Natick, MA military laboratory study of women between ages of 18-35 who met normal physical standards for Army entry, including height/weight: women suffered 3 times overall injury rate AND twice the incidence of stress fractures in military training environment. 1982-1983 Military Study of 970 advanced graduates (completed boot camp): showed that all men could meet heavy lifting requirements whereas fewer than 15% of women could meet the same standards. Yet, many women are assigned heavy lifting status MOS (military occupational specialty). Hospitalization rate of females is more than 10 times that of men with white females being more than 15 times that of the Army overall. Women have a significantly higher rate of attrition AND women are not as profitable to train due to normal gender differences, injuries, pregnancies, etc. Marine Corps discovered: Only 45% of female Marines could toss a hand grenade beyond its burst radius; i.e., women can't throw a hand grenade far enough to keep from blowing themselves up. Only 12% of female Army recruits could throw a hand grenade beyond its burst radius. Only 12% of Navy females can accomplish a 2-person stretcher carry. Women can not change a truck tire without a man's assistance. Women can fire field artillery pieces BUT they are incapable of handling the ammunition West Point Military Academy: Due to gender norming schemes Women receive A grades for the same performance that earns a male a D Women perform 11% fewer sit-ups Women perform 53% fewer push-ups Women run 1.5 miles 27% slower than males Lt. Kara Hultgren, U.S. Navy pilot killed October 1994 while trying to land her Tomcat fighter plane On approach to the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln, Hultgren made 5 major errors. Major Hultgren ignored repeated wave-off signals by the ships landing officer. Major Hultgrens F-14As left engine subsequently stalled, sending the plane out of control. (Hultgren mistakenly jammed the rudder) No Navy pilot had ever stalled an engine in this manner before. Major Hultgren had subpar performance during several phases of her pilot training. Major Hultgren had four downs (major errors) during her pilot training. Historically, two downs would have been sufficient cause to dismiss a male pilot trainee. The White House and Congress put political pressure to ensure more female combat pilots. During Major Hultgrens final training flying session crashed her plane into the sea while attempting to land on an aircraft carrier. Another female pilot trainee was allowed seven downs of which the last two were not even recorded on her personal record so as to ensure her graduation from pilot training. Double standards dumb-down all pilot training. Double standards undermine military morale and respect. Lt. Carey Lohrenz After Hultgrens death, Lohrenz was dismissed from further aviation training after her flying performance was described by her instructors as unsafe, undisciplined, and unpredictable. Instructors described Lohrenz as engaging in ahigh and fast landing technique, which scared everyone but her. Lohrenz has filed a lawsuit against the Center for Military Readiness (CMR) and Elaine Donnely (head of CMR) regarding her (Lohrenzs) dismissal from aviator school. Lohrenz alleges that the ensuing news stories about Hultgren caused her to lose confidence in her flying abilities and caused her colleagues to scorn her. It should be noted that the CMR report never identified Lohrenz by name. The CMR report referred to Lohrenz as pilot B. It was later articles by the news media that identified Lohrenz by name. Lohrenz has subsequently named two newspapers in the lawsuit. The military conceded to Lohrenz; i.e., the Navy reinstated Lohrenz as a land based pilot. Elaine Donnelly says that this concession to Lohrenz overruled the first-hand judgments of a long line of instructors and superiors in the Pacific chain of command. Ok, maybe more than a FEW facts, but all ones that one should be aware of when deciding if women belong in combat. Quite plainly if someone can't throw a grenade out of the blast radius, is that someone you want standing next to you???","women-combat","02:37 AM","government-debates","72"

But few of them are really applicable given that those of us advocating women in combat unamimously agree that it should only happen if the females in question meet the physical standards required for males to enter combat. i.e. If you can't throw a grenade far enough, you don't get in, just to point out an example from your post.","women-combat","04:22 AM","government-debates","73"

I would suggest that when women join, part of the contract they must sign includes an abortion if they get pregnant, so they are warned beforehand that if they do get pregnant they will be forced to have an abortion.
