Meaning, there aren't all-men platoons or all-women platoons. That presents a moral problem. It just isn't a good idea. On the other software, the point about women POWs was brought up. That is something that I never had thought of, but it certainly is food for thought. American pointed out on the other software that the nations we are likely to be fighting with in the near future are Islamic by nature. He gave the example of how we lost many a good man because their opponents wouldn't surrender to a woman. Not to mention what our Islamic allies would think of having a woman commander equal or greater in rank to them.

"02-05-2003","125",1,"None","None","None","Patriot","1057","Ok. First of all I'll withdraw the first statement of my first post for the time being. I thank falling and thistownwilleat for watching my tail, so to speak, LOL!! :D Point well taken guys. Of course men weren't created to kill. So I'll leave that aspect out for now. How about my other points? Frankly, one should NEVER change anything in one's method of defense unless it improves the mission... I submit that allowing women in combat does NOT improve the mission. It complicates it, and I don't believe that is an idle statement. Ask our Armed Forces if it doesn't complicate things. I know that right now we can afford to degrade the armed forces to some extent, but that is a common peacetime deception. While not fighting we should concentrate on being ready, not catering to the ideas of a special interest group. Not so long ago a survey of our women in uniform was conducted. A great majority of enlisted-grade females said they would refuse a combat assignment! (a smaller percentage of women officers said the same thing.) It's ok to be in the military in peacetime, the military's a free ride! But then in wartime, they want out. Not that I blame them. But this cannot be what we rely on for the security of our nation and it's interests. I will also point out that having women in the military actually serves as a ""deterrant factor""... not a military one mind you, but a deterrant to signing up. Recruiters are having a hard time meeting quotas in all branches, and young men are electing to not go into the Service because of the admission of women. I speak from experience. That 1 of 2 major reasons why I chose to not join up. The correct question is, ""WHY should we allow women in combat?""","women-combat","07:16 PM","government-debates","7"

YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS IN THE MILITARY, except for those they choose to give you. YOU ARE GOVERNMENT PROPERTY. They can basically do whatever they want with you. By all your reasoning, we should let disabled people fight to. Heck, some of them might make it. The idea is it's easier to generalize then to cater to each individual. The military is not a collection of individuals. The military is an ""army of one"" who moves and is supposed to act as one. The military is an organization that strives to eliminate individuality. Since you people think that affirmative action in the case of women in the military is bad, what should the military do instead? Remember, lots of time and money is wasted by catering to individuals.

"02-16-2003","125",2,"None","None","None","American","2354","If any of a woman wishes to risk her own life she may, but when she put the life of another in undo danger because of your choice that is a problem. There are two major drawbacks to putting women in combat situations: First. A man in the trenches can look left and right at other men, shake their hands, and say ""You cover my back and I'll cover yours"" and without thinking twice about it step out into the battle fray. But you put a woman in the mix and you instantly deprive the group of its ability to perform at full capability. When a woman is present in a combat situation it is a natural instinct in men to protect her, even if it costs them their own lives. Therefore by placing women in a combat situation you not only endanger her life, you also unnecessarily endanger the lives of the men around her. Second. If a woman were to join the military right now, and be deployed to Iraq, she would again be placing the people around her in undo danger, simply by her presence. Islamic nationalists predominantly populate Iraq, and as such they will not surrender to a woman. We saw in the Gulf War that because of the presence of women in the trenches the enemy refused to surrender, and we lost ""many a good man."" I agree that [i]f we have another soldier out there who is metally and physically capable of serving this country it is a plus [sic], but I do not believe that it is a plus if that soldier unnecessarily endangers the lives of the others out there. If you want to complain about equal rights go ahead, but I am not going to sit silently by and watch the death toll or our armed forces rise because yall say that equal rights are more valuable than human life. As I said in another post (on the old site), I do not question your patriotism or dedication to our great nation, but I have a problem with someone who wants to use war for their personal gratificationI am not against women fighting, but fight in the air, on the home front, or a vast number of other arenas.

Were any of you actually IN the military? I'm a woman, and I served my time in the military in my early 20s. The physical requirements of the APFT (even for men) were pathetic. You had to be seriously out of shape not to make them. It's not as hard as some of these people would have you believe. MANY women can qualify using the male tables. As for not being able to concentrate when you have women in your unit, well that's the sort of thing that will change with change. Fighting alongside a woman will force these men to let go of their sexist, degrading opinions of women as helpless babymakers who need to be protected because they're too fragile to care for themselves. Yes, there will be some internal problems when women join the fighting forces in full numbers. The sociological ramifications will be a good thing rather than a bad thing. Men will learn to change their outdated thinking. As for arabs not surrendering to women, well the current conflict has taught us otherwise. Arabs are surrendering to units with female apache pilots (who are using the loudspeakers, so don't say the arabs don't know) in droves.

When I say ""yet"" it does not mean that I am ""like 15 years old."" Your assessment that I don't know any women beyond my family and teachers is.... interesting. Yes, you can make a blanket statement and say ""men"" when refering to the people who oppose women in combat, but such an assessment is far from just. By your reasoing, I may say ""the poor"" when I refer to those who break the law, because arguably, the poor commit more crimes than the rich. I'm thinking of conducting such a survey that you advise (in regards to why the females I mentioned oppose women in combat.) I would suggest you do the same. Next: about the draft. You say the draft has been abolished. In that case, why did I have to send in a Selective Service card on my 18th birthday? Obviously, so if there was ever a need, the draft could be reinstituted. So while our armed forces are all-volunteer today, that could change if we fight a major war. You also submit that the women volunteering for combat and drafting women for combat are 2 different things. Maybe so, but allowing women in combat is a step down the road to drafting them for the same purpose. You may argue, but if women weren't allowed to volunteer for combat, they'd never be able to be drafted. I would like to point out I am not saying that women shouldn't serve in the military AT ALL... I'm opposing it in the area of combat. You can serve your country more than adequately in a non-combat role. I also think you misunderstand my opinion of women. I do not think that women are ""inferior"" but they were created different. Just like a screwdriver is different from a hammer. Niether one is inferior to the other, and with some difficulty, you can even get them to do each other's job (I've done it myself).

I don't think that just because we are women that we are ""inferior"" and can't perform the same way. I don't think that just because we are women, we should be allowed into the military for a limited purpose. It sounds to me that some of these guys think that we should be pregnant, and walking around the kitchen in our bare feet. I don't think so! If we meet the same standards and can perform the same duties efficiently, then why the hell can't we serve our country right beside them? As for me, I am in the military, and during training, the females were held to the same physical standards as the males. We met the same standards and passed the same tests and can perform our duties just as well, if not better, than any male. This country, The United States of America, is my country. I will fight for it to the best of my ability. I am willing to give my life for my country, that is why I signed that dotted line. Not for any of that ""equal rights"" XXXX!!

Because I haven't served. On the other hand, if I read what people who have been in the service have said, and spoken to them personally, than we can continue. Those are my sources. In relation to the survey you suggested... are you saying that your findings that tell what most women think about combat service and the draft came from women in the military? You say, ""You still register for selective service because the government likes to be able to keep track of adult men."" Keep track of them for what? For the DRAFT. That's what selective service is all about. Next, when I say I'm not saying they are inferior, just different, you say: ""Of course you're not. You'd like the wimminfolk around to clean up after and feed the men in this real man's army! Gotta let them in the military for that, right?? They can serve their country by cooking and cleaning and playing nurse!"" All this belies your own military experience, during which you came into contact with more non-combatants than just those who ""cook[ed] clean[ed] and play[ed] nurse."" As to your examples of women currently in combat. I'm afraid I cannot take the ""wars"" we've had since integration as an acid test. Even the current conflict is pretty easy, you have to admit. The average Iraqi infantryman is no match for an average American anybody. All this doesn't mean that women aren't functioning well. I believe the problem (with women in combat) is deeper than that.

Here is a quote from a Marine who posted on the old site: ""Women in the military? yes. Women in front-line combat? no. I do not want to sound sexist or anything, but just the logistics of it are overwhelming. Face it: women have certain..er... biological differances that make combat impractical. Supporting women in the field would take lots of time and money. Not to mention that being surrounded by young, horny men constantly would lead to certain....complications not found in current front line units. But don't get me wrong, if I'm in a fighting hole, I want the person next to me to be able to shoot as well as possible, I just don't want the distraction of it being a female."" A quote from Anita Blair, chairman of the Congressional Commission on Military Training and Gender-Related Issues in 1994: ""As a result of my work on the commission, I became convinced that the objective for many who advocate a greater female influence in the armed services isnot so much to conquer the military as conquer manhood: They aim to mak the most quintessentially masculine of our institutions more feminine."" I concur. In a previous post you asked why I thought men made better soldiers than women. I replied, ""Why do I think that men make better soldiers than women? I believe the military is STILL over 50% male!"" THAT is the ""relevance of that little factoid."" Now for your questions: 1) Are there any military jobs for which men are unsuited or incapable of performing? I'll say there aren't any. 2) Are there any military jobs for which women are unsuited or incapable of performing? I don't think that it's accurate to say they are incapable for the most part. However, women shouldn't be a part of ""direct combat."" I still say they are different not equal. You only gave me the military to choose from.

There are distinct physical differences between men and women. ( I hope we can at least agree on this point.) There are also distinct mental differences between men and women. I oppose women in combat for: 1) psychological reasons 2) physical reasons 3) moral reasons 4) religious reasons Psychologically, the majority of men are better able to take on antagonistic forces than women are. The morale of men is much easier to keep up than that of women. Physically, the majority of men have more strength and endurance than women do. Morally, it is wrong to have men and women use the same sleeping, washing, and living facilities. I believe that there are same-sex barracks, but I don't know that it is the general rule. Does anybody know? Also women going into combat face the possibility of becoming POWs. If men are treated cruelly as POW's, just imagine how a woman would be treated. Remember that women are not held in very high regard or with any respect in many countries of the world. Speaking from a religious point of view, men are leaders and protectors. Women help men to be more effective in everything that they do. This in no way implies that women are inferior beings. Men and women have different roles. The issue is not whether women are capable of being in the military or capable of fighting. The issue is whether or not it is a good idea to make an exception to the rule. Should we allow women in the military because some women meet all the physical and mental requirements to join? I would say no, because it is not a job that women should do. Maybe they are capable, but they shouldn't, because when women become just like men and act just like men then all the refinery and femininity tend to go out the window. These niceties of life are what make life more pleasant. The point is, is that men and women ARE ""different"". Hence, we are better suited mentally and physically for ""different"" occupations. Note: In many of my statements I refer to a general rule and not the exception. Keep in mind that there are always exceptions. However, I do not believe in ""rule by a few"", even though I am afraid this very often happens.","women-combat","06:03 PM","government-debates","62"

""1) Males are more aggressive than females in all human societies for which evidence is available. 2) The sex differences are found early in life, at a time when there is no evidence that differential socialization pressures have been brought to bear by adults to ""shape"" aggression differently in the two sexes. 3) Similar sex differences are found in man and subhuman primates. 4) Aggression is related to levels of sex hormones, and can be changed by experimental administration of these hormones. You say that all recorded wars had women POW's. Can you please show me evidence that shows women were POW's from every recorded war in history as a result of deliberately going out and fighting in combat. ""Christian beliefs have no place in government. Principles such as The Golden Rule that Christianity was founded upon certainly have a place, but they existed before Christianity existed, and as such are irrelevant. Read your constitution. Using religious beliefs as a way of establishing doctrine in the military is expressly forbidden, and as such completely invalidates the point you made above."" First of all, Christianity was not founded upon the Golden Rule. It was founded upon Jesus Christ. (By the way, where is the Golden Rule found?) The point about the roles of men and women really is not wholly related to religion. It really is a fact. Your response to it really depends on your worldview. About different occupations for men and women and which are suitable, I don't want to go there. Why, because it wouldn't make any difference. Either I would be written off as having ""oppressive attitudes toward women"" or just an old-fashioned fuddy-duddy who has to be enlightened to the greatness that feminists have done to free women. However, I will tell you something about the occupations of women. Women should not be in the military, if they are married and have children they should not be in the public workplace, and if they are not married, they need to judge for themselves the wisdom of having a job in the public workplace.","women-combat","11:47 AM","government-debates","64"

One more thing though...even though this belongs in the religion debates... Jesus Christ existed long before he deigned to come to earth in human form. He was there at the beginning of the world. And quite frankly I am more willing to accept what He has to say on the subject than some scientist of today who was not there. However, that belongs in the Evolution v. Creationism debate. :D The Bible was written over a period of many centuries and its unity quite clearly speaks for itself. It is true that the Golden Rule is an important principle of Christianity.

Center for Strategic & International Studies found that 66% of junior enlisted men did not believe that women could pull their own weight. 44% of junior enlisted women agreed !! DACOWITS (Defense Advisory Commission on Women in the Services): a mostly civilian advisory panel; established 50 years ago to advise the Pentagon on military matters pertaining to women. One female Marine complained that the 3-mile morning run was demeaning to women. The run had to be suspended pending an investigation. Military Morale One instructor stated that it was his opinion as many as 60% of recruit graduates should not graduate . . . instructors are not allowed to fail or expel recruits who did not meet standards. Instructors are told to motivate those recruits who refuse to perform. Instructors are not supposed to verbally abuse trainees. Gender integrated training appears to be contributor in the decline in military training and standards. The military accepts pregnancy as an ""acceptable readiness problem."" Each year between 10% - 17% of women military personnel become pregnant BUT, depending upon other factors that number may be significantly higher. Do women bear any burden or obligation to live up to their contractual agreement with the military; i.e., should pregnancy be a valid excuse to leave their military obligation unfulfilled? What burden does a pregnant military person leave upon others due to her absence? Approximately 50% of all pregnant military females never return to their crews. Female military personnel who served in Desert Storm and were sent home due to pregnancy were still allowed to wear a combat patch on their right sleeve and were awarded the Southwest Asia Service Medal even though they had avoided combat and served in Saudi Arabia for only a few weeks. Instructors refuse to speak to women unless there is another woman present for fear of sexual harassment charges nor are male trainees allowed solitary conversations with another female trainee. Each must be accompanied by a battle-buddy as a witness. Physical Fitness Facts - Gender Studies(The Erosion of Military Effectiveness) Women possess approximately half the strength of a comparable height/weight male. Women have 30% less aerobic capacity. Carrier Theodore Roosevelt: 45 of 300 women did not deploy or complete the cruise due to pregnancy (11 had to be flown off the carrier when underway). Bosnia: 1 pregnancy every 3 days. Women have twice as many sick calls as men. When asked to carry 90 lbs of artillery shells: males failed 20% of the time - females failed 70% of the time. When asked to march 12.5 miles while carrying 60 lbs of equipment followed by target practice: males failed 17% while females failed 48%. Fort Jackson (Army) reports the frequency of lower body injuries among females (hip, knee, back sprains, broken ankles, etc.) is a serious problem. Also, each is accompanied by a battle-buddy during their convalescent time. Previous 1-man jobs have had to be reassigned as 2-man jobs since single females are incapable of performing such jobs alone. More weight had to be assigned to map reading and first aid so as to so that women would not fail in such high numbers. The percentage of women soldiers being medically non-available at any time literally twice that of male soldiers. 1988 - 51% of single Air Force women stationed in Iceland became pregnant. 1988 - 48% of single Navy women stationed in Iceland became pregnant. Bosnia, December 1995 - July 1996: a female military person had to be evacuated due to pregnancy every 3 days. Natick, MA military laboratory study of women between ages of 18-35 who met normal physical standards for Army entry, including height/weight: women suffered 3 times overall injury rate AND twice the incidence of stress fractures in military training environment. 1982-1983 Military Study of 970 advanced graduates (completed boot camp): showed that all men could meet heavy lifting requirements whereas fewer than 15% of women could meet the same standards. Yet, many women are assigned heavy lifting status MOS (military occupational specialty). Hospitalization rate of females is more than 10 times that of men with white females being more than 15 times that of the Army overall. Women have a significantly higher rate of attrition AND women are not as profitable to train due to normal gender differences, injuries, pregnancies, etc. Marine Corps discovered: Only 45% of female Marines could toss a hand grenade beyond its burst radius; i.e., women can't throw a hand grenade far enough to keep from blowing themselves up. Only 12% of female Army recruits could throw a hand grenade beyond its burst radius. Only 12% of Navy females can accomplish a 2-person stretcher carry. Women can not change a truck tire without a man's assistance. Women can fire field artillery pieces BUT they are incapable of handling the ammunition West Point Military Academy: Due to gender norming schemes Women receive A grades for the same performance that earns a male a D Women perform 11% fewer sit-ups Women perform 53% fewer push-ups Women run 1.5 miles 27% slower than males Lt. Kara Hultgren, U.S. Navy pilot killed October 1994 while trying to land her Tomcat fighter plane On approach to the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln, Hultgren made 5 major errors. Major Hultgren ignored repeated wave-off signals by the ships landing officer. Major Hultgrens F-14As left engine subsequently stalled, sending the plane out of control. (Hultgren mistakenly jammed the rudder) No Navy pilot had ever stalled an engine in this manner before. Major Hultgren had subpar performance during several phases of her pilot training. Major Hultgren had four downs (major errors) during her pilot training. Historically, two downs would have been sufficient cause to dismiss a male pilot trainee. The White House and Congress put political pressure to ensure more female combat pilots. During Major Hultgrens final training flying session crashed her plane into the sea while attempting to land on an aircraft carrier. Another female pilot trainee was allowed seven downs of which the last two were not even recorded on her personal record so as to ensure her graduation from pilot training. Double standards dumb-down all pilot training. Double standards undermine military morale and respect. Lt. Carey Lohrenz After Hultgrens death, Lohrenz was dismissed from further aviation training after her flying performance was described by her instructors as unsafe, undisciplined, and unpredictable. Instructors described Lohrenz as engaging in ahigh and fast landing technique, which scared everyone but her. Lohrenz has filed a lawsuit against the Center for Military Readiness (CMR) and Elaine Donnely (head of CMR) regarding her (Lohrenzs) dismissal from aviator school. Lohrenz alleges that the ensuing news stories about Hultgren caused her to lose confidence in her flying abilities and caused her colleagues to scorn her. It should be noted that the CMR report never identified Lohrenz by name. The CMR report referred to Lohrenz as pilot B. It was later articles by the news media that identified Lohrenz by name. Lohrenz has subsequently named two newspapers in the lawsuit. The military conceded to Lohrenz; i.e., the Navy reinstated Lohrenz as a land based pilot. Elaine Donnelly says that this concession to Lohrenz overruled the first-hand judgments of a long line of instructors and superiors in the Pacific chain of command. Ok, maybe more than a FEW facts, but all ones that one should be aware of when deciding if women belong in combat.

I can see the main arguements are coming from Patriot, and Silver as well as a few others. I'm with Silver for the most part. I'm 18, I'm female, I took the ASVAB and got a rather... HIGH score on it for what it means. (dunno if I can release that.. better not) I meet all of the physical requirements... and I'm now enlisted in the Marines. I took the test with mostly guys... and somehow managed to surpass the majority. Am I not qualified? I handle myself well in emergency situations. I'm very mentally alert. It's also been proven that women can concentrate on more things at once than guys can, for what that's worth. I signed that line for several reasons. I want to serve this country and give back what it has given me, if necessary. And what the hell, there are some guys out there who aren't qualified to, or simply won't. To Put it simply. Some men don't qualify, and some women do. My recruiter was a male. He seemed to have no problem with me being female and wasn't phased the least. Neither were all the other males that were with me when we were sworn in. I don't know why people on the field would feel any different. Then again, I don't have that experince. Help me out there, Silver. heh. As for male's protective instincts or whatever... what about female's protective instincts. Aren't they noted for being the more protective parent. Or maybe I was taught wrong. Whatever And seriously, how much of that protective instinct is going to be directed at just a female, rather than the rest of the fighters on the field? Are men just not strong enough to overcome that instinct and do his job? (Ok, that sounded really sexist, and I'm sorry, but it's a point) His job is to protect his country and fellow fighters, not a specific one. So then do the job. I'm beginning to convince myself that I'm really biased. wow. I'm just typing my thoughts though. These are questions I was never presented with before and got me thinking. I like that. Anyway, another reason I joined was because of family history. Many of my relatives (both male and female) were in the military, and when asked, say they wouldn't trade it for the world. I'm doing it because I want to make something of myself, my wheels are spinning, I'm not challenged, and I need something to motivate my life. What's better than serving my country? I also joined because even though I'm young, I know that wealth doesn't come in the form of money, it comes in the form of experince. Everyone I've talked to that's been in the military say that they now have a completely new, better outlook on life. I want that. I guess I think the services are just the way to go if you want a worthwhile experience. (once again, Silver, help me out there... is that anywhere near the truth?) So it's not just about fighting to me. It's about serving, it's about knowledge, it's about experience, and it's about pride (and I don't mean being conceited). So then why can't I join the Military? I'm not in it for that equal rights XXXX. I know many females (and yes, they do outnumber the males, but that's because society has shaped them to be so) that are NOT qualified. I am. So should I waste that qualification? I think I could do the country a service (and NOT hinder them... ) and I am determined to do so.","women-combat","12:55 AM","government-debates","89"
