My Bible teacher says if they draft his daughters he would protest with all the other angry fathers. but then he said if they go on there own will then thats a different story. Anyways, do yall believe in women in combat? I think we should be able to.","women-combat","10:05 PM","government-debates","1"
"02-05-2003","125",1,"None","None","None","Patriot","996","I'm against women in combat, for many reasons. For instance, women in combat aren't segregated. Meaning, there aren't all-men platoons or all-women platoons. That presents a moral problem. It just isn't a good idea. On the other software, the point about women POWs was brought up. That is something that I never had thought of, but it certainly is food for thought. American pointed out on the other software that the nations we are likely to be fighting with in the near future are Islamic by nature. He gave the example of how we lost many a good man because their opponents wouldn't surrender to a woman. Not to mention what our Islamic allies would think of having a woman commander equal or greater in rank to them. Edited to remove stupid statement.","women-combat","11:27 AM","government-debates","2"

"02-05-2003","125",1,"None","None","None","Patriot","1057","Ok. First of all I'll withdraw the first statement of my first post for the time being. I thank falling and thistownwilleat for watching my tail, so to speak, LOL!! :D Point well taken guys. Of course men weren't created to kill. So I'll leave that aspect out for now. How about my other points? Frankly, one should NEVER change anything in one's method of defense unless it improves the mission... I submit that allowing women in combat does NOT improve the mission. It complicates it, and I don't believe that is an idle statement. Ask our Armed Forces if it doesn't complicate things. I know that right now we can afford to degrade the armed forces to some extent, but that is a common peacetime deception. While not fighting we should concentrate on being ready, not catering to the ideas of a special interest group. Not so long ago a survey of our women in uniform was conducted. A great majority of enlisted-grade females said they would refuse a combat assignment! (a smaller percentage of women officers said the same thing.) It's ok to be in the military in peacetime, the military's a free ride! But then in wartime, they want out. Not that I blame them. But this cannot be what we rely on for the security of our nation and it's interests. I will also point out that having women in the military actually serves as a ""deterrant factor""... not a military one mind you, but a deterrant to signing up. Recruiters are having a hard time meeting quotas in all branches, and young men are electing to not go into the Service because of the admission of women. I speak from experience. That 1 of 2 major reasons why I chose to not join up. The correct question is, ""WHY should we allow women in combat?""","women-combat","07:16 PM","government-debates","7"

"02-15-2003","125",1,"None","None","None","Patriot","2175","the standards have been lowered. The military is told: ""Ok, you HAVE to pass this many women."" to do that, they have to lower teh standards or be accused of being ""sexist"" for not admiting enough women. If you hang on a while, I'll do some research and get some statistics. who said anything about equal rights? falling, why don't you create a thread about equal rights and you and I will define what equal rights means.","women-combat","02:25 PM","government-debates","12"
"02-15-2003","125",1,"None","None","None","fallingupwards","2178","if you dont allow ANY women in the military at all, then you do NOT believe in equal rights. i am not calling for affirmative action. i am calling for women to be ALLOWED to be in the military. you do not believe a woman should be allowed to fight in the military, even if they are as capable or more capable than other men. therefore, you do not believe in equal rights...along with all of your conservative friends.","women-combat","02:49 PM","government-debates","13"
"02-15-2003","125",1,"None","None","None","Calligirl","2203","Wait just a minute here... I am a conservative and I believe that women should be allowed to fight in wars. Falling, can you please stop generalizing and saying ""all conservatives"" believe this and ""all conservatives"" believe that...? I do believe, however, that it is true that the standards have been lowered for women to get into the army, millitary, etc. If women should be allowed to fight, they need to be able to fight just as well as any other man. Lowering the standards for the ""weaker gender"" is simply degrading.","women-combat","04:46 PM","government-debates","14"
