YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS IN THE MILITARY, except for those they choose to give you. YOU ARE GOVERNMENT PROPERTY. They can basically do whatever they want with you. By all your reasoning, we should let disabled people fight to. Heck, some of them might make it. The idea is it's easier to generalize then to cater to each individual. The military is not a collection of individuals. The military is an ""army of one"" who moves and is supposed to act as one. The military is an organization that strives to eliminate individuality. Since you people think that affirmative action in the case of women in the military is bad, what should the military do instead? Remember, lots of time and money is wasted by catering to individuals. In this case, it's easier to lower the standards so they can comply with the rules politicians have imposed on them.","women-combat","07:15 PM","government-debates","16"

Patriot, I believe your doing this with a good heart but you got to realize it doesn't matter male or female. We are doing it because we love our country, just like males do. As Sarablaze said if we got got another soilder out there, then its a plus.","women-combat","10:35 PM","government-debates","21"

There are two major drawbacks to putting women in combat situations: First. A man in the trenches can look left and right at other men, shake their hands, and say ""You cover my back and I'll cover yours"" and without thinking twice about it step out into the battle fray. But you put a woman in the mix and you instantly deprive the group of its ability to perform at full capability. When a woman is present in a combat situation it is a natural instinct in men to protect her, even if it costs them their own lives. Therefore by placing women in a combat situation you not only endanger her life, you also unnecessarily endanger the lives of the men around her. Second. If a woman were to join the military right now, and be deployed to Iraq, she would again be placing the people around her in undo danger, simply by her presence. Islamic nationalists predominantly populate Iraq, and as such they will not surrender to a woman. We saw in the Gulf War that because of the presence of women in the trenches the enemy refused to surrender, and we lost ""many a good man."" I agree that [i]f we have another soldier out there who is metally and physically capable of serving this country it is a plus [sic], but I do not believe that it is a plus if that soldier unnecessarily endangers the lives of the others out there. If you want to complain about equal rights go ahead, but I am not going to sit silently by and watch the death toll or our armed forces rise because yall say that equal rights are more valuable than human life. As I said in another post (on the old site), I do not question your patriotism or dedication to our great nation, but I have a problem with someone who wants to use war for their personal gratificationI am not against women fighting, but fight in the air, on the home front, or a vast number of other arenas. Not in ground combat, it needlessly costs too many lives.","women-combat","05:59 PM","government-debates","22"

Now if it were a man standing next to me a would be angry, but I would not be blaming myself because of his death. You get my point yet?","women-combat","11:16 PM","government-debates","25"

If they meet the same physical requirement for frontline combat troops, let them at it. Women are capable or even more capable of violence. Think of a woman that has been cheated on, or woman defending a infant baby. Do you think any of these women are not capable of ruthless violence? Serving in the women military should not be about rights. It should be about combat readiness. It they help in raising combat readiness, then they should.","women-combat","11:36 PM","government-debates","26"
