"05-27-2005","5346",3,"Symbiote","None","And, you also prefer the meal to the $5 itself. The $5 has an existence independent of the things you might buy with it, it is the paper in your wallet, the balance in your account. It can be burned, held for later use, etc. You can indeed prefer not to buy the meal, even though the meal is the best thing you can buy for $5, because you prefer to save the money. You may value the $5 itself more than anything you can buy with it - people frequently do. But why? Isn't it conceivable that a faster or slower rate of change than the general historical trend could decrease rates of misuse?","Nurglitch","129268","Sure, but the value of it is determined by its relation to all of my other preferences to it. The money itself is merely an abstract token of those values. Any 'reality' that the prices have is merely a social convention. It may be a fact that a meal costs $5, but what a meal is and what $5 is are defined culturally through convention and use. Yes, I can do stupid and irrational things with that money, such as saving it like a miser instead of satisfying my pre-eminent interests in a meal. The fact that people make this mistake is simply an example of human error, and not of value. Maybe it's conceivable on some other model of culture, but in this one the increase or decrease in the rate of change interferes with the development of a stable culture. It's a value-neutral approach insofar as what people do with that culture, and harm to that culture simply makes its use more difficult and less effective.","logic-war-drugs","11:35 AM","government-debates","32"
"05-27-2005","5346",3,"Symbiote","None","If I were to speak to the miser - he would say your decision to spend was irrational. The hoarding of money confers vastly greater benefits than the spending of it, the prestige of being wealthy - the ability to swim in a vault - ensuring that you have something to do on a rainy day. Money is an actual thing, that can in itself be possessed, transferred, held, burned, worshipped or shunned. The neoclassical economists do like to abstract it away, but this is a convenience on their part for the sake of their ""models"". It is not an ""abstract token"", it is a real token, just like a tooth, a shiny piece of gold, a rock or an apple.","Nurglitch","129380","Then the miser would be an idiot. After all, if I said that 2+2=4 and the miser claimed 2+2=5, then supposing that we are using the same numerals to denote the same values, he would be wrong and I would be right. Similarly if the miser thought that I was being irrational because I bought a meal with my $5 when I valued the meal more than having the $5 or anything else I could have for the trade of $5, then he would be wrong in stating that my action was irrational. He would be confusing the fact that he prefers to have $5 with my preference to have a meal. I think you're confusing the value of something with the objects used to represent those values. Just my opinion though. Oh, a coin or a bill or some electronically encoded data is definitely a thing. What those things represent is another matter, I think.","logic-war-drugs","02:26 PM","government-debates","34"
"05-28-2005","5346",3,"Symbiote","None","Well yes, just as you would be wrong in stating the action of a miser, who actually did prefer the $5 to anything he could buy with it, was irrational when he hoarded all his money.","Nurglitch","129599","Ah, that's where I'd disagree. I think that we can say objective things about the rationality of actions, and that the rationality of actions is something objective that we can say objective things about. Can't say I buy into the whole axiological relativism bit, especially when it deals with rationality. What is objectively rational to do is to satisfy your own best interests. You may not know what your own best interests are, and you may be mistaken about them, but to satisfy them is rational. Although the miser may prefer hoarding money and believe that doing so satisfies his interests, he does so from some failure of rationality. This scenario is much like a heroin addict may prefer heroin and believe that shooting it satisfies his interests. These failures may be the result of undeveloped reasoning, ignorance of relevant values, or some mixture of the two. The fact that the miser has different preferences from me does not infer that values are relative, unless we're using some novel sort of inductive inference. A much more parsimonious explanation would be one of error in opinion, and would be that either he's wrong, or I'm wrong, or we're both wrong.","logic-war-drugs","12:33 AM","government-debates","36"
"05-28-2005","5346",3,"None","None","None","Symbiote","129622","I believe it is implied in the "" is as ultimately satisfying to him"" that we are talking in this case about his ""objective"" interests - that which actually satisfies him. Or do you believe people can be satisfied by fulfilling their ""perceived"" interests - Are you proposing that misers suffer from something like a Marxist ""false consciousness"", where they believe hoarding cash makes them happy, and actually feel satisfaction in hoarding cash, but this masks their ""real"" interests, which lie in gourmet meals and fast cars? Is this what you're putting forward, the idea that someone couldn't really, truly be satisfied by cash hoarding, and that anyone who feels satisfied by it is actually deluded? If so I would contend that there is no distinction between ""feeling satisfied"" and actually, objectively, ""being satisfied"". Being satisfied consists precisely in having the feeling of satisfaction. Certainly a miser may perceive that money will make him happy, hoard money, and then discover he is mistaken - he discovers, too late, that he is not happy at all. The perceived/objective distinction I take to mean during the act and after the act - during the act, people try to satisfy their desires - after the act they discover whether their action actually satisfied their desires or not. Some individuals value some things, some value others, some pursue correct paths of action to satisfy their desires, others' quests turn out to be unsatisfying - but there appears to me nothing about any given value which makes it in itself more rational than another, or more correct to pursue. And yes, this does propose that value is particular to the individual, that no given end is any any ultimate sense ""better"" than any other, it is only better or worse from the perspective of a particular individual - and this is of course deeply problematic from a consequentialist perspective. And yet Mises himself was a utilitarian, he contended that the purpose of economics was to inform people as to whether given actions would satisfy the desires, ie make things better, from the perspective of the person acting .","logic-war-drugs","03:04 AM","government-debates","39"

People like the miser and the heroin addict seem pretty clear-cut cases though, and given the possibility of error it's probably better to err on the side of caution in less clear-cut cases. I thought you might say something like that. Yet there seems to be some sort of difference between saying ""I feel that my preferences are satisfied"" and ""My preferences are satisfied"". The former indicates a perception and the latter indicates an objective state. Taking into account the fact that people can be mistaken about things, the capacity for error, and it seems to me that it's important to differentiate perception from actuality. Y'see, that's what I'm talking about. People can also figure this out in advance, given the right tools, I suggest. Or maybe people have learned from previous mistakes. The way I understand it, is that it is rational to prefer the objectively higher value, and to err on the side of caution when the objectively higher value is unknown. Oh, the perception and recognition of objective values is definitely a problem for consequentialist systems that fail to properly distinguish between individual's perceptions and the objective nature of values. But that's really just another facet of consequentialism's failure as an ethical theory, the fact that it provides no objective or public framework for values, and reduces ethics to prudence as a result. I'll take your word for it, since I haven't read anything by Mises. An economics that merely satisfies the individual's perception of prudence seems to be no basis for public policy though, which seems to be the point of economics in my opinion.","logic-war-drugs","03:12 PM","government-debates","40"
"05-29-2005","5346",3,"Symbiote","None","I did countenance for a while the possibility of objective values, partially due to Ayn Rand's stubbon insistence, although unsupported, that they existed and that she knew them. But it's not what you're talking about at all. I certainly accept that people can take actions they think will satisfy them, for example, completing their collection of dolls - and then once their action is complete, discover they do not feel satisfied, or happy, at all, and that their actions have been misguided. In contrast, we have someone who hoards cash, and then feels satisfied, feels happy, and yet is informed that he is not actually happy, or actually satisfied, that he only possesses the feelings. Certainly there is a distinction here, because the first statement is of a meta-order, like ""I feel like I feel satisfied"", that suggests a degree of doubtfulness. I do not think there is any distinction between ""I am satisfied"" and ""I have the feeling of satisfaction"" at all any more than ""I am happy"" and ""I have the feeling of happiness"". Can a person feel sad but not actually be sad, or vice versa? There's a big deal about economics, as a science, being meant to be wertfrei or value-free. There is a for example, if someone says ""I wish to raise the living standard of the workers - I will increase the minimum wage to $20"", the analysis is built to answer the question ""Will raising the minimum wage raise the living standard of the workers?"". So it doesn't make public policy, but it does act as a guide for the methods it should use to attain the ends sought. If the ruling party said ""I want to impoverish the people of this nation, and to do so we will use the methods of Kim Jong Il and his ancestors"", the only objection that could be laid, from an economic standpoint, would be that there are more efficient methods available of causing impoverishment. And yet what politician declares their desire to make people poorer?","Nurglitch","129990","Purely on the strength of analogy to Wittgenstein's private language argument, I'd say that the only values that exist are public and objective. So the error isn't with their perception but with their action? Ah, there's a point of miscommunication. I'm not claiming that the miser merely perceives himself to be happy and is not actually happy. I'm saying that mere happiness is not sufficient for the miser's actual interests being satisfied. The satisfaction of a desire to be happy is, while understandable, not necessarily what is in your interest. Since the difference specified is between first and second orders, actuality and perception, it doesn't really work to say that the first order is subject to perception. The truth of such a proposition is quite apart from the perception of that truth. I suppose you might ask why I would suggest something like truth independent of perception, being that truth is a conceptual relation. I do so because conceptual relations are not perceptual relations. For example 2+2=4 is true insofar as there is a system of rules and symbols whose mechanical operation produces such a proposition however it is represented. Well, let's take a similar situation then involving the second person. There seems to be a distinction between ""You are satisfied"" and ""I have the feeling you are satisfied"" - the fact that you are satisfied is independent of the observer. Now, suppose it is not your feeling of satisfaction that is at issue, and the proposition that ""I am satisfied"" does not mean ""I feel satisfied"" and instead means ""My interests are satisfied"". Likewise ""I have the feeling my interests are satisfied"". ""My interests are satisfied"" when my interests are indeed satisfied, and ""I have the feeling my interests are satisfied"" when I indeed have the feeling that my interests are satisfied. To recap: I agree with you that perceptions and feelings are subjective and that the truth of any propositions about you having those perceptions and feelings depends on you actually having those perceptions and feelings. I disagree, however, that perceptions and feelings about interests are interests themselves. After all, I am not happy because my interests are satisfied, but I am happy because I think that my interests are satisfied. I may think wrongly about what my interests are and be happy when my actual interests are not satisfied. Likewise I may think wrongly about what my interests are and be unhappy when my actual interests are satisfied. But it cannot be the case that my perception is not my perception, my feelings are not my feelings, or my interests not my interests. Yeah, there is a big deal about science and other tools being supposedly value free. Even when we abstract the values underwriting whatever task we are using said tools for, how we use these tools, or how they are made and maintained, I suggest that we are left with something that is not value-neutral or value-free. If they were value-free, they'd be useless. Unless we want to bog down in circular definitions, some values just need to be assumed in order to go ahead and devise a tool. When people say something is ""value-free"" they usually just mean that its operation may be described by a universally applicable, or 'objective', set of values. Yes, I agree that economics is a tool by which public policy is implemented, but it is also a tool by which public policy is evaluated and measured as well. Much like a stencil defines what may be drawn (printed?), a science of economics defines public policy by framing it in terms of that particular system of economics. If you imagine a system of economics to be like a language according to the framework that Andy Clark suggests in that paper I linked to a while back, then you can see how it mediates our approach to public policy. If you only have a hammer, screws won't be considered for your fastening needs, to abuse another analogy. Any politician that doesn't declare their desire to make people richer, I'd think. I would think that would be the silent rider to all those promises to improve security, get tough on crime, strengthen national unity, or whatever other area that the politician want to expand gov't influence in.","logic-war-drugs","01:44 PM","government-debates","42"
"05-29-2005","5346",3,"Symbiote","None","Yes, but there is no difference between ""You are satisfied"" and ""You have the feeling of satisfaction"". Someone who is satisfied certainly has the feeling of satisfaction, but they may not feel they are satisfied. The examples you are providing discuss feelings of a second order - feelings about whether or not you possess the first order feeling of satisfaction itself. Then why should anyone rational seek to satisfy their actual interests, if they are divorced from enjoyment? They are erroneous in their expectation of what will satisfy their future self - as a result they take actions inappropriate to generating that satisfaction.","Nurglitch","130124","That seems to be question-begging as I understand it. If what you're saying is that ""You are satisfied"" really means ""You have the feeling of satisfaction"", then it seems that ""You have the feeling of satisfaction"" really means ""You have the feeling that you feel satisfaction"". This proposition now seems to really mean: ""You have the feeling that you feel the feeling of satisfaction"". And so on. That's why I tried to suggest we phrase these propositions differently, so that they represent more accurately what I am trying to say. Instead of saying ""I am satisfied"" or some variation, it seems more accurate to say that ""My interests are satisfied."" and ""I am feeling satisfied (1) that my interests are satisfied (3)"" to properly differentiate between the thing to which satisfaction in the first sense pertains and the perception to which satisfaction in the second sense pertains. It might be something to differentiate between the two of the uses of satisfaction to avoid amphiboly, eh? http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=satisfaction Specifically we appear to be dealing with #1 and #3, and #3 is poorly worded so that it seems to imply perception whereas I'm trying to stress a 'satisfaction' in terms of satisfying conditions. They were intended to demonstrate that first order satisfaction is not a feeling in the #1 sense of 'satisfaction'. Let me try again: 1. Suppose that an abstracted set of interests are either satisfied or not according to some scheme of necessary and sufficient conditions such that each normative statement of interests is matched by a state of the world. 2. Suppose further that the state of the world must be interpreted or perceived such that each state of the world may be matched by a descriptive statement. 3. If the descriptive statement derived from perception of the world states appear to match the normative statements defining the interests, then we will feel satisfied by this turn of events because it appears that our interests are satisfied. 4. Therefore regardless of how we fail to satisfy our interests, we may feel satisfaction when our interests are not satisfied. Because the satisfaction of those interests is more important than enjoyment/pleasure/happiness or lack thereof. Again, I think that the feeling of enjoyment/pleasure/happiness may be confused with more abstract utilitarian notions of intellectual enjoyment/pleasure/happiness. So they err when they are mistaken about what will make them feel good in the future?","logic-war-drugs","07:38 PM","government-debates","44"
