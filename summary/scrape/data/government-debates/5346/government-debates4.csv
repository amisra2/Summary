"05-30-2005","5346",4,"Symbiote","None","I am saying, there is no difference between a happy person and a person experiencing the emotion of happiness. I do not see what possible difference there is between someone experiencing an emotion and that person being said to be in that emotional state - being ""happy"" is being in a state of experiencing the feeling of ""happiness"". When I say ""happiness"", read ""abstract utilitarian notions of happiness"". That may be where we are talking past each other.","Nurglitch","130353","Yes, I have pointed out that I agree with that. Indeed, but notice that I've been trying to say that a person's interests and a person's feelings are not the same. A person's perception of their feelings are their feelings. A person's perception of their interests are not their feelings. Good point. Now suppose that ""abstract utilitarian notions of happiness"" may or may not cause feelings of happiness. Better still, ditch the concept of ""abstract utilitarian notions of happiness"" and substitute the concept of ""interests"" as the place-holder for whatever it is that makes someone's action prudent, moral, or otherwise.","logic-war-drugs","12:20 PM","government-debates","46"
"05-30-2005","5346",4,"Symbiote","None","I still don't see how you can possibly declare that no one's real interests can lie in accumulating money, or getting that next hit, it doesn't seem obvious at all to me.","Nurglitch","130367","Pretty easily. You just start typing... Seriously though, I'm arguing that what makes a person happy is not what satisfies their interests. You may be, on this scheme, the happiest person in the world and still have not done anything good or prudent. Ancilliary to that is my claim that no one's interests lie in the endless accumulation of cash (being a miser) or in the next hit (being a drug addict), because miserliness and drug addiction and similar vices work contrary to 'basic' or meta-prudential interests such as the satisfaction of as many interests as possible, the satisfaction of prefered interests first*, and so on. According to how I understand my economic theory of ethics, anyways.","logic-war-drugs","12:42 PM","government-debates","48"
"05-30-2005","5346",4,"None","None","None","Symbiote","130597","Well, the satisfaction of many interests, all else equal, is more likely to be in someone's interest, ie the satisfaction of someone's 57th and 58th preference together should come before either of them individually, but it is very much possible for a single satisfied interest to outweigh dozens or even millions of less important preferences. It's not even particularly meaningful to talk quantitatively about interest - is miserliness an interest, or shall we have one interest for hoarding and another for collecting, or one for each dollar, or penny, accumulated.","logic-war-drugs","11:03 PM","government-debates","49"

Instead of trying to explain them away as permutations in some universal thing called 'interests', you take them as primitive and figure out how they hang together as a system. Depends on how you quantify it. If you quantify the interests atomically you just get arbitrary values. If you quantify these interests, divided however you want, according to their relations to each other, suddenly you have a meaningful, that is objective, way of talking about priority and preference in terms of interests.","logic-war-drugs","01:46 AM","government-debates","50"
"05-31-2005","5346",4,"None","None","None","Symbiote","130638","Any division is arbitrary, and there is no truth in defining interest into groupings, and then asserting that it is objectively good to satisfy interests from as many of these groupings as possible. In any case, people will always act on what they perceive to be their interests, this cannot be held up as irrational. It would be irrational to act contrary to your perceived interests. Even if it is possible to derive actual interests with certainty, which I am doubtful about, the derivation itself is only rationally undertaken when its perceived benefits exceed its perceived opportunity costs.","logic-war-drugs","02:13 AM","government-debates","51"
"06-02-2005","5346",4,"None","None","None","CvT","131758","Wow. I see this thread has been seriously bogged down in philosophical navel-gazing. If I may comment on its original topic, I think the war on drugs is a mistake. Certain substances should be subject to legal controls because of the immediate danger and long-term consequences they represent. That's why we use prescriptions to hand out medication rather than selling them freely to anyone who wants to try something. As much as I find pot smokers annoying, I think they should be able to partake of their particular vice. Regulate it like alcohol (set an age, standarize the ingredients) and let people have at the stuff.","logic-war-drugs","09:14 AM","government-debates","53"

Mostly I look at it as saving us a ton of money in legal and law enforcement expenses for locking up people who want nothing more than to get a little bent. I figure it's only a matter of time before someone figures out how to make dandelions into a drug, and then we're all in trouble.","logic-war-drugs","11:03 AM","government-debates","55"

"06-02-2005","5346",4,"Nurglitch","None","Not really. We've been establishing common ground and sharing ideas on the best way to think about these things. Calling it philosophical navel-gazing is a bit like calling an architect's blue-prints ""doodles"".","Eddie","131899","I actually think it was a form of a compliment. I know, I know, it doesn`t really sound like one, but we are talking about CvT here. I think this is the best you can get Personaly, I find your conversation fascinating. Not that I understand everything, but the parts I do understand are, in lack of a better word, cool...","logic-war-drugs","12:45 PM","government-debates","58"

While not as acrid as cigarette smoke, it's stench can be overpowering. It doesn't help that people try to cover it by burning bundles of incense. The smokers themselves (in my experience) are unhygenic in the extreme. I guess in that respect the billious clouds of smoke are a blessing because they cover up the body odor. Nurglitch: If you can build a highway or building as a result of such banter, good for you. Otherwise it's just so much mumbo-jumbo. In my history classes I was (in)famous for my general dislike of philosophical arguments. I'm reminded of Bill Cosby's routine about how philosophy majors would wander around asking ""Why is there air?"" ""Every Phys Ed major knew why there was air,"" Cosby pointed out. ""There's air to XXXX up volleyballs and basketballs. And people call us dumb.""","logic-war-drugs","02:09 PM","government-debates","59"

All technical subjects require a technical language, and it just so happens that philosophy is about those technical languages and how well they work. Anything that you don't understand the purpose of seems useless. The purpose/use of philosophy is to develop better problem solving strategies. Congradulations. I'm kind of curious as to why you were studying philosophical arguments in history class but that's rather off-topic. It's that kind of stupidity that philosophy is about ameliorating. I remember my introductory philosophy professor pointing out in class that there are stupid questions and that it was quite easy to identify them - they ask questions such as ""Why is there air?"" in non-applicable ways. The first thing you need to ask when answering such a question is what subject that such a question is about - the material compostion of air, the process by which air is produced, or the purpose of air. You can answer that question easily for the first two subjects easily by proposing an ontological and metaphysical scheme that adequately handles our empirical observations of air - by doing natural philosophy (aka: applied science). The third subject is non-applicable because air is a natural object rather than an artifactual object and as such is not something to which questions of purpose or intention apply.","logic-war-drugs","02:55 PM","government-debates","60"
