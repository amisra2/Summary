The War on Drugs is based on the idea that people have no right to harm themselves. This principle, when applied consistently, leads a Christian to conclude that Christianity must be forced on the people, as not being Christian leads to the ultimate harm of damnation. In fact, if someone embraces both Christianity and the logic of the War on Drugs, the prohibition of non-Christianity is in fact much more important than the prohibition of pot, as eternal punishment is much more harmful than a little brain damage. Similarly, some argue that drugs must be prohibited because they cause people to waste their lives. If an atheist embraces this twisted logic, then he must conclude that the government should prohibit all religions, as religions advocate self-denial, encourage people to waste time in worship, and prevent people from living life to the fullest. So, before we embrace the twisted principles behind the War on Drugs, we must consider what they imply when applied consistently. In this case, a consistent application of War on Drugs principles would run up against the Constitution. Of course, the government could continue to hold a logically inconsistent, fence-straddling policy as it currently does with regard to self-ownership. How about consistent principles that don't run up against the Constitution? How about the principle that everyone has the right to live his own life without unwanted interference from others? Or is that too much to ask?","logic-war-drugs","06:32 PM","government-debates","1"

Christianity, or at least the moderate kind that concerns itself with charitable work and community building, doesn't do this. It's an invalid comparison, or as the logicians might say, a false formal identity claim. If you want consistent principles that don't conflict with the American constitution, then you're out of luck. Any set of principles is eventually entail inconsistencies. If you're trying to be functionally consistent with a set of ad hoc principles such as the USA constitution is composed, then you may not like the set of principles you're stuck with. Consistency between principles is nice, but in the 'real world' the effect of those principles is also important. The principle that everyone has the right to live his/her own life without unwanted interference from others is, if not impossible to implement, then contrary to the fact that the moral goodness of interference is not dependent on the whims of whomever is being interfered with.","logic-war-drugs","07:02 PM","government-debates","2"

The logic of the War on Drugs still leads Christians to conclude that theocracy is good. Community is a non-entity, an abstraction. It cannot be harmed. That is a flat-out falsity. Granted, the principle I stated in the first post does have good ""real world"" effects. If individuals are allowed to pursue their own happiness without unwanted interference, then the maximum utilitarian good follows. So it is moral to interfere in someone's life against his will, thereby reducing happiness? Now, you may have some twisted anti-utilitarian morality, but I do not.","logic-war-drugs","07:24 PM","government-debates","3"
"05-22-2005","5346",1,"Nurglitch","None","I can only speak for myself, The community is exactly the sum of its parts and their arrangement so you can harm it through either harming its parts or their culture. How do you figure? I thought this was evidence from Godel's incompleteness theorem - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_proof The problem I think you face here is that people are embedded in communities, and that they occasionally have conflicting interests. If the maximum utilitarian good is taken to be the aggregate utility gained by each person, then where conflict appears the maximum utilitarian good is lowered by attempting to maximize the utility of each person in the conflict. This can be demonstrated using the model of the "" Prisoner's Dilemma "" Funny, I always considered that it was you utilitarian-consequentialists that were twisted. It is moral to interfere with someone's personal autonomy where doing so prevents further further interference with that autonomy or prevents worse interferences with the autonomy of others. We can restrain one person to stop them killing another, for example, and we may restrain them to stop them harming themselves. A single person's happiness cannot be the moral good because morality is concerned with groups of people, with doing good for the others. Doing good for oneself is merely prudence.","Dzeron","126720","How can ""culture"" be harmed? Culture is a non-entity. [/QUOTE] Godel's theorems basically state that consistent theories can't prove themselves to be consistent. They do not state that all theories are inconsistent. I am not talking about maximizing the utilitarian good of only one individual at the expense of others - that would mean setting up that individual as a dictator. The problem you face is that harm is defined by the individual, as individuals have different preferences. The pot-head, for example, smokes pot because doing so increases his happiness as defined by him. To interfere with him decreases his happiness, without objectively increasing the happiness of anyone else. There is nothing moral in interfering in the individual's right to make choices in matters that only affect himself. If so, the War on Drugs is immoral. It is nothing more than a mean-spirited crusade to reduce the happiness of the pot-heads.","logic-war-drugs","02:31 PM","government-debates","5"

I do believe there is enough evidence to convicne me that one enjoying a little reefer in many situations can harm me directly or, more likely indirectly. That said, I'd prefer to put that type of drug use up there with alcohol and cigarettes. Then have it stamped out by general consensus that smoking just ain't kosher and drinking is only tolerated in certain circumstances. Not to speak for all recreational drug users, but from personal experience I've found many to be judgement impaired abusers as the drug use over rides other forms of rational thought they may have had. Addiction. Excessive users of any substance often lower work productivity and can have impaired abilities. There's a reason why you shouldn't operate heavy machinery when using certain medications. And, how many people have consciously known that driving while intoxicated is just something they'd never consider...until they they were intoxicated and incapable of making further rational descisions. My 'community' is harmed by accidental deaths and lower work productivity resulting in higher costs of certain items. Insurances increase and taxes used for other, IMO better, programs go towards rehabilitation and support of people who'd normally be self suffecient. This affects my pocket, my quality of life. Thus, I have a lower sense of happiness when someone 'uses.' Compound this by the multitudes and we get the same mentality of those who supported prohibition. In the case of prohibition, the chronic and extensive use of alcohol in society for untold generations coupled with the added problems caused by prohibition in the form of crime ment the 'cure' was as bad or worse than the illness.","logic-war-drugs","04:06 PM","government-debates","6"

This is one of the best debates I've read so far,.. I'm about to wear out my dictionary. Hope I'm not being rude to interupt your train of thought here ( like I could ) and let me apoligize up front for it. Any how, .. the above quote caused me to recall a real life situation. This is a true story. I my self discovered pot while still in high school, .. I was a freshman. I also discoverd alcohol. My friends and I soon came to realize that getting pot was as easy as Going to school,.. Going to the park,.. Going to the pool hall,.. Going to the public swimming pool,.. Going to the party at a friends house,.. Yadda .. Yadda ..Yadda .. and ect. IT WAS EASY.!! Now getting alcohol that was a little tricky. It involved having a friend, .. who knew sombody that was 21 or older,.. waiting sometimes for hours to show up,.. expecting you to give them money or buy them some,.. then waiting for them to return . Of course if someone had an older brother or sister ,.. and they weren't going on a date,.. or had to work,..or any number of other things ,.. problem solved! The point??? "" The war on drugs "" ..... Can be extended to our youth. I'll leave you to your discussion now . Thanks","logic-war-drugs","12:35 AM","government-debates","8"
"05-24-2005","5346",1,"Nurglitch","None","Happiness, unfortunately, is quite distinct from the moral good and even prudence. The fact that the pot-head enjoys smoking pot entails neither the prudence of doing so, nor the rightness of doing so.

"05-25-2005","5346",1,"Nurglitch","None","Your culture is how you interact with other members of your community. When a culture is harmed, the individuals who participate in that community are harmed by extension. If we cannot prove any system consistent, then no system is consistent. Neither am I. Indeed, that's only the second worst outcome in the PD. Where everyone tries to maximize their utility is the worst outcome because everyone has to do so at the great expense of others. Sorry, but I think you're mistaking the fact that individuals can only define what they perceive to be harm with the definition of harm itself which is communally defined. Happiness, unfortunately, is quite distinct from the moral good and even prudence. The fact that the pot-head enjoys smoking pot entails neither the prudence of doing so, nor the rightness of doing so. It may be the case that it is prudent, moral, or both, but it is only contingently so. I disagree. Even when a person is a complete stranger and totally isolated from a community it may be moral to save him from doing really stupid things to himself. Obviously, on utilitarian grounds the harm involved must be greater than the harm involved in that interference, but that counts on deontological, social-contract, and virtue-based grounds as well. More to the point, I don't think that the 'logic' of the 'War on Drugs' is easily transferable to things such as alien ideologies, as the 'War on Drugs' depends on a combination of very real and visible harm caused by the hard drugs, and people's ignorance of the proper use and etiquette of the soft drugs.","Dzeron","128524","Do you have any idea what you are talking about? A culture cannot be harmed. That is fallacious. You do know that the Prisoner's Dilemma is not a reflection of a free society? It is a scenario where individuals MUST interfere with the lives of others. Really? So a Christian community can define atheism as harmful, eh? Harm is subjective. What one person regards as harmful may be regarded as helpful by another (for example, conversion to Islam.) The only basis for defining harm is the individual basis, through the system of title and consent. What entitles you, or anyone, to judge what the pot-head should do to his own body? If you know anything about choice theory, utils are defined subjectively, and just because you see negative utils in smoking pot does not mean everybody does. What if the stranger does not perceive what he does to himself as harmful? Oh, right, and the authorities magically know what is ""proper"" and what is ""harmful."" How could I forget that the authorities are omniscient gods! The fact is that the War on Drugs is a subjectivist crusade, nothing more. Puritanical Nazis want to dictate to us what we can do with our bodies to the end of forcing us into living cookie-cutter lives. The War on Drugs reduces human life to the property of the State, preventing us from ""harming ourselves"" so we can be better tools for the ruling class.

Where is the morality in that?","Nurglitch","128563","Cultures can be harmed, especially through changes in language, loss of traditions, and the encroachment of alien ideas. A culture is harmed when its facilitation of community activity is impaired. For example, you can harm a culture by forcing the community holding that culture to change their language or adopt a new one. The exertion of that force interferes with the community members' ability to participate in their culture, degrading its efficacy as a tool for social order. This is much like a knife may be harmed if sharpened on an unsuitable whetstone, a culture may be harmed by changes in its influences. Okay. Care to tell us why it is fallacious? I'm well aware that the inability to prove something ordinarily doesn't count against there actually being something to prove, but because consistency is something defined by our ability to prove it, a proof by contradition appears to stand. No, I'm saying that the Prisoner's Dilemma is a model of free societies precisely because the individuals must make a choice about how they are to interfere with each other's lives. Any society, however free, is still a concourse of competing interests. As Karl Popper would point out, a society free of competing interests would be a society of ants and not of humans. I think you may be misunderstanding what I meant by communities defining harm. Communities are the context by which harm is defined - no intentional or active sense should be taken to be implied by this statement. Atheism may indeed be harmful to a Christian community, because not because some entity call 'the community' decided that it was so I think that you're confusing that fact that harm may be perceived subjectively with the objective fact of harm. That's my fault though for not cutting to the heart of the matter: Perception is subjective, and fact is objective. The fact that individuals have different preferences does not entail that harm is subjective, but merely that the perception of harm is subjective. This perception of harm is also made in the cultural context of the community. But to also confuse this perception of harm with harm itself is also a mistake. Moral obligation 'entitles' us, regardless of our perception of it, or the mode in which we understand it. Good manners also requires that we tell the pot-head and the rest of the community our judgment so that it may be subject to peer-review. Judging the pot-head's actions is very important because doing so gives us good morals grounds for formulating a response to the pot-head's behaviour. Such judgment will establish which is worse, either the harm that smoking pot does or the harm that preventing people from smoking pot when they responsibly choose to. Personally I think that preventing certain people from responsibly using marijuana is more harmful than criminalizing it, and certain others should be prevented from using it at all. Then the stranger is an idiot and doubly in need of protection. I don't recall making that claim. In fact, I think I that I specially stated: So rather than claim that the ""authorities are omniscient"" I actually noted that authority is fallible by refering to the crude methodology of the 'War on Drugs', which is a program enacted under the authority of the Government of the United States. Interestingly the problems that the 'War on Drugs' cause are the result of the US gov't failing to recognize the important distinction between the perception of harm and harm itself. In failing to make this distinction, the 'War on Drugs' conflates its perception of harm with harm itself and fails to subject that perception to adequate peer review. The result is a clumsy one-size-fits-all policy (much like moral relativism) that causes more harm than necessary in its application. I disagree. As I have argued, it's a clumsy application of good will rather than any intrinsically wrong. Hmm. I think you may find it useful to read up on classical liberal conceptions of rights so that you understand how rights come into conflict in a liberal-democratic society, and how those conflicts are resolved. In a liberal society such as the USA, a choice is made about the primature of rights such that the interactions of those rights in human political concourse maximized the freedom of the individual citizen. The problem is that this maximizes the freedom of those citizens whose interests match up most advantageously against their freedoms. But they argue that it's the only way to maximize the overall freedom of everyone. Bringing this back to the Prisoner's Dilemma, and this is exactly what the liberal project proposes, the only way to maximize the overall freedom of everyone is to accept some limitations to their freedoms. The use of force to enforce those rights legitimized by a system of moral reciprocity where citizens agree to live by the same set of rules. Which is why I think you're un-necessarily demonizing those people who support the 'War on Drugs'. I tried to point this out using the old metaphor that the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. The point of that metaphor is that all reasonable people work from good intentions. Those intentions have to compete with greed, and may be at the mercy of an inadequate patience for careful thought, but when they're channelled into such a massive and well-organized law-projects they have to be expressions of moral conviction. These people enact laws from moral conviction. Accusing these people of being evil just reinforces their conviction. And the more they're convinced of their moral high ground, the harder it is to convince them they're wrong. Genuine malevolence is rare, and since alienating people through misunderstanding is counter-productive, you really should give people the benefit of the doubt when assessing intentions because intentions are so hard to judge. It's certainly more productive, and definitely more anarchistic to work from principles of good will under proven otherwise.","logic-war-drugs","08:19 PM","government-debates","14"
