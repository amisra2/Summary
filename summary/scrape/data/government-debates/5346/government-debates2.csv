"05-26-2005","5346",2,"Symbiote","None","It seems to me that when a culture is harmed, the individuals who participate in that community may just as well benefit by extension, depending on whether the harmed culture was conducive to their interests. For example, if a culture of racism is harmed. Or more probably, any change would harm some and help others. Competing interests can exist without interference in others' lives. For example, two girls like the same guy - they might compete for his affections, or one might kill the other. The phrase ""In a free society"", though I can't remember where exactly it comes from, refers to a society in which conflicts are resolved through property rights rather than violent intervention. You've already said though, that you don't believe you can add or subtract utility between people, so where does that leave you in deciding which is worse?","Nurglitch","128662","It depends on how things go down during the transitional period between stable instantiations of culture. During these periods when a culture is changing, people become alienated from each other as misunderstandings increase. So people can benefit at the expense of their own culture, so long as they don't fall victim to cultural change - as Canada's aboriginal people commonly seem to be. Indeed they can, but those aren't the problematic cases: those competing interests to whom interference in other's lives is necessary (directly or indirectly). Exactly, by all parties compromising with laws instead of resorting to violence freedom is maximized for each individual by guaranteeing a minimum set of rights. By making rights a necessary, but not sufficient, condition on freedom, people who can expand their freedom so long as it is not brought into conflict with the rights of others. Ah, this brings me to a moral scheme I'm going to present to the Dalhousie Colloquium on July 8th: the economics of ethics. The idea is to treat people's interests as being balanced against each other to produce a hierarchy of interests. This way the good can be considered as a scarce resource to be bought with valuable interests. What exactly is better or worse may be cashed out differently in different cultures, but there are absolute limits set by economic models such that certain interests must necessarily have a low value and other interests must necessarily have a high value. Such an Economist's Dilemma couches morality in a language sensitive to both context and limits - a full moral vocabulary of good/bad, better/worse, reciprocity, and motivation. Instead of deciding which state of the world is worse by judging comparative aggregate utility scores, we decide which state of the world and method of achieving it best satisfies all of our interests. If you want to know what is right or wrong in a moral economy, you have to know what costs you're willing to incur for what benefits. Some costs will always outweigh the benefits, and are absolutely wrong. Some benefits will always outweigh the costs, and are absolutely right. Some costs and benefits will be context dependent such that they will either be valued either higher or lower, better or worse. Now, I'm worried that you'll interpret this as simply being a sophisticated form of utilitarianism. The economic model does provide formal limits by which such values are determined and quantified. Unlike the utilitarian theory however, the number of the interests catered to, the distribution, and the manner in which the distribution occurs, the cost of distribution, are as important as the aggregate total value. Thus the economics of ethics provides a framework that accomodates both case sensitivity and universality.","logic-war-drugs","03:47 AM","government-debates","16"
"05-26-2005","5346",2,"Symbiote","None","And isn't culture in a constant state of flux - and in this sense constantly being ""harmed""? Again, supposing the ""racist culture"" example, would not the change be a period where people become less alienated from each other? Doesn't Kim Jong-Il gets more ""freedom"" by resorting to violence? It seems to me unlikely any particular world-state will best satisfy all of our interests. You are then left with weighing one person's interests against another, are you not? The system may not be utilitarian, but it does appear as a sophisticated consequentialist model.","Nurglitch","128810","Culture is certainly something fluid, I agree. Think of the healthy development of culture as being like velocity - where the culture changes naturally at a constant rate of change. Where that rate of change itself changes, like acceleration, is the 'change' that I'm talking about. A culture in which change is changing, accelerating or decelerating, is a culture being harmed. Think of these two kinds of changes as frictionless change and frictional change, with the latter being what I mean when I say 'change harms a culture' and the former being just a part of culture-qua-object. The cultural discontinuities of frictional change affects people's ability to use their culture to interact with other members of that community in a non-confrontational way. When changes in culture accelerate, people cannot use culture as effectively as a social medium. Imagine using a hammer whose shape and balance were rapidly changing, and you can see how a tool, social or otherwise, can be harmed by change. I think we need to distinguish between alienation between communities of people and alienation within communities of people. Alienation within the community is a by-product of this change of change, and the alienation between communities is business as usual. Supposing steady changes in a racist culture were leading to less alienation from people of neighboring cultures, a cultural convergence, then that would seem to be good and not harmful. But suppose that such changes began to accelerate, so that people used to a steady rate of change couldn't keep up, then internal alienation increases. This increase in internal alienation blunts and subverts those decreases in external alienation. Yes, and he does so at the expense of other members of his community. I think it was Rawls that pointed out any ethical system that didn't account for consequences was 'insane'. What the system I propose does is allow interests to be weighed against each other, using an economic model, by ranking them according to the number of other interests they are compatible with. Some interests everyone obviously shares, some interests no-one has or wants, and some interests and their distribution varies amongst people depending on their context. I'm deliberately avoiding any discussion of the value of such interests, except as they relate to one another and facilitate one another, because I agree that a strictly consequentialist theory fails when confronted by uncertainty. The way that the market model processes information is a way of hedging against uncertainty and catering to the intuition that consequences matter. Likewise the formal limits of such a model cater to the intuition that our moral responsibility has certain limits and boundaries. These limits are the pure 'deontological' components of the theory and are formally decided.This means that we can know what is wrong, what is right, and have a method for resolving moral conflicts and dealing with moral risks.","logic-war-drugs","12:20 PM","government-debates","18"

The War on Drugs is based on the idea that people have no right to harm themselves.","Mach","129112","I disagree, I think that's entirely not what drug laws in America are about. The war on drugs is just another right that is willingly given up in return for preservation of a great many other freedoms. In any real-life system with humans, competition, and community arise. Strict libertarian prinicples favor the individual over community. That is, each individual gets to decide what is, and is not good for themselves, and the community is not part of the equation except as a by-product of individual interaction. So two societies of primate animals (humans), driven by what most primates are driven by, lust, power, violence, shelter, food, socializing are in a competitive environment. Enter drugs. Low and behold, the way humans are driven to seek pleasure and avoid pain, is suddenly given a free ticket to limitless (?) pleasure with very little effort. Why work for years, 8+ hours a day, to make money to attain a new house (which gives some pleasure), when a hit of say, meth, takes you to heaven on earth? There is no real reason not to. What would this do to a captialistic society dependant on the carrot and stick approach to achievement, power, security? As a result, community protects itself, that is, makes the longer term comittment to not allow itself to take the easy road to pleasure, and instead attempts to force most everyone down the long, hard road of achievement that we know and except in a capitalistic society. With free short cuts to laziness (drugs, slaves, whatever), the society that embraces it, is weakened, and open to conquest. We abhor weakness in a competitive system. We succeed as a whole where the individual will fail. It's nothing more than a rational decision when faced with the reality of the human condition, with regards to community in a competitive environment. Perhaps when the world has a more homogenous culture/economy (and ability to control the human condition?), we'll see it shift to more individual freedoms. Until then, I suspect it's not a wise decision. Restriction of some individual rights in favor of community, is what allows individuals to ponder their lack of certain individual rights while kicking back eating Doritos, slurping Coke, and typing on a PC, all in their secure little nest. Let me spell it out clearly in case that's too abstract. You have no rights except those which are granted to you by other indivuals. You have no inherent right to individual freedoms (or anything). In a competitive system where there are winners, and losers, the winners get to make the rules, the rights, and anything else they choose. -Mach","logic-war-drugs","11:00 PM","government-debates","20"
"05-27-2005","5346",2,"Symbiote","None","I don't think that's a useful way to think of a culture being harmed. If we are talking about a given culture being harmed, it is harmed precisely to the extent that it is changed. A slower rate of change means less harm to that particular brand of culture. But whether culture overall, rather than a particular historical instance of culture, is being harmed, has no basis apart from individual value judgements - some see the new wave of culture as better than the old, some worse. Not neccessarily. The existing culture could be a ""culture of alienation within the community"", the change in culture being a decrease in alienation within the community. That's what I'm saying though, there isn't a single world state which maximises ""freedom"" for all of us as individuals, and its meaningless to try and maximise ""freedom"" for all of us as a group. I also disagree with the definiton of freedom you use, under which someone who is allowed to enslave others is regarded as being more free than someone who isn't, but I understand where you are coming from, from some previous posts you have made. You may be able to develop a system that most people are reasonably content with (like our democracies now, really), but I don't believe it possible to find any non-arbitrary basis for weightings of interests between people, based on any criteria. Rawls would say something like that, it's very much in tune with his philosophy, but I disagree completely. An ethical system cannot account for consequences, since no particular set of consequences is in any objective sense better than any other, and any set of consequences aimed for an aesthetic or practical, rather than ethical, judgement. I never willingly gave up a right to shoot morphine into my eye. Government tries to manufacture consent, through statements like ""we oppose drugs"" and acting as if it is the people, so that when it bans something, the people have chosen to give it up, or when it kills Jews, they have really committed suicide.","Nurglitch","129167","The point I'm trying to make is that culture-qua-tool develops and changes, and the pace of that development affects the efficacy of a culture as a facilitator of social interaction. If you're going to take a sample-slice out of an ongoing process of cultural development and fetishize it, as some people do, then you're probably going to regard any deviation from that static sample as harmful because that it supposedly represents an ideal state of culture. I think that the problem here is that you're interpreting me as claiming that harming a culture necessarily harms the individuals who use that culture. I'm arguing that interfering with a culture's usefulness as a tool for social interaction constitutes harm to it. Similarly interfering with a knife's usefulness as a tool for cutting harms that knife in the sense that I am using 'harm'. Sorry for the misunderstanding. Certainly some people see new developments in culture as benefitting or costing them, but the harm to the culture-qua-culture is something apart from culture-qua-community and individual people's interests. Some people may prefer a blunter knife (for chopping corn-cobs, for example), or even a broken knife. Melting down a knife for its steel 'harms' the knife, although it may benefit the new owner to use the steel for some other application. Harm to a culture is not necessarily harm to the individuals whose culture is being harmed. When a community's culture is harmed by an increasing or decreasing rate of development in that culture, it becomes less effective as a tool for social interaction and stimulates individuals alienation from each other and their community, as well as failing to ameliorate confrontation as well. For some people this may be an opportunity and for others it may be a crisis. But the fact that culture is being harmed is pretty objective because the institutions of that culture break down. I think I'd reject the notion of a ""culture of alienation"" as a culture-qua-culture and interpret it as culture-qua-community. That is to say a ""culture of alienation"" would just be a community in the throws of rapid cultural change. When that change slows back down then alienation would decrease as culture becomes more stable and more user-friendly. Oh, I'm sure that there is a world-state, and indeed a set of world-states in which the total amount and equal distribution of freedom is 'maximized'. More to the point, I'm trying to point out that a person that cannot be owned as a slave is more free than a person that can be owned as a slave. I'm defining freedom as an individual's ability to satisfy their interests. While an individual may have an interest in owning slaves, that interest is secondary to the interest of all other individuals not to be slaves. Freedom may be in relation to the interests of the agent, but those interests are valued in relation to all other interests and their possible satisfaction. Indeed, and that's exactly the reason that I argue we should use a market model when dealing with ethics. In the absence of any non-arbitrary basis for weighting interests, I think we should bite the bullet like the mathematicians did and devise formal axiomatic systems whose worth is decided by how they handle ethical propositions. Depends on how you treat the formal relations and the content of that ethical system I think. Universal formal relations and limits don't automatically priviledge any set of consequences (content) to which they pertain, that is true. What priviledges these consequences are how they relate to one another in that system. The system is what provides the objective grounds upon which specific consequences may be valued. Different system, different values. The system merely needs to handle a sufficiently complete universe of ethical discourse. True, but then since representative government is supposed to do that for you then it all works out then eh? Far be it from me to argue in favour of representative government. The point is that by remaining a citizen of a country, you're implicitly consenting to their laws, and if you don't like those laws then there are legal opportunities for you to encourage your government to change them. Of course, you probably can't change them, but that's what you get for assenting to representative government. But yeah, I agree with you that drug laws weaken a community. But then a community that can allow the implementation of drug laws through acts of government on behalf of the people already has some pretty serious weaknesses to begin with - if people won't take responsibility for their own governance, how can we expect them to responsibly use drugs?* *Some drugs are responsibly used by avoiding them at all costs, I'd like to point out. Not because a nice man from the government told you so, but because you're aware of the effects of their use and are smart enough to infer from those effects that they harm you and your interests.","logic-war-drugs","12:43 AM","government-debates","22"
"05-27-2005","5346",2,"Symbiote","None","My point is, that because ""freedom"" or ""happiness"" or the ""good"" isn't a thing, it has no unit of measurement and it is inappropriate to talk about the ""total amount"" of it. You can talk about it increasing overall meaningfully if it increases for some and does not decrease for any, or decreasing overall if it is worse for some and better for none. I think you have a strong alternative in ethical systems that revolve around actions, rather than consequences. A market model is probably going to be superior system than a direct commanding, in as much as market socialism as present in nazi germany was a superior system to the soviet model, but I don't believe it's appropriate when you have an alternative. But then it does not follow that an increase or decrease in the rate of change neccessarily constitutes harm to it, so long as the changed rate increases its ""usefulness for social interaction"". Or it could be a culture in where there was any given rate of cultural change where women were not allowed to have any social contact apart from their husbands, for example. This can accurately be described as a ""culture of alienation"", that change to would be a decrease in alienation, would it not? I don't believe that to be the case, I may as well say that by living near me you're implicitly consenting to live by my laws.","Nurglitch","129174","Okay, but I'm trying to point out that we can quantify 'freedom' or 'interests' by evaluating them in relation to each other, much like we can with 'money'. Such as? Okay, so what alternatives do you suppose are preferable? I'm not sure why I'm having trouble communicating this, but the increase or decrease in the rate of change necessarily constitutes harm precisely because that increase or decrease in the rate of change mitigates the usefulness of culture as a tool for governing social interactions. I'm afraid I don't follow you. I think you misunderstanding me again, because for the life of me I can't figure out what you're trying to say here. Don't suppose you could explain my position and how this comment relates to it could you? Hardly. Residence is not the same as citizenship. Living near someone does not mean that you have to live by their laws. Living as part of a legal body such as a country means that you do have to live by their laws. Being part of a country is a legal relation, not a spatial relation.","logic-war-drugs","01:19 AM","government-debates","24"
