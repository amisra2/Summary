Oh, wait, that was me in a two room apartment, twenty-five years ago. Flashbacks are a biatch. Nevermind. Bush a stoner? UH HUH, YAAAA, RIIIGHT. By chance, are your pubic hairs blonde?","george-bush-stoner","11:02 AM","government-debates","2"

The highs are too different. Besides which he replaced his alcohol addiction with addiction to religion. That is not to say that he is being drugged, he just may not know it.","george-bush-stoner","12:44 PM","government-debates","4"

I'm pretty sure he drinks a fifth or two before he heads to the Senate every morning. Noone could be that stupid and sober. BTW: new report just indicated that Bush is one of the healthiest presidents in history. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn...073000680.html","george-bush-stoner","08:33 AM","government-debates","6"
