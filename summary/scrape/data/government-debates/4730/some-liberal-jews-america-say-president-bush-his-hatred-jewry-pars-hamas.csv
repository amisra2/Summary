Truly, Bush doesnt care about the obvious rise of anti-Semitism sentiment in America. BTW there is even talk of the possible pogroms. I think we dont face the threat just now. As for future I am not equally optimistic. And I am expecting no good from Mr. Bush in this respect. I am working with a charity fund. Relating this sphere, I am ready with exact figures. Of the $100 million so far dispensed to faith based charities by Bush administration, not one dollar has gone to a Jewish organization. This doesnt add happiness you know. My grannies came here from Russia in search for democracy and better secure life. Times are changing. Now some of my relatives in Russia are quite well-off. They say Russias economy is taking off, which makes it perfectly for profitable investments. And they are feeling safe there. Frankly, I wouldnt like to leave. But if it goes this way Ill forced to.","some-liberal-jews-america-say-president-bush-his-hatred-jewry-pars-hamas","09:41 AM","government-debates","1"

Bush's reelection campaign platform included continued aid to Israel as a successful enticement for Jews who traditionally voted as democrats to vote for Bush.","some-liberal-jews-america-say-president-bush-his-hatred-jewry-pars-hamas","11:12 AM","government-debates","2"
