Since a statement is not completely true, it must be false. Imperialism and isolationism work the same way. Isolationism means non-aggression in military affairs; imperialism means aggression in military affairs. So if a nation is not isolationist, then that means it does not follow a non-aggression policy - hence, it is imperialist.","hell-us-military","09:30 PM","government-debates","31"

So if a nation is not isolationist, then that means it does not follow a non-aggression policy - hence, it is imperialist. Imperialism, Noun 1. The policy of extending a nation's authority by territorial acquisition or by the establishment of economic and political hegemony over other nations. 2. The system, policies, or practices of such a government. Any nation that is not militarily isolationist is imperialist.","Zardoz","105856","Militarism is not the defining nature of Imperialism. Sorry. It just isn't. Control is. By the very nature of imperialism, all nations are imperialistic in one form or another. Most economicly. And, if you tie in military to the definition of imperialism, then it means the acquisition of territory by force. Something the US really hasn't done. And, if they are militarily imperialistic, then they sux. Also, Isolationism doesn't have to be passive. I could be an isolationist who responded militarily to any 'threat' and call it defense. So, while I see myself as sitting back minding my own business and responding with force to any 'attack' upon my nation; be it economic, military, social or other wise, you might see my response to the 'intrusion' as aggression or at the very least unjustified. Like is not always responded to with like. If I'm unable to turn your economic dominance aside through the use of economic force, I may resort to useing violence. Heck, it may be my only option to defend myself. For example, I design a anti-pest virus that also happens to kill off the food supplies the pest feds upon. I also design a fertalizer that protects my food supplies from the virus. I'm prepared to release the virus in a very uncontrolled manner that may spread world wide. I dispise this pest locally because it cause illness in my citizens and I have a duty to my citizens. Being isolationistic, I refuse to deal with other nations so they don't get the fertalizer nor access to the virus. Nor am I interested in an alternative solution to my problems. Just bugger off an leave me alone...or I'll nuke you. Now, how do you respond. I am not intentionally targeting you with the virus. I'm just being careless (according to you) with my applications. I also don't really care about you. You could fall off the world for all I care. Do you view my wreckless behavior as aggression? Do you become the aggressor if you respond militarily to my behavior? In WWII, was Japan an aggressor? OR, were they responding to agression since they were forced onto the world stage via gun boat diplomacy several decades back. Heck, according to Hitler, the poor germans were responding to imperialistic aggression by the Zionists and were forced to take military action due to economic factors forced upon them by external groups. Military action is nothing more than an aspect of political interaction. I know I'm pretty tired of Frances and Belgiums naked aggression. I'd also like to see various religious organizations brought before the ICC on charges. Vatican city should be stopped in it Imperialistic encroachments of religious hegemony upon the world. Religious control is political control as far as I'm concearned. The EU should be defended against due to their economic imperialism attempts. Is simply not a true statement. Thus, it is false. A nation that is militarily isolationistic can still be imperialistic in the realms of politics and economics. A nation is imperialistic if it's practices are imperialistic. Be it militarily, economically, culturally, politically or otherwise. It's all about control. And with that, the US is merely responding to naked aggression by the rest of the world. Yep, they threw the first stone in my book. The peace loving peoples of America would be quite content to be left alone. But, the world refuses to comply. I'd like to mention that I was paid, in gold, the sum of $237.00 USD by The MAN to say this. I was offered 200. but, with the rising price of gas, I negotiated in the cost of travel expenses at the inflated levels currently seen in todays market. I blame this increase upon imperialistic forces seeking to economically enslave me. The funds recieved by me coupled with my eco-terrorism training will allow me to take the fight to their shores. Once the flames arise over their petro-pollution storage facilities, they will know I'm not one to be triffled with. Thick black smoke will usher in a newer, cleaner world.

Isn't the motive tied to a ""material interest"" of some kind ? Unless there's some profit from the economic and financial exploitation of the dominated area, what's the point of occupying it (even by proxy) ? If American imperialism exists, I don't think it's driven by the desire to build an empire for the purposes of ""prestige""; and there is historical evidence to support the case that America was traditionally an anti-imperial power. One of the aims of the United States in World War II, beyond the mere defeat of Germany and Japan, was to bring about the destruction of European imperialism. Is the current foreign policy of the US (at least with respect to the Middle East) a departure from its historical abhorrence of the imperial mood ?","hell-us-military","12:50 PM","government-debates","35"

If a country asked the US for political/economic help in achieving a peaceful transition to democracy, I would not be opposed to that. There is a lot of recent historical evidence to support the theory that America has supported and perhaps continues to support authoritarian regimes for geo-political purposes and for reasons of state.

I agree that changes in ideology must come from within, not defined as a condition for a more powerful nation overthrowing a government. That includes democracy, communism, socialism or whatever.
