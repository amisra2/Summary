As for meaning, that's up to each listener, some would find meaning in the phone book put to music. Here's a few published country songs that have little meaning: 1. I Liked You Better Before I Knew You So Well 2. I Still Miss You Baby, But My Aim's Gettin' Better 3. I Wouldn't Take Her To A Dog Fight, Cause I'm Afraid She'd Win 4. I'll Marry You Tomorrow But Let's Honeymoon Tonight 5. I'm So miserable Without You, It's Like Having You Here 6. Mama Get A Hammer (There's A Fly On Papa's Head) 7. My Head Hurts, My Feet Stink, And I Love Rovers 8. Please Bypass this Heart 9. She Got The Ring and I Got The Finger 10. You're the Reason Our Kids Are So Ugly Dono","hell-us-military","09:37 PM","government-debates","91"
