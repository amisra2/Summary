When we question the administration's policy, we are not ""bashiing the military"". Do we not have the right of ""Freedom of Expression"", and ""Freedom of speech"" to question the policy ? That is not ""bashing the military"".","hell-us-military","09:06 AM","government-debates","64"

Being subjected to a highly regimented system of living by unquestionably following orders for 20, 30 or more years will do that.","hell-us-military","10:20 AM","government-debates","65"

Ever seen the movie ""Equilibrium""? Early on in the film the main character is questioned about his beliefs and feelings, and can only repeat the propaganda that he's been subjected to all his life.","hell-us-military","12:38 PM","government-debates","66"

They had more sympathy for the NVN then they did their own military......Liberals like Kerry who called our military murderers, rapists and baby killers..Liberals who spit on and insulted military people on their return from Nam just becasue they were doing their job.......... Liberals have no stomach to see the war in Iraq through to the end........They would like to cut and run.......... Thank God we have a president who does not pay attention to the left wing whacko polls and makes decisions and stands by them......... You lefties will have a long wait if you think this president is goin to cut and run and desert the good people of Iraq........","hell-us-military","08:32 PM","government-debates","67"

The new government is begging for more US 'security', our military is being killed, we're being seriously financially nicked, off-record pentagon sources are broadcasting our failure and the, ahem, 'insurgents' are stepping up their campaign.

I think the more accurate way to approach this right now is to concede ... this insurgency is not going to be settled, the terrorists and the terrorism in Iraq is not going to be settled, through military options or military operations"" - Brig. General Donald Alston, chief military spokesman in Iraq. Doesn't sound too desperate to me, this type of warfare can be sustained indefinately.
