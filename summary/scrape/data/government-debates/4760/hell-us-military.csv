Same as Vietnam, when we had in excess of 700,000 troops in that country and only China's threat with corresponding US public distaste due to media coverage for that undeclared war stopped our aggression. Hitler's political advantage was bringing a bankrupt nation back to solvency through a military based economy, achieving a heroic status, while US leaders have a fat, complacent public with mostly lower classes contributing cannon fodder on a volunteer basis.

When we still had the Sauds, the Shah of Iran and Saddam in our pocket and Israel through a series of US supported military engagements controlled other ME policy, we pretty much controlled the entire ME through proxy. We dislike forfeiting any advantage. Especially when such a valuable commodity as oil was traded using only USD, meaning they wouldn't return to our treasury for redemption, allowing our printing presses to run full-speed with that demand for US securities (debt). Vietnam didn't turn out as intended primarily because of China stating in no uncertain terms that a US force large enough to conquer S. and N. Vietnam sitting on their border would be considered a direct threat with appropriate retaliation. Iraq offered no such determent. I'm an American, and loyal to my country, but not one to favor or condemn what US foreign policy has accomplished within its sphere.

In the next county to the one where I'm living in now, there's the World War II American Memorial Cemetery (at a place called Madingley, Cambridgeshire) and not far from there, is the Army Air Force Memorial at Duxford. I've been to both places a couple of times: each time I was appalled by the sheer number of graves/remembrance motifs - a huge loss of life of men and women who served in the European theatre of operations. Did they even need to be involved ? (I asked myself). My native land wasn't.

It took Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor to change that public mood. Germany, aligned with Japan, then declared war on the US. I considered that a just war, the US just got into it a little before we were ready and took a real beating in the Pacific Theater (Japan) while concentrating on the European Theater. When one looks at losses sustained by Russia, Germany and other European nations, US losses pale in comparison. The difference being that the US was given credit for winning the war, justifiably so, primarily because our undisturbed industrial capability literally overwhelmed the enemy. That's the way I view WW2, another war, with the usual results. The unfortunate loss of life can be viewed as deplorable or a basis for renewal, depending on one's point of view and level of personal involvement. If I was a survivor in a small French village trampled by the Germans, I'd probably be eternally grateful for the American capability.

You are projecting colonialism on a country that saw the benefit of ceasing to be a colony. True, we had some ""possessions"" and we made a state out of Hawaii, but we don't invade and take over countries like those you mentioned. It's not easy to assess the size or exact value of our empire of bases. Official records on these subjects are misleading, although instructive. According to the Defense Department's annual ""Base Structure Report"" for fiscal year 2003, which itemizes foreign and domestic U.S. military real estate, the Pentagon currently owns or rents 702 overseas bases in about 130 countries and HAS another 6,000 bases in the United States and its territories. Pentagon bureaucrats calculate that it would require at least $113.2 billion to replace just the foreign bases -- surely far too low a figure but still larger than the gross domestic product of most countries -- and an estimated $591,519.8 million to replace all of them. The military high command deploys to our overseas bases some 253,288 uniformed personnel, plus an equal number of dependents and Department of Defense civilian officials, and employs an additional 44,446 locally hired foreigners. The Pentagon claims that these bases contain 44,870 barracks, hangars, hospitals, and other buildings, which it owns, and that it leases 4,844 more. These numbers, although staggeringly large, do not begin to cover all the actual bases we occupy globally. The 2003 Base Status Report fails to mention, for instance, any garrisons in Kosovo -- even though it is the site of the huge Camp Bondsteel, built in 1999 and maintained ever since by Kellogg, Brown & Root. The Report similarly omits bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, Israel, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Qatar, and Uzbekistan, although the U.S. military has established colossal base structures throughout the so-called arc of instability in the two-and-a-half years since 9/11.","gnojek","105619","Didn't we?

Isolationism means non-aggression in military affairs; imperialism means aggression in military affairs. So if a nation is not isolationist, then that means it does not follow a non-aggression policy - hence, it is imperialist. Imperialism, Noun 1. The policy of extending a nation's authority by territorial acquisition or by the establishment of economic and political hegemony over other nations. 2. The system, policies, or practices of such a government. Any nation that is not militarily isolationist is imperialist.","Zardoz","105856","Militarism is not the defining nature of Imperialism. Sorry. It just isn't. Control is. By the very nature of imperialism, all nations are imperialistic in one form or another. Most economicly. And, if you tie in military to the definition of imperialism, then it means the acquisition of territory by force. Something the US really hasn't done. And, if they are militarily imperialistic, then they sux. Also, Isolationism doesn't have to be passive. I could be an isolationist who responded militarily to any 'threat' and call it defense. So, while I see myself as sitting back minding my own business and responding with force to any 'attack' upon my nation; be it economic, military, social or other wise, you might see my response to the 'intrusion' as aggression or at the very least unjustified. Like is not always responded to with like. If I'm unable to turn your economic dominance aside through the use of economic force, I may resort to useing violence. Heck, it may be my only option to defend myself. For example, I design a anti-pest virus that also happens to kill off the food supplies the pest feds upon. I also design a fertalizer that protects my food supplies from the virus. I'm prepared to release the virus in a very uncontrolled manner that may spread world wide. I dispise this pest locally because it cause illness in my citizens and I have a duty to my citizens. Being isolationistic, I refuse to deal with other nations so they don't get the fertalizer nor access to the virus. Nor am I interested in an alternative solution to my problems. Just bugger off an leave me alone...or I'll nuke you. Now, how do you respond. I am not intentionally targeting you with the virus. I'm just being careless (according to you) with my applications. I also don't really care about you. You could fall off the world for all I care. Do you view my wreckless behavior as aggression? Do you become the aggressor if you respond militarily to my behavior? In WWII, was Japan an aggressor? OR, were they responding to agression since they were forced onto the world stage via gun boat diplomacy several decades back. Heck, according to Hitler, the poor germans were responding to imperialistic aggression by the Zionists and were forced to take military action due to economic factors forced upon them by external groups. Military action is nothing more than an aspect of political interaction. I know I'm pretty tired of Frances and Belgiums naked aggression. I'd also like to see various religious organizations brought before the ICC on charges. Vatican city should be stopped in it Imperialistic encroachments of religious hegemony upon the world. Religious control is political control as far as I'm concearned. The EU should be defended against due to their economic imperialism attempts. Is simply not a true statement. Thus, it is false. A nation that is militarily isolationistic can still be imperialistic in the realms of politics and economics. A nation is imperialistic if it's practices are imperialistic. Be it militarily, economically, culturally, politically or otherwise. It's all about control. And with that, the US is merely responding to naked aggression by the rest of the world. Yep, they threw the first stone in my book. The peace loving peoples of America would be quite content to be left alone. But, the world refuses to comply. I'd like to mention that I was paid, in gold, the sum of $237.00 USD by The MAN to say this. I was offered 200. but, with the rising price of gas, I negotiated in the cost of travel expenses at the inflated levels currently seen in todays market. I blame this increase upon imperialistic forces seeking to economically enslave me. The funds recieved by me coupled with my eco-terrorism training will allow me to take the fight to their shores. Once the flames arise over their petro-pollution storage facilities, they will know I'm not one to be triffled with. Thick black smoke will usher in a newer, cleaner world.
