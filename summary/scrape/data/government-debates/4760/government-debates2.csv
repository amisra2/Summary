"04-08-2005","4760",2,"Alan Ryan","None","Now you seem to be suggesting a ""conquest by proxy"" - using Israel as the apparent aggressor, but with ulterior management by the US ? And the aim of this manoeuvre, if my question isn't too crude or crass, would be an oil grab for the US and ""security"" for Israel presumably ? I can't think of an apt modern historical comparison demonstrating the US behaving in such a devious and amoral way in its foreign policy - unless you can cite Vietnam as being analogous in some way. My problem with this sort of scenario is that I'm an Americanophile (I just coined that word, but you know what I mean). I tend to believe without a very convincing case to the contrary, that America does and has done more good than harm in the world. Naive ? Well, possibly.","georged","105480","That's the way I see it. When we still had the Sauds, the Shah of Iran and Saddam in our pocket and Israel through a series of US supported military engagements controlled other ME policy, we pretty much controlled the entire ME through proxy. We dislike forfeiting any advantage. Especially when such a valuable commodity as oil was traded using only USD, meaning they wouldn't return to our treasury for redemption, allowing our printing presses to run full-speed with that demand for US securities (debt). Vietnam didn't turn out as intended primarily because of China stating in no uncertain terms that a US force large enough to conquer S. and N. Vietnam sitting on their border would be considered a direct threat with appropriate retaliation. Iraq offered no such determent. I'm an American, and loyal to my country, but not one to favor or condemn what US foreign policy has accomplished within its sphere. No nation I'm aware of has ever expended resources without sovereign or special interest gain. My cynicism includes enough knowledge of trade favoritism gained through disaster aid, renumeration from support of bloody dictatorships and other not so altruistic policies that I've probably lost track of any good points relating to common populations of affected nations. I simply look at most things as the way the world works. The Marshall Plan didn't assist in rebuilding Europe for moral reasoning, but to stimulate economic recovery necessary for assistance in conversion of US industry from war materials to consumer and industrial products by providing additional markets for those US products. I don't believe any nation is different when it comes to self-serving purpose.","hell-us-military","01:20 PM","government-debates","16"

I don't have an effective rational response, so I'm going to deliberately provoke you by going off at an emotive tangent. In the next county to the one where I'm living in now, there's the World War II American Memorial Cemetery (at a place called Madingley, Cambridgeshire) and not far from there, is the Army Air Force Memorial at Duxford. I've been to both places a couple of times: each time I was appalled by the sheer number of graves/remembrance motifs - a huge loss of life of men and women who served in the European theatre of operations. Did they even need to be involved ? (I asked myself). My native land wasn't. I suppose reflecting on the American contribution to the liberation of Europe (1941-45), and other irrelevant personal reasons, has made me too ready to give the US the benefit of the doubt.","hell-us-military","01:54 PM","government-debates","17"
"04-08-2005","4760",2,"None","None","None","georged","105531","Despite every effort Roosevelt, the standing US president, made to get the US into WW2, the US public was overwhelmingly against it. It took Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor to change that public mood. Germany, aligned with Japan, then declared war on the US. I considered that a just war, the US just got into it a little before we were ready and took a real beating in the Pacific Theater (Japan) while concentrating on the European Theater. When one looks at losses sustained by Russia, Germany and other European nations, US losses pale in comparison. The difference being that the US was given credit for winning the war, justifiably so, primarily because our undisturbed industrial capability literally overwhelmed the enemy. That's the way I view WW2, another war, with the usual results. The unfortunate loss of life can be viewed as deplorable or a basis for renewal, depending on one's point of view and level of personal involvement. If I was a survivor in a small French village trampled by the Germans, I'd probably be eternally grateful for the American capability. I'm not, nor was I personally involved other than losing family as casualties, so my emotion is detached, as is my viewpoint.","hell-us-military","02:36 PM","government-debates","18"

The Romans brought with them medicine, science, art, philosophy, ideas, and numerous other advancements they would have take a great dealer longer to have appropriated on their own. Thats the good stuff. The United States has done much the same, try to share knowledge, bring medicine, etc... However, those nations whose history has been forever altered, whose to say how they would have developed? Worse? Better? Different? The only one we can be certain of is that they would have developed differently, but into what we no longer know. This is why I oppose what the Romans did, and what the United States is currently in the process of doing, because none of them are making a better world, merely one that suites their image of ""utopia"".","hell-us-military","04:08 PM","government-debates","20"

You are projecting colonialism on a country that saw the benefit of ceasing to be a colony. True, we had some ""possessions"" and we made a state out of Hawaii, but we don't invade and take over countries like those you mentioned. It's not easy to assess the size or exact value of our empire of bases. Official records on these subjects are misleading, although instructive. According to the Defense Department's annual ""Base Structure Report"" for fiscal year 2003, which itemizes foreign and domestic U.S. military real estate, the Pentagon currently owns or rents 702 overseas bases in about 130 countries and HAS another 6,000 bases in the United States and its territories. Pentagon bureaucrats calculate that it would require at least $113.2 billion to replace just the foreign bases -- surely far too low a figure but still larger than the gross domestic product of most countries -- and an estimated $591,519.8 million to replace all of them. The military high command deploys to our overseas bases some 253,288 uniformed personnel, plus an equal number of dependents and Department of Defense civilian officials, and employs an additional 44,446 locally hired foreigners. The Pentagon claims that these bases contain 44,870 barracks, hangars, hospitals, and other buildings, which it owns, and that it leases 4,844 more. These numbers, although staggeringly large, do not begin to cover all the actual bases we occupy globally. The 2003 Base Status Report fails to mention, for instance, any garrisons in Kosovo -- even though it is the site of the huge Camp Bondsteel, built in 1999 and maintained ever since by Kellogg, Brown & Root. The Report similarly omits bases in Afghanistan, Iraq, Israel, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Qatar, and Uzbekistan, although the U.S. military has established colossal base structures throughout the so-called arc of instability in the two-and-a-half years since 9/11.","gnojek","105619","Didn't we? Can't we do whatever we want with our military in that country and it was quite the launchpad for Operation Iraqi Freedom. If america is an empire, it is an empire of military bases. We trade ""protection"" for , let's say, a ""most favored status."" Don't we? Aren't we finally putting in our pipeline after wanting to for over a decade and fighting with the Russians and Argentinians over it? Now we OWN Afghanistan and we OWN the president, who used to work for the oil company that wanted to build the pipeline. He's OUR GUY. We keep trying to own Iraq, but those bastards are hard to keep a hold of, at least the testy ones. They just will NOT let us secure those oil fields, at least not all of them.
