We have taken the place of the Romans, but instead of conquest we use persuasion to the same effect, so that the world conforms to our idea of civilization. The politicans wield the lives of young men, some still freshly conditioned and properly indoctrinated, as that big stick which this nation likes to carry around. Like Nazi Germany our troops are indoctrinated on what it means to be an American, and some never even know they've been lied to. We are now what the Founding Fathers feared, we are what the Founding Fathers rebelled against, we are the new tyrants.","hell-us-military","11:41 PM","government-debates","1"

The US is in economic decline, for different reasons, but will, like Rome, expend our remaining wealth in fruitless attempts to rule by force. The lower class masses of many empires have always been marshaled by politicians using deceit as indoctrination. As I've posted before, strangely enough, there were no nazis to be found when Germany was conquered in WW2.","hell-us-military","10:39 AM","government-debates","2"

There are many historical examples of leadership driven by megalomania without using the Nazi connotation. And the same principles, or lack of, applied then as now. I think a major reason people are offended by 'Nazi' is genocide associated with Hitler's 'white' regime. While wholesale genocide wasn't uncommon during centuries past conquests, take a look at various Mongol or Goth excursions, the American Indian, Africa and Jews are the only examples of contemporary genocide. As ethnic groups, neither the American Indian or Africa were Caucasian and provoked virtually no public outrage. That left Caucasians mass murdering Caucasians, unspeakable in 'civilized' Christian Caucasian (hypocritical) society.","hell-us-military","04:33 PM","government-debates","7"

They were misled by their leader and they followed blindly, as a good soldier should. The same is true in Iraq. The soldiers think what they're doing is the right thing, some agree some disagree. Same as with the Nazis. The one thing I don't like is that we've gone into a foreign country who didn't have any threat to us and we put our version of a perfect government there. What if a dictatorship came and said they were going to change our government to a ""better"" government?","hell-us-military","11:59 PM","government-debates","8"

I know we don't take and claim territories ANYMORE. Can you deny that our military has been used often times to pressure other countries to submitting to our demands? That we use our politican, economical, and military influence to coerce others to suite our own interest? That many of those nations aren't pleased to have their arms twisted to do things that may or may not benefit them? Can you also deny that our military does not in its current size and state serve the purpose of protecting this nation and its citizens? When was the last time the United States was attacked on its soverign soil? Do you really believe 911 was unprovoked?","hell-us-military","12:33 AM","government-debates","9"

Its mostly bull, and does little to enhance our fighting ability. Our troops need to be able to question whether what they are doing is moral or not, not just have the mindset of I kill who or what I'm told. This I believe leads to the acts of genocide committed by the aforementioned Nazis. No they do not swear allegiance to an American fuhrer, but they are fairly strictly bound by law to do everything the Department of Defense tells them to. While it is not allegiance, it has a similiar effect, and whats the difference between one man and a council of men?","hell-us-military","12:40 AM","government-debates","10"

IMO the leadership desire for absolute conquest is present, with Fallujah and other zones displaying an appetite for brutality and domination, but lacking public support. Same as Vietnam, when we had in excess of 700,000 troops in that country and only China's threat with corresponding US public distaste due to media coverage for that undeclared war stopped our aggression. Hitler's political advantage was bringing a bankrupt nation back to solvency through a military based economy, achieving a heroic status, while US leaders have a fat, complacent public with mostly lower classes contributing cannon fodder on a volunteer basis. Make no mistake, this administration has a desire for conquest equaling that of past leadership of any empire, is facing economic hardship, but has the wrong timing to turn the public into an offensive entity.","hell-us-military","09:45 AM","government-debates","12"

And the aim of this manoeuvre, if my question isn't too crude or crass, would be an oil grab for the US and ""security"" for Israel presumably ? I can't think of an apt modern historical comparison demonstrating the US behaving in such a devious and amoral way in its foreign policy - unless you can cite Vietnam as being analogous in some way. My problem with this sort of scenario is that I'm an Americanophile (I just coined that word, but you know what I mean). I tend to believe without a very convincing case to the contrary, that America does and has done more good than harm in the world. Naive ? Well, possibly.","hell-us-military","12:15 PM","government-debates","15"
