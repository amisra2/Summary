Your #2 suggests that the US is being asked to intervene in the countries you name: who is doing the asking ? The UN ? Your #3 is a trifle simplistic: American support for authoritarian regimes isn't (or wasn't) a mere convenience. It is/was stimulated by geo-political analysis and reasons of state - which we would have to discuss on a case by case basis because American support for authoritarianism does not grow from a principled world view. If you discard ""racism"" as a motive for NOT supporting democracy in the Third World, can you explain, with more clarity, what other excuses you have in mind.","hell-us-military","11:10 AM","government-debates","46"

I would like to point out the following, one the attempt to spread democracy has been used before as an excuse to make a nation into something similiar to a colony or otherwise take advantage of a nation. Two, democracy may be a better system, but that doesn't mean that everyone in the world is ready for it, I can assure you the Iraqis certainly were not ready for the sudden transition. For the people of the Western world, Democracy has been present in one form or another, but for a lot of the other parts in the world, there hasn't been anything remotely resembling a democracy even on the local government level. Yes it seems like a simple concept to understand, but the difficulty of a democracy does not like in its being understood, but in its execution. If you've never had to shoot a gun before, how well do you think you would do? The basic premises of it are simple, point and shoot. However to shoot accurately, its more complex, and it takes time to learn, than after learning to adapt, then to refine. Often times this process takes a long time. Three, democracy isn't the only option of government in the world, and nor should it be the only one the world is limited to.","hell-us-military","05:24 PM","government-debates","47"
"06-11-2005","4760",4,"jim's trucking","None","You're exaggerating a bit. We're not marching out taking over countries and claiming them as ""ours"" as the armies you mentioned did. We're not into conquering countries to expand an Empire. We are presently the mightiest military force on earth and get called up as policemen and saviours now and then. Had we been the way you describe, we would have kept Kuwait as a prize, we would own Iraq and Afghanistan. You are projecting colonialism on a country that saw the benefit of ceasing to be a colony. True, we had some ""possessions"" and we made a state out of Hawaii, but we don't invade and take over countries like those you mentioned.","Matthew S","135876","I wonder how the native american population feels about this? esp ""We're not marching out taking over countries and claiming them as ""ours"" as the armies you mentioned did.""

I think thread came about as the Founding Father's did not want a professional military as they could be used by a tyrannical Government as a tool to oppress the populous*. Correct me if I am wrong, but they envisioned a citizens militia that would be used to defend the US from attack. Now we can debate if that was there intention, or we could debate that the times have changed and that you need to a professional military to function in the modern world. I agree that the title of the thread is a bit misleading, but look beyond the title and look at the content of the thread and you will see a rather good(IMHO) debate is being had by all with any resort to name calling and the like. *Those Founding fathers had good ideas, maybe the US should re-implement some of them . Such as there should be no political parties, everyone running for office should be an Independent.","hell-us-military","07:29 AM","government-debates","60"
