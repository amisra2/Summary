Do you think we should give foreign aid to countries? http://www.lp.org/issues/foreign-policy.html Libertarian foreign policy: Ending welfare for nations -- foreign aid BY MICHAEL TANNER Foreign aid is little more than welfare for nations -- with the same disastrous effects as domestic welfare programs. The U.S. currently spends approximately $14 billion per year on foreign aid -- far less than most people believe, but still a substantial sum. Since the end of World War II, the United States has spent more than $400 billion on aid to other countries. But there is little evidence that any of these programs has significantly improved the lives of the people in countries receiving this aid. Instead, foreign aid has typically slowed economic development and created dependence. Indeed, the U.S. Agency for International Development itself admits, ""Only a handful of countries that started receiving U.S. assistance in the 1950s and 1960s has ever graduated from dependent status."" In fact, despite massive amounts of international aid, the average annual increase in per capita GNP has declined steadily in developing nations since the 1960s, with many of the Third World's heaviest aid recipients actually suffering negative economic growth.","foreign-aid-should-we","03:43 AM","government-debates","1"

We support welfare here in the US. History is not always the best judge of future outcomes. Just because Israel survived once doesn't mean they are forever destine to succeed again. The survival of Israel is important to maintain a balance in the Middle East. Plus add to that the terrorism going on in that nation.

Someday we might have to go to war against Israel and we might regret the aid. It is possible that our support created resentment that helped cause 9-11. I have seen stories that say OBL said he attacked the US because of our support for Israel and our stationing of troops in Saudi Arabia. That is not my main argument against support. It is against my principles to tax people and give the money away.","foreign-aid-should-we","03:47 AM","government-debates","8"

I agree that welfare needs to be cut back substancially but eliminating it probably isn't the best answer either. Some people truly do need it during the hard times so they can survive and become productive again. What war? Who in the Middle East has been constantly at war? Anyways if you want balance see Israel destroying the Iraqi nuclear power plant in 1981. Talk about creating balance. The history is a good judge of future outcomes but logic is as well and to say that Israel is going to be able to survive another all out attack on them is not necessarily logically true. Perhaps we should end free trade with NAFTA as well. It benefits Mexico and Canada and one day they may be our enemies and we will regret helping their economies and opening business opportunities there. Is this your train of thought? Don't do anything that we may one day regret even if it seems likely that we are doing what is in our long term interest? Is it possible 9-11 could have happened even if we stayed completely out of international affairs? Absoultely. There is always someone who will be angry at the US regardless of what our policy is. Personally I disagree with only a few Libertarian policies but there are such major flaws in a few of them that they cannot possibly succeed if put into action on a wide scale. Taxing people and giving money away is one policy that works if done right. Our current system needs reform but eliminating the policy completely is not the answer IMO.","foreign-aid-should-we","10:23 AM","government-debates","9"

Welfare breaks up families and requires people NOT to work that are on it. Very bad IMHO. What War? Iran / Iraq / Israel / Egypt / Palestinians is what I was referring to. The only country in the region with Nuclear weapons is Israel. What balance is that? I have not evidence other than history and Israels current military which is more advanced than anyone in the region. Free Trade is different than outright giving money away. Free trade requires freedom. The foreign aid requires taxing the people where there is no freedom. Taxes are collected at gun point. Free trade is done with the absence of guns as a matter of principle. I agree with that. Some people will get mad because there is prayer in school. Others will be mad because condoms are handed out in school. Whenever the government collects taxes and spends it, it becomes a political football. I would recommend getting rid of public spending for the most part. We have been reforming the system since the system was created. IMO we are going in the wrong direction. We tax more and give away more liberty each year with the passage of legislation. Everyone wants their way. Some people want the government to give money to Nigeria, so we do. Others want to give money to Pakistan, so we do. Others want the government to give money to the Palestinians. American tax dollars are for sale. I heard just last night that some legislation was passed giving subsidies to some PRIVATE companies. Various groups are saying we should double our charity to Afghanistan from $150 per resident to over $300 per resident. Other countries are begging for more money too.

I'm sorry, but I find it a little too hard to believe. Some people will starve to death without welfare. Of course, it shouldn't be done in a way that exploits the government, but there is sometimes just no choice... About foreign aid, of course the US should continue. It's not just paying money to other countries. Do you want the US to be a pariah state? That is a bit snobish, naive and irresponsible. You don't want to ""spend"" your tax money? Are you willing to let millions of Africans die of starvation only because you want to live a better life (I don't know how much America is involved in Africa, but I assume they are)? Perhaps a bigger TV, bigger cars, bigger parking spaces..... Anyways, the US developes economic relations with countries around the globe as a result. For example, oil. Without paying money to Arab countries, you wouldn't be getting your cheap oil. About Israel... in 1948 Israel had won a war it had no chance winning. The only aid they received was from Yugoslavia I believe. The British helped training a few troops during the mandate years, but that's basically it. Israel won the war yes. But a new country usually gets aid from other countries in the world to help it develope. In 1956 another war was between Israel and Egypt. I don't think the US aided Israel much at the time. Only after that, and before the war in 1967 US aid started to really pump up, and Israel became a major power in the Mideast (until then Israeli military wasn't acknowledged as a strong force). Even so, in 1973, Israel almost lost a war - mostly because of arrogance and intelligence that failed. The US saved Israel that war. Israeli citizens would have probably been murdered to death if the US didn't help with aid. Anywho, you're forgeting the Cold War. The US had big interests aiding Israel as USSR was aiding Arab countries. The world is a complicated issue.... It's all I can say.","foreign-aid-should-we","04:41 PM","government-debates","11"

What in the world are you talking about? Tell me what wars you are trying to indicate are constantly going on. Also how are the Israelis nuclear missiles causing an inbalance? Iraq having them would have caused an inbalance when they went to war with Kuwait. Israel has way less people than any of their neighbors so even that can be viewed as unbalanced. But the only thing we are really testing for balance is the stability in the region. If we have stability then things are relatively balanced. Without Israel in the region I would find it hard to believe that there would be greater stability or balance. Playing the laws of probability and nothing more will show that evenutally history will not repeat itself and Israel will get defeated if an attempt to do so occurs often enough. Also don't forget that the arabs may gain alliance with European countries or the Russians and become much more of a threat to Israel. History cannot take that type of swing into affect. We were not talking about outright giving money away. We are talking about doing things that we may one day regret. Is it true that we may one day regret helping the Canadian economy by implementing NAFTA? Of course that is true. We may one day regret it. So should we call it off right now just in case we regret it later? Heck, I could take your original statement of ""Someday we might have to go to war against Israel and we might regret the aid."" and twist it by asking could we someday need Israel and be glad that we gave them aid in the past. There are always possibilities that something we do today could XXXX up in our face tomorrow so we don't take stupid risks. Supporting Israel is the right thing to do and it is not a stupid risk. And this will somehow prevent any further 9/11's or are you for some reason refering to my quote with something that has no real link to anything said in it? I agree with your first paragraph which is why I like many conservative policies as well as libritarian ones. However when it comes to giving money internationally I think if we were smarter about it we would have a better system but eliminating it is not the answer. That is the easiest way to solve a problem but it creates more than reforming the system would. Reforming would still allow the US to help people who really need it and gather goodwill in other nations.","foreign-aid-should-we","05:49 PM","government-debates","12"

You are talking the typical liberal speak. You want the government to help or take care of people. You think the government is just great dont you. What am I talking about? There seems to always be a war going on in the Middle East. Much of the time we are supplying the weapons. You call balance one side having overwhelming power over the other? That is silly. That is your excuse for giving taxpayer money to Israel? If you roll the dice enough the Israelis might lose? Sure anything is possible. I really dont care if they do lose. They are not part of the US. Why do you care? Why would we need the Israelis? Also, just because you have free trade does not justify foreign aid. There I no reasoning there. I looked back and in that quote you are referring to I did not mention 9-11. I mention cause and effect. If you smoke cigarettes there is a higher possibility you will get cancer. You cannot take taxpayer money, toss it around and expect nothing bad to come from it. According to OBL one of the two reasons for 9-11 was our support of Israel. Do you see the cause and effect? You want to give money away so they like us? Goodwill? Who cares if they like our government? It is not my responsibility. Plus, we seem to back some of the cruelest dictators at times. What reasons do you favor giving taxpayer money to other countries? You personally can give money; no one is going to stop you. But why force everyone to?","foreign-aid-should-we","09:12 PM","government-debates","13"

Check it out: http://www.lp.org/issues/welfare.html 1. End Welfare None of the proposals currently being advanced by either conservatives or liberals is likely to fix the fundamental problems with our welfare system. Current proposals for welfare reform, including block grants, job training, and ""workfare"" represent mere tinkering with a failed system. Like I said, you can spend your money on what ever you want. I gave money to help mothers left here while their husbands are in Iraq. This is the way charity should work: voluntarily. This is your idea of developing relations? We have to give them money? I like the free market. I dont like spilling blood so I can save a few pennies on oil. OR I dont like taking tax money and bribing people so the consumer can save some money. It is not the taxpayers responsibility. You are right. To think you can fine tune it with the exact amount of blood or taxpayer money is wrong. I like freedom, not the government bribing people (or countries) or threatening them.","foreign-aid-should-we","09:27 PM","government-debates","14"
