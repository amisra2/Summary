Do you think we should give foreign aid to countries? http://www.lp.org/issues/foreign-policy.html Libertarian foreign policy: Ending welfare for nations -- foreign aid BY MICHAEL TANNER Foreign aid is little more than welfare for nations -- with the same disastrous effects as domestic welfare programs. The U.S. currently spends approximately $14 billion per year on foreign aid -- far less than most people believe, but still a substantial sum. Since the end of World War II, the United States has spent more than $400 billion on aid to other countries. But there is little evidence that any of these programs has significantly improved the lives of the people in countries receiving this aid. Instead, foreign aid has typically slowed economic development and created dependence. Indeed, the U.S. Agency for International Development itself admits, ""Only a handful of countries that started receiving U.S. assistance in the 1950s and 1960s has ever graduated from dependent status."" In fact, despite massive amounts of international aid, the average annual increase in per capita GNP has declined steadily in developing nations since the 1960s, with many of the Third World's heaviest aid recipients actually suffering negative economic growth.","foreign-aid-should-we","03:43 AM","government-debates","1"

I agree that welfare needs to be cut back substancially but eliminating it probably isn't the best answer either. Some people truly do need it during the hard times so they can survive and become productive again. What war? Who in the Middle East has been constantly at war? Anyways if you want balance see Israel destroying the Iraqi nuclear power plant in 1981. Talk about creating balance. The history is a good judge of future outcomes but logic is as well and to say that Israel is going to be able to survive another all out attack on them is not necessarily logically true. Perhaps we should end free trade with NAFTA as well. It benefits Mexico and Canada and one day they may be our enemies and we will regret helping their economies and opening business opportunities there. Is this your train of thought? Don't do anything that we may one day regret even if it seems likely that we are doing what is in our long term interest? Is it possible 9-11 could have happened even if we stayed completely out of international affairs? Absoultely. There is always someone who will be angry at the US regardless of what our policy is. Personally I disagree with only a few Libertarian policies but there are such major flaws in a few of them that they cannot possibly succeed if put into action on a wide scale. Taxing people and giving money away is one policy that works if done right. Our current system needs reform but eliminating the policy completely is not the answer IMO.","foreign-aid-should-we","10:23 AM","government-debates","9"

The only country in the region with Nuclear weapons is Israel. What balance is that? I have not evidence other than history and Israels current military which is more advanced than anyone in the region. Free Trade is different than outright giving money away. Free trade requires freedom. The foreign aid requires taxing the people where there is no freedom. Taxes are collected at gun point. Free trade is done with the absence of guns as a matter of principle. I agree with that. Some people will get mad because there is prayer in school. Others will be mad because condoms are handed out in school. Whenever the government collects taxes and spends it, it becomes a political football. I would recommend getting rid of public spending for the most part. We have been reforming the system since the system was created. IMO we are going in the wrong direction. We tax more and give away more liberty each year with the passage of legislation. Everyone wants their way. Some people want the government to give money to Nigeria, so we do. Others want to give money to Pakistan, so we do. Others want the government to give money to the Palestinians. American tax dollars are for sale. I heard just last night that some legislation was passed giving subsidies to some PRIVATE companies.

I'm sorry, but I find it a little too hard to believe. Some people will starve to death without welfare. Of course, it shouldn't be done in a way that exploits the government, but there is sometimes just no choice... About foreign aid, of course the US should continue. It's not just paying money to other countries. Do you want the US to be a pariah state? That is a bit snobish, naive and irresponsible. You don't want to ""spend"" your tax money? Are you willing to let millions of Africans die of starvation only because you want to live a better life (I don't know how much America is involved in Africa, but I assume they are)? Perhaps a bigger TV, bigger cars, bigger parking spaces..... Anyways, the US developes economic relations with countries around the globe as a result. For example, oil. Without paying money to Arab countries, you wouldn't be getting your cheap oil. About Israel... in 1948 Israel had won a war it had no chance winning. The only aid they received was from Yugoslavia I believe. The British helped training a few troops during the mandate years, but that's basically it. Israel won the war yes. But a new country usually gets aid from other countries in the world to help it develope. In 1956 another war was between Israel and Egypt. I don't think the US aided Israel much at the time. Only after that, and before the war in 1967 US aid started to really pump up, and Israel became a major power in the Mideast (until then Israeli military wasn't acknowledged as a strong force). Even so, in 1973, Israel almost lost a war - mostly because of arrogance and intelligence that failed. The US saved Israel that war. Israeli citizens would have probably been murdered to death if the US didn't help with aid. Anywho, you're forgeting the Cold War. The US had big interests aiding Israel as USSR was aiding Arab countries. The world is a complicated issue.... It's all I can say.","foreign-aid-should-we","04:41 PM","government-debates","11"

What in the world are you talking about? Tell me what wars you are trying to indicate are constantly going on. Also how are the Israelis nuclear missiles causing an inbalance? Iraq having them would have caused an inbalance when they went to war with Kuwait. Israel has way less people than any of their neighbors so even that can be viewed as unbalanced. But the only thing we are really testing for balance is the stability in the region. If we have stability then things are relatively balanced. Without Israel in the region I would find it hard to believe that there would be greater stability or balance. Playing the laws of probability and nothing more will show that evenutally history will not repeat itself and Israel will get defeated if an attempt to do so occurs often enough. Also don't forget that the arabs may gain alliance with European countries or the Russians and become much more of a threat to Israel. History cannot take that type of swing into affect. We were not talking about outright giving money away. We are talking about doing things that we may one day regret. Is it true that we may one day regret helping the Canadian economy by implementing NAFTA? Of course that is true. We may one day regret it. So should we call it off right now just in case we regret it later? Heck, I could take your original statement of ""Someday we might have to go to war against Israel and we might regret the aid."" and twist it by asking could we someday need Israel and be glad that we gave them aid in the past. There are always possibilities that something we do today could XXXX up in our face tomorrow so we don't take stupid risks. Supporting Israel is the right thing to do and it is not a stupid risk. And this will somehow prevent any further 9/11's or are you for some reason refering to my quote with something that has no real link to anything said in it? I agree with your first paragraph which is why I like many conservative policies as well as libritarian ones. However when it comes to giving money internationally I think if we were smarter about it we would have a better system but eliminating it is not the answer. That is the easiest way to solve a problem but it creates more than reforming the system would.

Check it out: http://www.lp.org/issues/welfare.html 1. End Welfare None of the proposals currently being advanced by either conservatives or liberals is likely to fix the fundamental problems with our welfare system. Current proposals for welfare reform, including block grants, job training, and ""workfare"" represent mere tinkering with a failed system. Like I said, you can spend your money on what ever you want. I gave money to help mothers left here while their husbands are in Iraq. This is the way charity should work: voluntarily. This is your idea of developing relations? We have to give them money? I like the free market. I dont like spilling blood so I can save a few pennies on oil. OR I dont like taking tax money and bribing people so the consumer can save some money. It is not the taxpayers responsibility. You are right. To think you can fine tune it with the exact amount of blood or taxpayer money is wrong.

If you are to shield all the good or bad from any situation then the answer will appear apparent when infact you are only basing your answer on a very limited and bias information. If it is only ""liberals"" who believe you should look at both the good and the bad of any situation and try to remain unbiased then all hail liberals for they are wise indeed. However I don't believe this is the case. I don't believe this is a trait that belongs to just one type of politician. The government does help take care of people in case you haven't noticed. You are probably again only looking at the negatives and not the positives and therefore have concluded that it is only a dream that the government could possibly help a single person. So let me ask you, can you even admit that the government may have helped one person that you know in any way and can you tell me how this person was helped? Do the reverse as well and tell me how one person you know was hurt by the government just to keep this balanced. I asked for specifics. Can you tell me specifically what war is constantly ongoing or were you being a little dramatic a few posts back? Supplying weapons isn't unbalancing in itself. If a room full of people get supplied weapons while they are calmly sitting down and talking is the situation anymore unbalanced now than it was a few minutes ago? I'm not suggesting that the Middle East is calmly sitting down and talking but I am suggesting that supplying weapons isn't unbalancing in itself. You have to tell me how these weapons are causing an inbalance in the Middle East. As you brought up before Israel once had to fight off a massive attack against them by several enemies on several fronts on short notice. This was not a balanced war and Israel won so you probably agree because they won the war was out of balanced in Israel's favor. At this time however they were heavily out numbered and out gunned. So are weapons the only judge of balance? Also you probably realize that the world has not has a world war in almost 60 years now and in that time the US has become a massive powerhouse of a nation along with Russia. Our two countries alone could level the entire Earth with our weapons while no other nation can come even close to being in the same league as us. So how has this massive inbalance led to almost 60 years without a massive war while the 60 years before that had 2 massive wars? Let say you are in 5th grade and you have a brother who is in 2nd grade. Some bullies pick on him every day but eventually quit picking on him only because they know if they do again you will be there to defend him. But why should you defend him? He isn't you and you are in far less danger if you just avoid the whole situation right? So a day comes where the 2nd grade bullies are picking on him again, do you find any reason to help him? Do you help him if he is only a friend of yours? Do you help him if he is a friend of your brothers or a friend of your friend? How about if you had never seen him before in your life? I would hope that you are willing to simply stand up for what is right and not what is easiest. Using grade school playground terminology I think Israel is the 2nd grader and the US is the 5th grader while a bunch of bullies are looking to pick him the littler Israel. I don't think it is right and having recently been picked on ourselves this 5th grader isn't about to let the bullies have free reign over Israel. This is how I view the situation. How do you view it? Why do we need a 2nd grader? There are thousands more like them so why worry about just one? Is that what you are asking? You are hard to get through to sometime. We are not talking aid at all here. We are talking about things we may one day regret. We may one day regret NAFTA because it supported the Canadian economy. What if one day they become more powerful than us and turn on us. Do you think we could regret having ever been of any service to them? So should we end NAFTA now because it may one day turn on us? You also agreed that 9-11 would have happened if we stayed completely out of foreign affairs. It was not just cause and effect, it was inevitable. Cancer is not inevitable although it is likely regardless of cigarettes. How about do you see the cause and effect of the Arab nations rising up against Israel right now? They could either win or lose. If they lose they probably get nuked and world tensions rise. If they win the arabs now have nukes and many of them and world tensions rise. If Israel is simply attacked world tensions rise. Is there a cause and effect for the US pulling support from Israel? In my view there sure is but maybe you don't believe there is. Goodwill would be the result of helping people who need it. I wouldn't give money just to please people but I would please people anyways as a result of my actions. It also does matter that they like our government. If they were all to hate us I can see a cause and effect happening. You seem to not want to take responsibility for anything other than yourself. I would imagine a lot of your libratarian friends do the same. It really is a selfish form of government although selfishness does lower taxes. For the good of others and for ourselves. It is sort of like why people give money to the church. They do it and really get nothing in return except a goodfeeling of having helped an organization who will help others.

"11-17-2003","1233",2,"AMD4EVER","None","Liberal speak? I simply said you should view both the good and the bad of any situation. If you are to shield all the good or bad from any situation then the answer will appear apparent when infact you are only basing your answer on a very limited and bias information. If it is only ""liberals"" who believe you should look at both the good and the bad of any situation and try to remain unbiased then all hail liberals for they are wise indeed. However I don't believe this is the case. I don't believe this is a trait that belongs to just one type of politician. The government does help take care of people in case you haven't noticed. You are probably again only looking at the negatives and not the positives and therefore have concluded that it is only a dream that the government could possibly help a single person. So let me ask you, can you even admit that the government may have helped one person that you know in any way and can you tell me how this person was helped? Do the reverse as well and tell me how one person you know was hurt by the government just to keep this balanced. I asked for specifics. Can you tell me specifically what war is constantly ongoing or were you being a little dramatic a few posts back? Supplying weapons isn't unbalancing in itself. If a room full of people get supplied weapons while they are calmly sitting down and talking is the situation anymore unbalanced now than it was a few minutes ago? I'm not suggesting that the Middle East is calmly sitting down and talking but I am suggesting that supplying weapons isn't unbalancing in itself. You have to tell me how these weapons are causing an inbalance in the Middle East. Also you probably realize that the world has not has a world war in almost 60 years now and in that time the US has become a massive powerhouse of a nation along with Russia. Our two countries alone could level the entire Earth with our weapons while no other nation can come even close to being in the same league as us. So how has this massive inbalance led to almost 60 years without a massive war while the 60 years before that had 2 massive wars? Let say you are in 5th grade and you have a brother who is in 2nd grade. Some bullies pick on him every day but eventually quit picking on him only because they know if they do again you will be there to defend him. But why should you defend him? He isn't you and you are in far less danger if you just avoid the whole situation right? So a day comes where the 2nd grade bullies are picking on him again, do you find any reason to help him? Do you help him if he is only a friend of yours? Do you help him if he is a friend of your brothers or a friend of your friend? How about if you had never seen him before in your life? I would hope that you are willing to simply stand up for what is right and not what is easiest. Using grade school playground terminology I think Israel is the 2nd grader and the US is the 5th grader while a bunch of bullies are looking to pick him the littler Israel. I don't think it is right and having recently been picked on ourselves this 5th grader isn't about to let the bullies have free reign over Israel. This is how I view the situation. How do you view it? Why do we need a 2nd grader? There are thousands more like them so why worry about just one? Is that what you are asking? You are hard to get through to sometime. We are not talking aid at all here. We are talking about things we may one day regret. We may one day regret NAFTA because it supported the Canadian economy. What if one day they become more powerful than us and turn on us. Do you think we could regret having ever been of any service to them? So should we end NAFTA now because it may one day turn on us. You also agreed that 9-11 would have happened if we stayed completely out of foreign affairs. It was not just cause and effect, it was inevitable. Cancer is not inevitable although it is likely regardless of cigarettes. How about do you see the cause and effect of the Arab nations rising up against Israel right now? They could either win or lose. If they lose they probably get nuked and world tensions rise. If they win the arabs now have nukes and many of them and world tensions rise. If Israel is simply attacked world tensions rise. Is there a cause and effect for the US pulling support from Israel? In my view there sure is but maybe you don't believe there is. Goodwill would be the result of helping people who need it. I wouldn't give money just to please people but I would please people anyways as a result of my actions. It also does matter that they like our government. If they were all to hate us I can see a cause and effect happening. You seem to not want to take responsibility for anything other than yourself. I would imagine a lot of your libratarian friends do the same. It really is a selfish form of government although selfishness does lower taxes. For the good of others and for ourselves. It is sort of like why people give money to the church. They do it and really get nothing in return except a goodfeeling of having helped an organization who will help others. The government does force people to do this now unlike the church but you can see how the basic principle ties into the real world. Also personally giving money is not going to always go into the right hands either. Personally giving money to Africa in general doesn't always get to the specific location it is supposed to go to.

Personally, I would like the Federal government to leave me alone and dont try to help anybody, except removing people from society that commit force or fraud (in the US only). Just because the government does try to help people does not mean I think it is right. You are right, in the long run the government can NOT help people. Specifics. I have seen the Israeli / Palestinian conflict non-stop for decades. Besides I have seen many wars occur in the area besides that. How can there be an imbalance of weapons in the Middle East? Here is how: One side is supplied with a large quantity of weapons. There was mutual assured destruction (MAD). Who is the bully? Who has the most weapons the Palestinians or the Israelis? Should we arm the underdog? No way! I dont think it is right giving a second grader a gun. If the second grader then shoots people we would and should be held responsible. Or should we go in and send troops? Hey, if you want to go over and help people or send them money go ahead. Viewing government actions for the past few decades, I would say they backfire more times than not. Even those that dont backfire seem to at a later time. Israel, Nigeria, Columbia, Viet Nam are not part of the US. You can help them personally, but IMHO our collective should not. Well, in a way I do agree with you. I think NAFTA was unnecessary. We could have just lowered Tariffs. What does concern me is the governing body that NAFTA requires, without oversight from our elected officials. I do agree NAFTA was bad there. BUT, we never needed to impose tariffs or taxes on goods. This initial government action should not have taken place. Correlating to what we are talking about : We should not have imposed taxes in the first place then we would not need NAFTA. We should never have given aid to Israel then according to OBL 9-11 probably would not have occurred (also we should not have stationed troops in Saudi Arabia - the other reason for 9-11) I did not say 9-11 would have happened if we did not stay out of foreign affairs. I did say 9-11 happened while we were doing what YOU advocate, ie giving money to foreign countries. So your actions did not prevent 9-11. My opinion: We should have never given money away in the first place. It might have been sold to us originally as good intentions but this road to hell is paved with good intentions (have you heard that quote?). Yes, I think there will be negatives to pulling our support for Israel. Our politicians would probably receive less money in the form of contributions. But on the up side: It would save the taxpayer money or at least keep the money here. We would be resented less throughout the Arab world. Israel is not part of the United States. It does not concern me anymore than any other country. If you want to help, go ahead, IMHO. You call me selfish because I do not favor forced charity. I contribute money besides what I pay in taxes. And yes I am selfish. No one will care for my kids like I do. You dont do you? I need to feed and shelter my kids, not the world. No, in fact much of the money we gave in aid to Africa went to purchasing weapons. Good point. They cant do a better job. This is what you dont understand. Maybe you are little young, I dont know.

This is the way charity should work: voluntarily. This is your idea of developing relations? We have to give them money? I like the free market. I dont like spilling blood so I can save a few pennies on oil. OR I dont like taking tax money and bribing people so the consumer can save some money. It is not the taxpayers responsibility. How about some shoes for my kids. My sons have worn hand-me downs. We have shopped at the thrift store for my daughters dresses. Hey, if you have lots of extra money you send the government or foreign governments money. My kids are still young, so they dont seem to care. We are doing better now. But my feelings come from the decades of poverty I experienced. Mad and AMD, let me ask you both a question if you dont mind. Do you guys have kids?","Madhat","22972","Right. But not every person actually will spend his money on good causes. Your government knows what's good for you and your country (well.... not always, but I have faith in the good willingness of the US government). As a leading nation I think the US does have responsibility to help other nations. One of the biggest complaints the radical leftists had was the US sanctions opposed on Iraq. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi people died because of that. Let's not take that example to argue whether it was justified or not, but it shows that no one will just take his money and spend it on foreign aid. Why spilling blood? The US doesn't spill blood over Egypt, Jordan, etc. It's a two way benefit. Both sides can be happy with the income. So you do not care that Israel could've lost in 1973? You do not care that millions of people would have been slaughtered. What about WW2? If the US could send money to Europian countries to beat Nazi Germany you wouldn't support it? That way you wouldn't even have to go to war and get killed. Just make others powerful so they'll do the job for you. Anyways, you said Israel could survive on its own. You said Israel won before US aid ever came in. I showed you that that war (1947-9) was barelly won, and Israel almost lost another war (in 1973) with American aid. Do you think you will pay less tax if foreign aid will be cut? I am definately not an expert on these things and I do not know much about this stuff.

(rhetorical dont answer). Well, after they were sued by the justice department that all changed. They are now one of the largest contributors and the suit disappeared.

I'm glad you answered this way. You have shown your true colors and anyone who wishes to see this need only refer to post #18 where you made this response. I asked several questions which you didn't answer and you blatantly have shown that you are unable to admit that the government can possible help even one person when you have to know that it is true that they have. That is not a war. You said a war was going on. The balance to this is that the Arabs have sheer numbers advantages over the Israelis. It is balanced now because the Israelis have the weapons to fight against these numbers. So weapons provide balance as I have shown before. The Arabs would invade Israel if not for MAD but since Israel has these weapons the Arabs won't budge. Israel would invade the Arabs if not for Russia and Europe. So basically the weapons are causing balance even in this conflict. The bully is anyone who tries to invade another nation. Israel has been invaded over and over by the Arabs and ever since then they have been trying to prevent it from happening again. They are the ones being bullied and there is no debate about that. BTW, why not arm the underdogs if they are the ones who will need the help the most? Also I thought you said Israel was too powerful so why are they suddenly the underdogs? We never gave the 2nd grader a gun. We gave him training in karate at most. The gun equivilant to a 2nd grader would be giving a country many nuclear weapons. They are linked to the US however. I can see obvious reason to help Israel as I'm sure you can see as well but just don't want to admit it (per your 2nd quote in this post). You know you are wrong in this area but are too proud to admit it. So I guess the question now becomes why do you continue to defend something that makes no sense in your own head? Actually you should defend tariffs to the grave if you don't want us to somehow help another country that may one day turn on us. We should have massive tariffs in order to prevent any country from doing any business at all with us. We wouldn't want to sell someone something at a fair price if they may one day use it against us. Shouldn't that be your view? If we had just isolated ourselves from the world completely we could live in harmony. Lock down all borders and let no one in just in case we may regret letting them in later. Don't talk to the UN or NATO or any other country as me may regret talking to them later. Just how far are you willing to let your paranoia about regreting a future event go anyways? My actions have prevented another 9-11. You basically have no evidence of what ""your"" actions could do as no one has ever attempted ""your"" actions. Lets assume what you are saying here was the policy of the government before WWII. You are the president and the Nazi's are beginning to take control of Europe. You stayed so isolated that the Japanise never felt that the US was a threat so Pearl Harbor never happened. It is 1942 and England is about to fall and needs our help just as China is begging for help. China and England are not part of the US so does it concern you what is happening there as long as Germany and Japan don't do any physical harm to the US? Do you keep taxes low and not build up our military even if you don't plan on helping the fight overseas? This is the ultimate failure of your system of thinking. When something like this should happen you will have no good answer. Either you will go back on everything you have said and join the fight or you will sit back and await the fall of your nation and government. But based on your response to my previous questions I really don't expect that you would answer these questions either. I call you selfish because of quotes like ""Israel is not part of the United States. It does not concern me anymore than any other country"".

As for your kids analogy, I care more for others than you do as I care that Israel is not invaded and that people don't have to die in a bloody war there. You don't care at all.

You probably simply stop your caring once you reach our Northern border if not sooner. Exactly. Reform is necessary! They can't or won't? Of course they can do a better job but just don't know how to handle tracking where their money gets spent so therefore they just won't do this. If you don't believe that our government is good for our private sector then what do you believe is good for our private sector? The US didn't just become #1 in the world because we are the ""United States"". The government set up our economic system long before you were born.

Actually you are such an extreme liberal I dont know where to begin. Now you want to defend tariffs. I addressed this argument in the tax section of this forum under steel tariffs. You are the paranoid one. You are afraid and feel the solution is to give taxpayer money away. You can not prove your actions have prevented another 9-11. 9-11 did happen with your plan of meddling in place. You cannot deny 9-11 happened. You somehow believe a country or two can take over the world and control it. You are mistaken. No country can do this. We are in the best position of any country throughout history to do so and we get bogged down trying to control just a few or one for an EXTENED PERIOD OF TIME. The only method of controlling a country is to kill all of the inhabitants. We cannot control Iraq until all inhabitants have perished (control indefinably that is). So until you are ready to genocide populations, we will never win. This is the failure of YOUR system. Oh, because Israel has nukes we have to give them taxpayer money? You are silly. You say I dont care at all. Quit making things up to support your flimsy arguments. I said I dont care anymore about Israel than other countries.

Americans pay taxes that support our government. Until every American is taken care of, I don't feel our government has the right to give away our tax money. As far as israel goes, people have pointed out earlier in the thread that without our foreign aid, they could simply not survive. To me, this is the argument for discontinuing aid to israel. If a nation cannot survive except ont he generousity of america, thewy should not survive as a nation. Why should we pump billion a year into a country taht cannot survive on its own? If we are going to do that, we may as well make them a 51st state.","foreign-aid-should-we","02:43 PM","government-debates","26"

Isreal is a small minority that supports democracy, surrounded by a lunatic violent majority who dispises anythign relating to western political ideology. So obviously you help your friend in need. I on the other hand do not support lending money to kleptocracies like the many in Africa who are at the top of the international monotary fund's lending list (USA contributes 80% to imf). These same counties remain at the top of the poorest-contries-list written by the imf, allowing them to not pay back the money inherently turning lending into giving.","foreign-aid-should-we","02:44 PM","government-debates","27"
