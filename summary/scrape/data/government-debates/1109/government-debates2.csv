I think it's fairer to say that the media is biased against anything not ""middle-of-the-road"". Whatever they feel is an ""extreme"" position, they will regard as suspect. This goes as much for the ""left "" as for the ""right"". The only bias they have are anything that goes against their economic interests. If a position is marginal or extreme it might offend people who might then stop watching, boycott, withdraw ad money ( ) or otherwise cause problems. It is unimportant what is true, or what is left or right. They are just as unlikely to embrace an ""extremely liberal"" position as they are an ""extremely conservative"" one. That's why they love words like ""controversial""- it piques interest but says nothing.","epaphras_faith","20937","Not trying to touch the war, just that the media representation of it (for the most part) was far from accurate. Chritianne Amanpour was one of the worst offenders. You will note that her ratings were abysmal. She attacked the war and then it was reported later that she knew of tortures of Iraqi staffers and said nothing out of fear of reprisals. Then, after it is safe to criticise she still defends the government. i disagree, the media has an agenda that aggrandizes the liberal left leaning agenda as that is what will make money for them. It has to do with the ""feel good"" attitude.","should-government-lie-its-people-case-war","02:48 PM","government-debates","17"

I agree with epaphras_faith that it may be necessary to withhold some information like troop movements etc. But they should not withhold information for the sake of making the war look favorable.

Victory was always just a few months away and we were going to win soon. After years of dismal failures and being lied to, the people finally saw the truth, mainly by press reports and dead solders being shipped home in body bags. We are still trying to overcome that distrust today. A little truth would have gone a long way towards settling this terrible war and saving lives. A democracy only works when the people are informed. To say that the government should lie to the American people is to say that those people that were put in power by the people dont trust the people. And that is a slippery slope to a dictatorship. When we a fighting a war on the other side of the world, the people have a right to know why we are fighting and what are the risk and advantages. It could be a case where the politicians have made the wrong decision to fight a war. In that case, moral should be low so something will be done about a bad decision. When the people are told the truth and know their lives are in danger, you dont have to worry about moral, they will fight tooth and toenail to preserve their families.","should-government-lie-its-people-case-war","10:01 AM","government-debates","22"

It was a pointless war for the most part. If lying in the government leads to a dictatorship then you have to know that every politician today is leading us in that direction. Name one who doesn't lie. If you cannot, do you expect us to be a dictatorship soon? But what if America is where the war is? What then is your policy?","should-government-lie-its-people-case-war","10:19 AM","government-debates","24"

Now who determines when it doesnt go too far and when its worth it? Are you going to let the government or the people decide which war is pointless? BTW were you an adult during the Vietnam war? Politicians like everyone lie, some more than others. People lie to protect their own interest. I was referring to the government, which is not a politician but a collection of representatives. Fortunately the government is divided, as the founding fathers intended, and there is always a battle between what should be told and the lies as is evident more than ever today. If all the representatives get together and decide to lie to the American people as a group, then yes we will soon be in a dictatorship. I have great faith in the American system so I dont think we are headed in that direction. But I may be naive. My policy is to trust the people with the truth. Otherwise there is no oversight of the people over the government. And that is what the founding fathers warned us against.","should-government-lie-its-people-case-war","10:52 AM","government-debates","25"

We need to elect people with a brain to make the important decisions so that we never get into another Vietnam. No I wasn't even born when the Vietnam war was going on. The government is made up of politicians that lie. How does this not reflect at all on the government? Mix that in with the CIA and FBI and you have a lot of lies, half truths, and hidden events. No one should ever trust that the government is going to be honest about anything in the first place simply because they do not have to be honest. I also have faith in the American system because we are forced to be democratic by the other countries in the world. We know that a dictatorship would result in a fall in the production and importance of our country compared to the rest of the world. Therefore the government would not even consider a dictatorship because it would ultimately hurt them more than anyone else. So you would rather have lower moral and lower productivity in return for truth? Would you be at all upset if this decision was the one that swung the war the other way and we fell to a dictatorship? It seems strange to me that you love democracy so much but you are willing to allow our enemies to take advantage of our system of truth in order to destroy us. Does this not prove that democracy is ultimately going to fall due to itself?","should-government-lie-its-people-case-war","11:14 AM","government-debates","26"
"11-02-2003","1109",2,"mizmaxx","None","If the US was really a democracy, the government would not be able to lie at all. COINTELPRO, the Iran-Contra scandal, Watergate, Vietnam, and countless other things we still don't know about, none of these would have happened. If the government didn't lie, very few people would be going to attack Iraq, or wherever the ""target of the hour"" is. Democracy works. The US isn't a democracy, and it doesn't have a ""system of truth"", so the government lies to get people to do things for it, and will continue to do so.","AMD4EVER","21192","So you would trade what the US has right now in favor of risking everything for the sake of truth even if that means the future will never again know truth?","should-government-lie-its-people-case-war","11:54 PM","government-debates","28"
