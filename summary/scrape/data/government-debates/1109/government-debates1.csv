"10-12-2003","1109",1,"hermes","None","Just like the topic says-- please give me PRO mainly and some con if youd like.","AMD4EVER","19101","Pro - It keeps moral up and therefore production remains stronger and the war can better be supported. Con - The people won't know the truth and eventually may begin to stop trusting anything the government says. The pros outweight the cons in my opinion.","should-government-lie-its-people-case-war","01:05 PM","government-debates","2"

I believe very little of what our government tells us. I do however trust SOME of the media, and I think that the media is the majority source of where people get most of their information during a war. The media is more likely to be objective and report the good and the bad news. After all, it seems that the US media thrives on bad news lately, the more bloodshed and carnage, the more people want to watch.","should-government-lie-its-people-case-war","02:32 PM","government-debates","3"

The freedom of the press was originally put in place to keep the government in check and I think you are correct that it does provide more honesty than our government does. One thing I want to note is that one media source actually became more popular recently for providing the accurate news instead of the bad news, bloodshed, and carnage. FOX News was the station that gained the most popularity after the Iraqi war and they were the ones who were probably the most optimistic about it. Every other channel except FOX and MSNBC were pretty negative about it and at the end of the day we discovered that the best source of truth came from the optimistic networks and not the gloom and doomers. I think this little event showed that bad news will fall a distant second to honest reporting.","should-government-lie-its-people-case-war","02:42 PM","government-debates","4"
"10-16-2003","1109",1,"None","None","None","epaphras_faith","19605","US government aside, the question is should a government lie to its people in time of war. My answer, no. I do not have a problem of withholding information so long as it is not done in order to deceive but rather to protect others so that the information will not harm them. A government should be honest at all times. Especially the US government (getting back to the US), because it is a government of the people and people should be honest. When answering a question might hurt someone I vote it simply is not answered.","should-government-lie-its-people-case-war","04:33 PM","government-debates","5"

What if false hope will prove the difference between your enemies victory and your own. The governments job is more than to just inform the people. Their job includes protecting them as well and making decisions that will allow their citizens to live the best possible lives. If a lie is going to help protect the people by allowing moral to stay high and therefore keeping production efforts up and military support high then I think they are doing the right thing. I don't doubt that there are situations where we have been lied to and really shouldn't have been but I don't deny that there are situations where I would want the government to lie to us because it is what is best for the country.","should-government-lie-its-people-case-war","10:28 PM","government-debates","6"

Regardless as to whether we were winning or not this would probably help boost patriotism and work production at home. The work would then carry over into our war effort. Do you think this is probably true?","should-government-lie-its-people-case-war","02:36 PM","government-debates","9"

The governmental lie is too easily found out. Wars are very public events. Heck, even Clinton couldn't hide an affair with Monica Lewinsky. It caused him gain the dubios honor of one of the very few presidents to be impeached by the HoR. He got caught in a lie ""read my lips, I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Monica Lewinsky"" on national TV. He then later had to admit it as he couldn't hide it. Lies are only likely to demoralize. Not saying, isn't much better but our government sure looks better.","should-government-lie-its-people-case-war","04:11 PM","government-debates","10"
"10-18-2003","1109",1,"IcePrincess","None","I dont think the gov't should be allowed to lie to its ppl at any time what-so-ever. If the gov't lies to us during war, how do we kno they'll stop when its peace time? lieing can be addictive. if the ppl found out the govt lied to them, they'd never trust it again! they also wouldnt support anything goin on that the gov't had supported, includin that war. of course i dont believe anythin the govt says anyways, especially about the war in iraq and the so-called 'war on terrorism'. I agree with you fully on that! i do trust the media more than the govt","epaphras_faith","19897","IP: You are very cogent on this one. I suggest you rethink trusting the media before the government. Government is not a business. It is not out to make money. Should you verbatim trust the government? NO. However, the media is out to make money. They will and do lie. The worst part of it is that they pretend to be objective and just report the facts when actually they twist things by leaving out crucial information. For instance, I think it was MSNBC that ran an article that said soldiers were dissatisfied in Iraq. However, if you actually look at the poll you find that on one question they answered that they thought their units morale was low. About 65% I think. That is what was reported. They didn't bother to report that 67% of soldiers in Iraq report their morale to be good or better. They also didn't report the question that asked if the soldiers saw a reason for being over there. 66% said they saw a good or better reason for being over there. The media has a bias against conservative positions. Look for it. You will find it in most newspapers and TV stations. Fox News seems to have the most balanced reporting.","should-government-lie-its-people-case-war","03:40 AM","government-debates","13"

Sure there were no American troops in Bagdhad........ However, I am willing to believe only certain media outlets. Most network media I do not trust at all. For instance, the network media still attacks the war in Iraq as unjust. However, go to http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/relea...0030920-4.html and look up the anecdotal info on what was done to the Iraqi people by Saddam Hussein. It is page after page after page of reports coming from towns that had been liberated by the american troops. it is almost completely American media sources. They report these terrible stories and then still have the gall to say that the war was not justified. They are out to make money and to prosit an agenda. I hate that.","should-government-lie-its-people-case-war","05:53 PM","government-debates","15"
