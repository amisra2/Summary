I would, and do, do everything I can to encourage people to live democratically, and to encourage open and transparent democratic systems.","AMD4EVER","21229","I didn't say anything concerning the US being a democracy in my last question. All I asked is if you would risk what the US is today in order to hear the truth even if it means we could fall to a new order which will not tell us the truth ever again. Pretend it is the Cold War and communist Russia has invaded and look like they will win. Do you want the US government to try and rally the American people by making things look better than they are and giving them hope or do you want to know the truth and risk disheartening them and therefore risk having our government fall to communism?","should-government-lie-its-people-case-war","09:22 AM","government-debates","31"
"11-04-2003","1109",3,"AMD4EVER","None","Personally I would hope that the government would do what is in their best interest and what is in their best interests is going to be what is in the best interest of the country as a whole. We need to elect people with a brain to make the important decisions so that we never get into another Vietnam. No I wasn't even born when the Vietnam war was going on. The government is made up of politicians that lie. How does this not reflect at all on the government? Mix that in with the CIA and FBI and you have a lot of lies, half truths, and hidden events. No one should ever trust that the government is going to be honest about anything in the first place simply because they do not have to be honest. I also have faith in the American system because we are forced to be democratic by the other countries in the world. We know that a dictatorship would result in a fall in the production and importance of our country compared to the rest of the world. Therefore the government would not even consider a dictatorship because it would ultimately hurt them more than anyone else. So you would rather have lower moral and lower productivity in return for truth? Would you be at all upset if this decision was the one that swung the war the other way and we fell to a dictatorship? It seems strange to me that you love democracy so much but you are willing to allow our enemies to take advantage of our system of truth in order to destroy us. Does this not prove that democracy is ultimately going to fall due to itself?","Hank","21379","You need to do some reading about history and political science if you think what is in the best interest of a government is always in the best interest of the people. And you didnt address my question about who should determine when the government should start lying. We have exactly the same case right now in Iraq. Some people believe we should be there and some do not. Id bet you are on one side or the other. Only time will tell which side is right. Then you have no idea how much anger there was between the people and the government about lying to them. And politicians are made up of people. And people lie. That is why the government should be divided so that one part cannot get enough power to only give one side of an issue. If no one should ever trust the government, how does that fit in with your previous statement about electing people with a brain to make important decisions. No one forces us to be democratic. We fought a war to have the right to be democratic. I think you are very nave if you believe we can assume the government will never try to take power over the people. Every heard the saying Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely? I assume by lower productivity that you mean economic productivity. But during the Vietnam war productivity did not suffer any worse than any other time. In fact wars tend to stimulate the economy. But I reject your premise. You say that the only option is lying or lower moral and lower productivity. Point to me a case in history where that has been the case. Your premise is that the ends justify the means. If nothing else, my religious beliefs would reject that philosophy. All the great religious personalities taught against that. In addition you are stating that the American people can not handle the truth. That somehow we will just lie down and let someone run over us if we find out we are in trouble. To me thats a poor attitude and an inaccurate belief about people in general and the American people in particular. This weekend my little girls 7 year old soccer team, whom I coach, was behind towards the end of the last quarter and they didnt realize they were behind. There was a break in the action after the other team scored and as they were walking back to line up I hollered at them to come towards me right quick. I told them we were one point behind and that it didnt matter whether we lost by one point or 20 points. Then I told them everyone on the field except the goalie should attack as soon as we kicked off. We made two goals within two minutes and won the game. According to your theory, I should have said nothing to prevent them from being demoralized. Just keep the American people in the dark and let the government make the correct decisions? Not in this lifetime if I have anything to say about it. Ive seen that scenario and didnt like it. And neither did the American people at the time. Obviously the new generation has not read much history.","should-government-lie-its-people-case-war","08:16 AM","government-debates","32"

Did the event actually end up benefiting the government or the country? Would the government repeat this event? Who should determine when the government should start lying? Well since a government lie would require the backing of a whole lot of politicians and the people elect these politicians to speak on their behalf, I think the politicians in the government should be the ones to determine when the government should start or stop lying. If a single politician feels the government has gone too far then they should speak out the truth. If you really believe that democracy works then you have to believe the government can regulate itself based on the quality of people in the position of power. As for whether we did the right thing in Iraq or not, that is going to be determined by the people of Iraq. I've heard repeatedly that only 20% of the country is still providing resistance to our troops while the other 80% is relatively peaceful. If we want to talk democratically Iraq has already shown that it is ready to move forward from here and that means the building of a new government that is for the people. In the long run do you believe that the new government will be better for the people than Saddam was? Do you think that a government that is better for the people is also going to be better for the country? Do you also think that a government the is better for the country could end up influencing the people of the surrounding countries into realizing things can get better? I know the anger I felt for our governments incompetence after 9/11. However you are correct. I'm lucky that I am living in a time where I have no major reason to be angry about my government lying to me. The politicians all have agendas and most of those agendas include trying to get re-elected by the people who elected them in the past. Politicians who lie have to still keep in mind the people who they need to get re-elected as well as those who wish to run against them and bring up the lies they are telling. The government is actually divided because a title is given to their name and that title is either Democrat or Republican. If you take away the titles and take away partician lines you will have a less divided government. However you won't have the counter balances that you have today because of our two party system. It is probably beneficial for the government to be divided because it keeps the system honest. No one ever should trust the government. If people fall into just trusting everything the government says then the government will have free reign. We cannot trust the government enough to do that and of course since this is a democracy it is our right to say our piece on what the government should be doing. If we don't like being lied to then do what the people of California did to their lying and corrupt politician. This is democracy at its finest. Electing people with a brain is important to our system as well. Although you don't want to trust their every decision you still want them to be able to make good decisions. Keep a close eye on them regardless of how honest and smart they seem to be but if they really are a politician who is honest and smart they will only benefit our country and our government. No one forces us to be that was but world relations basically prevent it from changing to basically we are forced to remain the same. If we were to suddenly become communist or facist or a dictatorship it would have a ripple affect across the world that would hurt us in many ways and throw our system into chaos. I never assumed that our goverment will never take power over the people. I did assume that the government will do what is in their best interest and taking control of the people is not in their best interest at this time therefore it will not happen right now. Perhaps if situations change drastically they will have a reason to do this but as it stands today they do not have a reason to. Absolute power? Name the person in our system who has absolute power. Even our government has to make deal with other governments around the world therefore they don't have absolute power anywhere. In a democracy the amount of power the government has is even more limited because the people are playing in a role in the government as well. So if you believe the government has absolute power then I think you are misunderstanding our government. Productivity will generally increase during the time of war as you stated. Vietnam went on for a long time before the people even turned against the war. Check the stats for the last few years of the war to determine if productivity actually did drop when the people turned against the war. If you want a place where lying has worked, just look at the Cuban missile crisis. The truth was kept secret from the people of the US and the result was beneficial. I gather from your opinions that you don't believe in doing such things as this. You would rather know about the nukes in Cuba and allow panic to grip the nation and the people, who do have a say in our society, to be overtaken by fear and eventually begin protesting for war. The Cuban missile crisis is about as close as the US has ever been to being invaded and on this occasion the people of the US benefited from not being told the truth. Could it have gone the same way that it did if the people of the US knew everything that was going on? I really doubt it since the Russian government did not want to let anyone know that they were the ones that pulled out after pressure from the US. It would be losing too much face for them to publicly be humiliated. So would the truth have led to lower productivity and moral as well? Absolutely. I think you do misunderstand where I allow the government to lie to us. In Vietnam the war was far, far away and there was no reason for us to be lied to. I don't wish for those types of wars to include lies because the nation is not being threatened. However, if the war was ever to come to the US I would rather the government determine what they will tell us than have the government tell us every bit of information. Propaganda is what it is called and it has worked throughout the ages to benefit countries in times of war while hurting other countries. That is not my theory at all. If you knew that they were all going to die in 24 hours and they were having fun right now it is my theory that it is better for them to be allowed to have the fun they are having without having to hear the truth. My theory also includes that if you were to tell them the truth they would have less of a chance of victory in the game they were playing. Does my theory hold up in your mind? Once again you misunderstand my position. I never said keep Americans in the dark. I said keep them in the dark in the time of war where we are being threatened. This would include on a very specific event instead of a very general one. We haven't really been threatened for a long time and most of the times that we were threatened we have been able to tell the truth since victory was going to be ours. If we ever have a time where victory is not as assured and the moral and productivity of our nation will be important then I'd rather the government try and help the war effort in any way they can than to simply tell the truth about everything and not question whether or not it will hurt our war efforts or not. The war would be more important to me than anything because the war would be the difference between democracy and the United States being around tomorrow or not.","should-government-lie-its-people-case-war","11:04 AM","government-debates","33"

And I find it difficult to believe that there are people in the US that think there are cases where ignorance of government policy is a good thing. But Im going to stick with this debate for at least a little while longer. Ive already stated Vietnam. The lies allowed the ones in power to be reelected. If we had know the truth, they would have been thrown out at the next election and the people would have been much better off. And most politicians will continue to repeat this event if it gets him/her reelected. I believe that democracy is the best form of government that we have at this time. But I do not trust the government even though it is a democracy. Therefore I do not believe the government can regulate itself and I certainly dont HAVE to believe it can regulate itself. Iraq MAY be ready for democracy if you mean democracy for the male gender. I seriously doubt women will be given the right to vote in this society. And if its like Iran, which it looks like its headed in that direction, the religious leaders will have the final say even in a democracy. I have no idea if the new government will be better for the people than Saddam was and neither does anyone else. Thats not a question for the US though. Its their country, and if they are not threatening us then its up to their people what kind of government they have. Youre government lying to you should be a major reason in itself. And you want to justify this in some cases? It doesnt keep the system honest just because its partisan. It does allow the people to see both extremes and try to read what is actually the truth. You just got through say that you have to believe the government can regulate itself. So which is it? Do you really think that California elected someone that is not corrupt or going to lie to them? Germany was a democracy and no one had absolute power before Hitler took over. It has happened and can happen again. Productivity rose about 2.5% each year in the 50s and 60s and about 1% in the 70s and 80s. Do you attribute the 1.5% decrease over the 20 year period to the Vietnam war? I have no idea what you are talking about and apparently you dont either. I was a junior in high school and it was on the front page of every paper in America. I just looked and the lead story in the Washington Post was Kennedy Orders Blockade of Cuba As Reds Build Nuclear Bases There; U.S. Will Sink Defiant Arms Ships. The whole front page was covered with articles relating to the story. And there was no panic. People did not run in the streets and become overtaken by fear or begin protesting for war. The workforce did not shut down and schools were not closed. Of course people were concerned as well they should have been, but there was no panic. So according to your own example, the truth did not cause any demoralization of the people. Maybe youd better pick a different example. Well you dont allow the government to lie to us, they just do it. You cant pick and chose when you want the government to lie and when you dont want them to lie. You dont tell children fearful things because they are not mature enough to handle it. And I trust parents a million times more to have the interest of their children at heart than I do the government to have the interest of the people at heart. If they were going to die in 24 hours, there would be no game to lose as their parents would not even have them playing so your theory doesnt hold up in my mind. On the other hand, were talking about the government intentionally lying to the American people when the government thanks they should. No I understand your position perfectly. But the most important time the people should know the truth is when they are threatened. That is the most critical time when a dictatorship can take root. Look at history and see when our freedoms were the most restricted and challenged. Its always during time of war. But if you want the government to keep you in the dark during critical times, you wont get any argument from the government. So just keep that philosophy that you need protection from the truth because you might panic if you knew the truth. And by the way, be sure and teach your children that it is okay to lie when you consider it expedient. But dont be surprised when they lie to you to stay out of trouble on the premise that you would have panicked if they had told you the truth so they were just protecting you from yourself.","should-government-lie-its-people-case-war","09:47 AM","government-debates","37"
