This is always been the original meaning of Article 4 Section 1. So DOMA was worthless there. As for the other part which sets the standard for federal government, I'm not sure it violates the constitution since it is only for federal purposes.

I forgot you don't believe gay people should be able to marry in the first place. If couple A and couple B get a marriage licences from the state of Iowa then the Federal government and the other states can not under the federal constitution say that couple A's license is valid but couple B's is not valid.

Equal protection under the law means exactly that, not one set of laws for people in state-sanctioned relationships, and another for singles and everyone else. The only approach that is constitutional is for government to get out of marriage, and the only approach that is equitable is for the government to get out of marriage. Why don't you just admit this and move on?

Basically it prevents circumventing the law. First off, states honoring other states licenses would be Article 4 Section 1...not the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. In fact, you might say it violates equal protection to validate gay Iowa marriages in Illinois but not validate a gay marriage in Illinois. With that said I still think that misses the point of the equal protection clause. So in either instance your argument fails. Because equal protection of the laws means something different than what you think it means. You always forgot ""of the laws"". You can't give someone 15 years in jail for stealing because they are gay and 5 years because they are straight. For the millionth time, I don't worship the ""literalicy"" (sic) of the constitution.
