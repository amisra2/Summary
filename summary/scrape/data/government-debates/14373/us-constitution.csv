Basically it prevents circumventing the law. First off, states honoring other states licenses would be Article 4 Section 1...not the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. In fact, you might say it violates equal protection to validate gay Iowa marriages in Illinois but not validate a gay marriage in Illinois. With that said I still think that misses the point of the equal protection clause. So in either instance your argument fails. Because equal protection of the laws means something different than what you think it means. You always forgot ""of the laws"". You can't give someone 15 years in jail for stealing because they are gay and 5 years because they are straight. For the millionth time, I don't worship the ""literalicy"" (sic) of the constitution.
