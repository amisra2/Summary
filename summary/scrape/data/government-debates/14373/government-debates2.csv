The privileges or immunities clause therefore doesn't apply. Neither would the 14th Amendment, since there is no federal right to marry, either.","Matthew S","405489","You all are missing the point. Iowa has one license for everyone. The state of Michigan is saying that it will recognise couple A but not couple B when couple A and B have the same piece of paper. I do not understand why you all can not see this as treating couple a and b unequally.","us-constitution","05:37 PM","government-debates","16"

I have a license to drive from California. The state of Nevada recognizes my state's license to drive, but it doesn't have to. Nevada can legally take away that recognition, or assign conditions to it. You're confusing equal protection and equal treatment. If your act of murder, for instance, violates the murder laws of two different states, one which has the death penalty and one which doesn't, you can be extradited from the non-DP state to the DP state, where you would face the death penalty. You cannot turn to the 14th Amendment for help.","us-constitution","06:39 PM","government-debates","18"

Why shouldn't it? For example, let's say California starts issuing driver's licenses to illegal aliens. (It won't happen in a million years, but let's just say for the sake of argument that it does.) Nevada says it will recognize only those California drivers' licenses that correspond to legal residents of the United States. That would be perfectly legal. I'm all for gay marriage but it doesn't follow that every state would have to recognize them.","us-constitution","02:13 PM","government-debates","23"

It is essentially meaningless and inapplicable in modern life, like the 7th Amendment. If the privileges and immunities clause were actually enforced, state laws would simply not exist. Everything would be federal. There would no no state liquor laws, no state age of consent laws, no criminal statutes on the state level -- zip.","us-constitution","02:17 PM","government-debates","24"
