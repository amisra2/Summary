"06-25-2006","8291",8,"dugman_74","None","Learn to read.","daewoo","219055","Lets try it this way. What exactly would you like me to read? You posted that if we revamped our social programs we could pay off our debt in short order. George pointed out that even if we cut the cost of our social programs in half, we would still not be able to meet our deficit, much less pay off our debt. You went off on a tangent arguing that people were misrepresenting your argument and because George stated that a reduction in services would be imminent. You then posted a link to a health care plan that I showed conclusively would cost MUCH more than our current government funded health care solutions. Then you claimed that we could MAKE money with Social Security. You did not back that statement up AT ALL. So what have I failed to grasp? What I see is an unintelligent person with mental problems (your insistence that you are a genius, given the circumstances, is indicitive of EXTREME delusion) spouting off at the mouth with nothing to back it up at all. Not only do you lack any data, you do not even have a marginally cohesive argument. NUMBERS PLEASE","there-goes-democracy","11:24 PM","government-debates","115"

Claims to be an entrepreneur and then says someone who has actually built a successful business can't read. I think what we have here is some teenager off for the summer who is tired with playing with himself and is way over his head trying to argue with grownups. Dealing with puberty is probably taking precedence over any real attempt to support his statements, compelling him to resort to ""can't read"" in a childish attempt to regain his/her lost creditability.
