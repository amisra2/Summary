You advocated reforming social programs to help pay the debt. George pointed out that even if we managed to cut social spending in HALF, it would not even begin to cover the deficit, much less pay anything on the debt. Instead of admitting that you made a patently stupid statement, which everybody else seems to realize, based on ignorance and lack of data, you threw a little temper tantrum, claiming that otheres were willfully misinterpeting your words. Face it, your claims of being a genius ex marine are looking shakier with every post. You might revise that to ""mildly retarded high school student"" We might buy that Here is a link to the 2005 GAAP report for the government: http://www.fms.treas.gov/fr/ I do note I made a mistake earlier. Net liabilities for social isurance programs (Social security) alone are $46 trillion, and that is in addition to the $8 trillion in bond debt, so JUST THAT is a $54 trillion debt load. That does NOT include medicare or other unfunded federal liabilities, which total $30-$60 trillion. In my earlier post I said ""such as Social security and medicare"" when I should have said ""not including social security and medicare"", though meidcare SHOUDL be included there, social security should NOT.","there-goes-democracy","06:52 PM","government-debates","40"

That's the nature of the beast. Pick any number or percentage of reduction and apply that to reduction of current deficient spending. That still doesn't leave anything for retiring debt, even if you eliminate all social services. You claimed: ~Actually, our debt could be paid down in a short period of time if the government would reform its social programs and the health care industry.~ My post suggested a discussion regarding the cost of civil unrest after determining the budgetary impact of reducing the cost of social services. You still haven't defined how reducing social services will allow debt retirement.","there-goes-democracy","06:58 PM","government-debates","41"

My posts in this thread have been nothing short of brilliant and nothing you or anyone else has said can prove otherwise. In my absolute brilliance, I said to REFORM these services. I never said anything about cutting the funding in half. Until we properly reform them, we will not know exactly how much the costs will decrease. Therefore when either of you say anything about civil unrest by cutting them in half, you are making a patently stupid statement. You are assuming that the people of the US do not have the mental capacity required to actually reform health care in such a way as to make it possible for the people who live here to be able to afford their own insurance coverage. You are assuming that Social Security cannot be reformed in such a way as to become self sufficient. You are assuming that things cannot be changed that in fact can be changed. You are assuming that the government actually needs to take on these burdens when in fact it does not.","there-goes-democracy","07:01 PM","government-debates","42"

In the real world, maximum efficiency gains on these programs is only around 10%. George and I neither one suggested a number for dealing with civil unrest, so that is factored out of the calculations, though George is correct...decreased funding = decreased benifits = increased civil disorder. We were both polite enough to let this slip by without attaching a number to it that might shake you out of the fantasy land that you seem to be in. If more than 14% of americans were on medicare, MAYBE you would have a point. Since that is not the case, you are just makig noise. Again, assuming that we manage to reform away half of our social program expenditures, we would still not erase the CURRENT DEFICT, much less be able to retire any debt. SO WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING TO COME FROM TO PAY OFF THE DEBT? You clearly state that we could do so in short order. SHOW US HOW.","there-goes-democracy","07:18 PM","government-debates","45"
