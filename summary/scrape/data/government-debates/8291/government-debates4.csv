At 50% you are already outside the realm of adminsitrative costs completely and into base benifit costs. AND, since it has already been shown that even reducing the programs 100% would not leave any leaway for retiring debt, where is that funding going to come from?","there-goes-democracy","07:35 PM","government-debates","47"

The same health care reform will cut down the cost of medicare. How this is done is explained at the following site: http://www.healthtransformation.net/home/ Significant decrease to the budget. Social security could be turned into a money making system. No more burden. These are two very simple examples. There are many others that can be changed, such as education. Add that and other reforms to a tax system that allows more investment back into US companies while allowing the poor to keep more of their money, and you are finished. The improved economy should supply enough revenues to pay the bills. Oh yeah, we also have to stop pork spending, I did forget about that minor detail.","there-goes-democracy","07:44 PM","government-debates","48"

The same health care reform will cut down the cost of medicare. How this is done is explained at the following site: http://www.healthtransformation.net/home/ Significant decrease to the budget. Establish a national health insurance market that gives individuals the freedom to shop for insurance plans across state lines (through the Internet or by personal agent). Pass the H.R. 1872 to extend Health Savings Accounts to low-income Americans by providing eligible families up to $1,000 in direct contributions, along with a $2,000 advanced tax credit to purchase a High Deductible Health Plan. Individuals would receive up to $300 in their Health Savings Account and receive up to $700 in an advanced tax credit to purchase a High-Deductible Health Plan. Make insurance premiums for High-Deductible Health Plans tax deductible. Pass the Bush proposal to provide tax rebates to small businesses that contribute to their employees Health Savings Account (up to $500 per family or $200 for a single employee). Allow 100% rollover of funds in flexible spending accounts Social security could be turned into a money making system. No more burden. These are two very simple examples.

Any potential savings is offset by direct subsidies. I owuld suggest you learn to calcualte costs before throwing your weight behind programs that do not support your rediculous hypothesis: Also, has it not occured to you that what you are proposing here is to scrap government health care for 14% of the population in favor of a government takeover of the entire health care field and government contrived insurance for 100% of Americans? Your logic here is mind boggling. Exactly HOW is this going happen? how are you goign to turn SS into a money maker...espsecillay since we are as of right now nearly $50 trillion in the hole? Perfect 1950s thinking, when demand for expansion capital in the US was high. Now it is flat. Extra money floating around is not going to help US companies because they really don't have anything to spend it on. Itnerest rates have been at emergency lows for 10 years and that has not spurred corporate growth because US compnaies are uncompetitive. The only thing that can MAKE US companies competitive again is an across the board slash in standard of living for US workers, which is an idea that is met with some resistance (weird, I know). You have still only shown vague, unworkable, and rediculous. I am still waiting for genius.","there-goes-democracy","07:57 PM","government-debates","49"

According to that site, the subsidies will remain in effect for poor people. Nothing indicates that the number of poor people is expected to decrease.

Neither president had ANY idea that woudl turn SS into a moneymaker. They were BOTH just trying to come up with a band aid to put on that broken arm. I did read it.
