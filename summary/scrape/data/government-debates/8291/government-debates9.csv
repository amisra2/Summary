"06-26-2006","8291",9,"Dono","None","Claims to have been a Marine. In my time in the Corps, I never met even one man who shot off his mouth and retreated as quickly as Ol '74. Claims to be an entrepreneur and then says someone who has actually built a successful business can't read. I think what we have here is some teenager off for the summer who is tired with playing with himself and is way over his head trying to argue with grownups. Dealing with puberty is probably taking precedence over any real attempt to support his statements, compelling him to resort to ""can't read"" in a childish attempt to regain his/her lost creditability. Dono","daewoo","219377","His homepage is http://www.monavie.com/ Monavie runs a pyramid scheme (multi level marketing for the optimistic). Their product is a stinky fruit juice (I mean it smells bad) made from some funky berry from the amazon. It costs $45 per bottle and comes in what looks like a wine bottle. I have a bottle on top of my refirgerator that some friend of my wife gave me as a ""trial bottle"". If anybody wants fruit juice from the amazon that smells like baby ####, PM me and I will send it to you. I don't know much about the company, but it sounded like the standard MLM pitch to me. If it was me, I think I would have picked a pyramid scheme with either more products or a broader range of products. I just don't see fruit juice that smells like baby XXXX being that marketable, especially at $45 per bottle heading into an economic downturn. I generally avoid MLM like the plague, since there is volumes of data out there that shows that about .05% of participants make a lot of money and the rest jst end up poorer and ticked off.","there-goes-democracy","11:53 PM","government-debates","121"

Them guys are dumber than a bucket of hair.","jazyjason","222501","Lol, you know Lincoln was a Republican. So was Reagan, so is Roodey, and so am I. If I am as ""dumb as a bucket of hair"" then why do I take the time to answer your post. Heh maybe I am dumb by wasting my time fending off liberal dogma, but what the hey. Oh and FYI ""them"" is NOT a proper way to start a sentence if you want to make yourself seem unredneckish. Hooked on phonics worked for me too. Oh, and love does die because obviously the bitter sweet relationship with the ""glory days"" of the Clintion era were ousted by the majority of the country in the 2000 election.","there-goes-democracy","01:53 AM","government-debates","125"
"07-15-2006","8291",9,"danjrush04","None","I understand we ""voted"" to put the (edited) in charge of the country, but the point is there is no democracy as he was pretty much was self appointed to assume the roll as president because the makes a great puppet. You'd have to be an idiot not to think that Florida was in fact not rigged in any way, not to point out that his brother is actually the govern of the state. I believe Bush's' parents are quoted saying ""Bush was never the smartest one"". It just shows you that a country that can put someone to lead our country that cannot even pronounce words correctly is going no where but down. If this country wants to stay a super power longer we need to start to flush the XXXX down the toilet and get rid of a lot of greedy, corrupt, ignorant people in our government system. To answer your question democracy is going down the toilet as we Americans let the government take away more and more of our rights. I do agree Democracy is the best of the worst governments but still we need to get rid of the grim in the system.","jazyjason","222502","OK, you do know that Bush graduated form Yale. That his test scores were kigher than Kerry or Gore. Also, Gore wa sin the bottom five percent of his class. If you think that someone who studders is an idiot, or is incapable of normal thinking then I believe either A. you are incapable of being tolerable to people with disabilities, B. slippery slope is NOT in your vocabulary, or C. your facts come from a newsletter written by Michael Moore. Godbless Holly wood and Brokeback Mountain. Now THAT is good old family programing. Oh and ignorance is not being an idiot. No one taught Bush how to run a country, to deal with 9/11, to deal with foreign policy. Bush thought what he was doing was in the best interest of the nation at the time. That is why he acted upon intel from the CIA,MI6, and Russian intel. The fact is Bush was on the defence after 9/11 and acted upon a ""plausible threat"" to our nation. Now if Saddam DID have WMD's (which I believe are under 30ft of sand as well as that Mig the marines found), and he did harm a country or our own country, or sold them to terrorists who used them on American cities, then all u liberals would be ####### and complaining that Bush did nothing. So in my opinion your damned if you do and your damned if you dont.","there-goes-democracy","02:00 AM","government-debates","126"

Of course that's true for most politicians including Kerry and Gore. Bush got a C average if I recall correctly. That's not good. I believe someone admitted that the WMD threat was fabricated and that Bush knew it. Next.","there-goes-democracy","01:19 AM","government-debates","127"
