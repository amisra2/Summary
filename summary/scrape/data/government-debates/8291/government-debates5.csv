OR, explain your argument, including numbers, not just idiotic references to programs that you apparently do not understand.","dugman_74","218365","You did no such thing. Please learn to read and get back to me.","there-goes-democracy","08:35 PM","government-debates","61"
"06-21-2006","8291",5,"dugman_74","None","You did no such thing. Please learn to read and get back to me. Establish a national health insurance market that gives individuals the freedom to shop for insurance plans across state lines (through the Internet or by personal agent). Pass the H.R. 1872 to extend Health Savings Accounts to low-income Americans by providing eligible families up to $1,000 in direct contributions, along with a $2,000 advanced tax credit to purchase a High Deductible Health Plan. Individuals would receive up to $300 in their Health Savings Account and receive up to $700 in an advanced tax credit to purchase a High-Deductible Health Plan. Make insurance premiums for High-Deductible Health Plans tax deductible. Pass the Bush proposal to provide tax rebates to small businesses that contribute to their employees Health Savings Account (up to $500 per family or $200 for a single employee). Allow 100% rollover of funds in flexible spending accounts","daewoo","218368","Ok, tweedle dumber, I will quote from the site AGAIN: Low income families recieve $1000 in direct contributions, $2000 advanced tax credit (refundable) Individuals recieve up to $300 in HSA and $700 advanced tax credit PLUS, a tax rebate for small businesses, $200 per individual or $500 per family. NOWHERE does it imply that these subsides are temporary and if you dig a little deeper you will find that they FAR outstrip what we currently spend on medicare. THAT IS FORM THE SITE YOU LINKED. Maybe you should try reading your OWN site before commenting on it. Face it, you are a gold fish swimming with the sharks here.","there-goes-democracy","08:48 PM","government-debates","62"

If you think that that number is higher than what the government spends on health care, you are absolutely nuts. Are you going to tell me that the government spends less than $1k for the health care of the poor right now? Keep reading.","there-goes-democracy","08:55 PM","government-debates","63"
"06-21-2006","8291",5,"dugman_74","None","Are you aware that you have contributed nothing to the debate because you don't know what you are talking about. 1) People with brilliant investment skills are currently investing into US companies. 2) When you save those companies money by relieving their tax burdens, you allow them to re-invest those funds back into the companies. This is basic information.","georged","218370","Back to your original statement about repositioning social services to cut government operating costs to a point where those savings would retire debt. Numbers please, or I'll consider my interest in this thread completed.","there-goes-democracy","09:01 PM","government-debates","64"

Wait...no...Warren Buffet is moving his funds offshore and Paul Volker is estimating a 95% chance of a dollar crash within the next 5 years. You need to take a long, hard look at a capital influx report. Capital influx is slowing as foreign investors take a look at our economy and say ""I'll pass"" or ""not on your life"". Even foreign central banks are pulling thier reserves out of dollars and transferring them to more promising currencies. Our current stock market is basically composed of institutional traders churning comissions by trading what amounts to government subsidized retirement accounts. We are in a world of trouble here.","there-goes-democracy","09:09 PM","government-debates","66"

This is because the majority of folks on medicare do not actually require any medical care over the course of the year. By contrast, this program would allow subsidies for 30% of the population based on the ""low income"" criteria, with that 30% expanding to nearly 45% over the next decade as the middle class continues its move to the lower end of the income spectrum. In addition to this, nearly the small business provision would generate pay outs that cover roughly anotehr 20% of the population, though it would be a smaller payout and there would be some crossing of the 2 groups. So, once again, simple math exposes you for the flim flam man that you are. I am with George here. If you cannot provide anything approching a realistic argument backed by numbers, I am done here. All you have posted is stupidy with no substance to it whatsoever.","there-goes-democracy","09:16 PM","government-debates","68"

Then we can get on to what level of civil unrest cost to prepare for based on reduction of care for the crippled, poor, disadvantaged and pure lazy we've created who are dependent on government aid. I need your numbers to define your position on that cost. That would be a superior research project.","there-goes-democracy","09:18 PM","government-debates","69"

Beyond medicare and medicaid, what governemtn programs exist that pay medical costs? Unless you are going to claim that we are spending a couple trillion on VA med per year, this is just more of your ignorant rambling.
