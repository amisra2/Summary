The numbers cannot be proven until the actions actually take place. You have made some assumptions and said some things that simply aren't true. I have no use for a debate to be judged. From what I have seen in here, I would not want some of the members of this forum to be on my jury. I would like to know why you seem to be against making a real attempt at fixing broken systems though.","daewoo","218420","Maybe if you understood how formal debate here works. First, there are several judges. You pick some, I pick some. Then we agree on a format, then I kick your butt. It is very simple. Ad far as what the programs woudl cost...that is easy to calculate. First, find the number of families that fall under federal guielines for ""low income"". the information is available fromthe Census office or the GAO. Then multiply it by the subsidies set forth on your page. Then do the same for individuals and small businesses. It is really quite simple. That will give you the cash expeditures for benifits (and already exceeds medicare by nearly 3x). Now take that cash payout number, multiply it by .48, then add the result to your cash payout number. Now you have the program cost in benifit payouts and the cost for administration. It is really quite simple. You do not seem very bright for a genius. If I asked you what it would cost to give $100 to 10 people, could you figure that out? Do you think that they pass these programs with no idea of what they will cost? Heck no. It is easy to figure out what they will cost in most cases. Benifits per person x number of beneficiaries + admin costs. There is also a one time implementaiton cost that is calculated seperatly. Again, unless you can come up wiht some numbers, this is over and your concession is noted.","there-goes-democracy","11:06 PM","government-debates","76"

For a start, Daewoo and George know their economics so if you're going to argue with them you're going to have to use numbers. Secondly, the fact that you have not once attempted to do this suggests that you do not know what you're talking about. Thirdly, if ""you cannot prove the numbers that will come from anything I have suggested"" then the numbers are no use to anyone are they? Finally, ""The numbers cannot be proven until the actions actually take place"" is the single most bizarre assertion I have ever heard.

And it is very obvious from our current exchange that you would not kick anyone's XXX. I really don't know how you would debate an issue when you claim to read something and then make statements that are not congruent with what you have read. Here is yet again an example. You gave numbers using what you claim are federal guidelines. I will not challenge that the guidelines are correct due to the fact that it is irrelevant. The site does not state anything about using those guidelines. Therefore your numbers are wrong. You are also dismissing the fact that he lists numerous other ways to help make insurance affordable for lower income people which means that it is entirely possible that a much smaller percentage would need the assistance that it discusses. You are also forgetting the other issues that would help to make our economy stronger which very well may help even more people afford proper coverage.

If I leave the computer, or do not look busy, I will have to play ABC go fish. I haev played it at least 50 times in the last couple of days.

Low income levels are set by multiple organizations (education, state, etc..) the one that matters here is set by the SS administration, and for a family of 4 it is $38,700. Maybe some people won't need the help? What does that have to do with it? Accordin to the proporsed legislation on your site, we give every low income family $3000 per year minimum. You really think that they are going to say ""no thanks, I don't want that $3000""? Get a clue. Do you know how many EITCs have been rejected to date? ZERO. Not a single one. I am certain that not all the people who got them NEEDED them, but people take free money. End of story. You are right, it does list various ways to make insurance affordable, which would ensure that the $3000 the government gives you is enough to cover it.","there-goes-democracy","11:33 PM","government-debates","82"

"06-21-2006","8291",6,"dugman_74","None","And that has nothing to do with the conversation. Get a clue. You don't know what it's requirements are to qualify. Establish a national health insurance market that gives individuals the freedom to shop for insurance plans across state lines (through the Internet or by personal agent). Pass the H.R. 1872 to extend Health Savings Accounts to low-income Americans by providing eligible families up to $1,000 in direct contributions, along with a $2,000 advanced tax credit to purchase a High Deductible Health Plan. Individuals would receive up to $300 in their Health Savings Account and receive up to $700 in an advanced tax credit to purchase a High-Deductible Health Plan. Make insurance premiums for High-Deductible Health Plans tax deductible. Pass the Bush proposal to provide tax rebates to small businesses that contribute to their employees Health Savings Account (up to $500 per family or $200 for a single employee). Allow 100% rollover of funds in flexible spending accounts Again, nothing to do with this conversation. That's twice in one post. Um, no","daewoo","218442","The requirements to qualify are listed in the proposed legislation: Low income is not some buzz word. It has a real, legal meaning. I have explained that meaning. Counteirng the idiotic idea that some peopel may not accept the money if they don't need it. Do you see a phase out in the payments based on cost of insurance?

I wander through occasionally and read posts, but have not had much time to respond. I could not resist when this guy informed us that he was a genius and an Ex marine. Ex marine I could buy since entry requiremetns for military service are minimal in the US, until I looked a little closer and noted that he sounds a lot mroe like a high schoool kid with a hard on for the marines than an ex marine. I figured if there was a genius in our midst, I would check him out. I am horribly disappointed. The definition of ""genius"" being used must be one that I am unfamiliar with. Using the definition here, my dog may well be a certifiable genius. I hope your exams go well. I think that a lot of the folks here still in school are either finishing up exams, or enjoying the drinken care free days of summer. I am guessing that JP is busy with his new business. George should be getting moved into his new house and he has some summer projects (I think). Hopefully folks will be back in the fall and the 4forums sommunity will egt back together. I am not impressed with the quality of some of our new recruits. Some are ok, but some are just dumber than dirt. I grow weary of humiliating the mentally deficient.
