I know of some dictators that said the very same thing. Wait though there is more. George W. Bush ""Don't bet on American politics forcing my hand, because it's not going to happen,"" he said. ""I'm going to make decisions not based upon politics but based upon what's best for the United States of America."" He wasn't kidding when he said ""I'm the decider"" What's best for America? Do you really think killing and angering the entire middle east is best for America? If so I'd assume you'd think building a fence between America and Mexico is a splendid idea also! Also lets put up so web cams so Americans can spend all day trying to protect America from Mexicans. I swear if I had any power and I could fire or discharge the idiot who came up with either the fence idea or live web cams I would do it in a second.

George Bush was I believe elected by a majority. It is then for him to carry out the policies he has decided on. This I believe is subject to your Senate & House of Representatives (all elected) going along with him. Note they are your representatives not your agents. If you don't like it vote them out next time. In UK of course we have our own worries on that score as an Act of Parliament is being considered which would allow Ministers to extend the life of Parliament thus not needing an election. Naturalyy they would never dream of doing any such thing, even though some years ago a Labour Minister actually proposed such a thing.","there-goes-democracy","07:04 AM","government-debates","2"

Since the voting system is corrupt just like the ones in power we really do not choose who is in power now do we.

You'd have to be an idiot not to think that Florida was in fact not rigged in any way, not to point out that his brother is actually the govern of the state. I believe Bush's' parents are quoted saying ""Bush was never the smartest one"". It just shows you that a country that can put someone to lead our country that cannot even pronounce words correctly is going no where but down. If this country wants to stay a super power longer we need to start to flush the XXXX down the toilet and get rid of a lot of greedy, corrupt, ignorant people in our government system. To answer your question democracy is going down the toilet as we Americans let the government take away more and more of our rights.

I now live in Palm Beach county. I had the pleasure of standing in line with the people who screwed up those ballots. They had no idea what or who they were voting for. I actually had to tell several of them about the Constitutional amendments that were on the ballot. Bush won Florida in 2000. He may have lost if the ballots had been counted according to the will of the people who voted. But since there are laws that prevent votes from being counted if the person votes for 2 different presidents, Bush won. He won according to the ballots that were cast in a fashion in which the will of the voter could be determined. If the will could not be determined, that ballot was not counted. These are the facts, there is no evidence to the contrary. On the next point, what rights have you lost?","there-goes-democracy","11:34 PM","government-debates","8"

YES, our debt is a lot differnt than it has been during other wars. For one, we did not go into other wars already carrying an unsustainable debt burden. Second, the debt taken on during this war is more than the debt taken on during WWI and WWII COMBINED. There is an easy to follow chart at http://www.cedarcomm.com/~stevelm1/usdebt.htm that shows the debt since WWII (1938). Then national debt did not even hit 2 trillion unitl the mid 80's. Bush has already boosted it more than that on his own, and he is not even done yet. We fought the entire Korean war, a much larger action than this current fiasco, with very little increase in public debt. We fought the entire vietnam war, also a much larger military action, with very little increase in public debt. In order to compare our current debt load to any other wartime debt load with a straight face, you have to go back to WWII or WWI. Even then, you have some serious problems in that the comparison only holds if you use either percentage of GDP or percentage of increase, since in real dollars this debt load is much larger than both of those increases. The theird major differeince is that in both of those cases, our future ability to pay off our debt was very high. Going into WWII, we were well aware of the fact that WWII would be a massive economic boom for the US because we would have the only intact industrial infrastructure on the planet when it was over. There was great attention paid to this on all levels. There are multiple articles and scholarly papers written before and during the war that are dedicated primarily to the anticipated impact of the war on future US economics and all indicate a bright future. They were right. We basically went into both WWI and WWII secure int he knowledge that teh debt we were incurring was essentially an investment in US economic expansion. there was no question in either case that the post war economic climate would allow us to pay off our debt or at least grow our economy to the point that the debt was insignificant (which is in reality the same as paying it off). Today, we have squandered our industrial infrastructure. There is little or nothing left of it. Oru economy is turning and the XXXXX in the white house is charging on the national credit card like there is no tomorrow and there are, as far as I can see, no plans, as far as I can see, whatsoever as to how we are goin to pay down this record deficit expansion.","there-goes-democracy","12:22 AM","government-debates","15"

That does NOT include medicare or other unfunded federal liabilities, which total $30-$60 trillion.

Dono","daewoo","219377","His homepage is http://www.monavie.com/ Monavie runs a pyramid scheme (multi level marketing for the optimistic). Their product is a stinky fruit juice (I mean it smells bad) made from some funky berry from the amazon. It costs $45 per bottle and comes in what looks like a wine bottle. I have a bottle on top of my refirgerator that some friend of my wife gave me as a ""trial bottle"". If anybody wants fruit juice from the amazon that smells like baby ####, PM me and I will send it to you. I don't know much about the company, but it sounded like the standard MLM pitch to me. If it was me, I think I would have picked a pyramid scheme with either more products or a broader range of products. I just don't see fruit juice that smells like baby XXXX being that marketable, especially at $45 per bottle heading into an economic downturn. I generally avoid MLM like the plague, since there is volumes of data out there that shows that about .05% of participants make a lot of money and the rest jst end up poorer and ticked off.","there-goes-democracy","11:53 PM","government-debates","121"

You'd have to be an idiot not to think that Florida was in fact not rigged in any way, not to point out that his brother is actually the govern of the state. I believe Bush's' parents are quoted saying ""Bush was never the smartest one"". It just shows you that a country that can put someone to lead our country that cannot even pronounce words correctly is going no where but down. If this country wants to stay a super power longer we need to start to flush the XXXX down the toilet and get rid of a lot of greedy, corrupt, ignorant people in our government system. To answer your question democracy is going down the toilet as we Americans let the government take away more and more of our rights. I do agree Democracy is the best of the worst governments but still we need to get rid of the grim in the system.","jazyjason","222502","OK, you do know that Bush graduated form Yale.

No one taught Bush how to run a country, to deal with 9/11, to deal with foreign policy. Bush thought what he was doing was in the best interest of the nation at the time. That is why he acted upon intel from the CIA,MI6, and Russian intel. The fact is Bush was on the defence after 9/11 and acted upon a ""plausible threat"" to our nation. Now if Saddam DID have WMD's (which I believe are under 30ft of sand as well as that Mig the marines found), and he did harm a country or our own country, or sold them to terrorists who used them on American cities, then all u liberals would be ####### and complaining that Bush did nothing.
