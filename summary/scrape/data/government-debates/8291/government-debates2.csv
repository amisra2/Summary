It's still less than 3% of our GDP.","georged","218200","The ability to service and retire is the major difference in past and present debt circumstances. We're (USA) strained to service existing and continually expanding debt with an abnormal payment imbalance and declining industrial production. A classic migration from industrial to service economy with complete fiscal irresponsibility. For those who feed on the propaganda of published, self-serving government numbers, I suggest subtracting SS and Fuel Tax Trust funds diverted to general revenue, deficit and supplementary spending and debt service from GDP before calculating any specific percentages. Then total state debt not tied to a revenue stream (that deficit spending also being a major contributor to GDP) for an even more realistic, sickening percentage. The US now has one major product, USD being sold under threat by the world's largest and most expensive military to service expanding debt we can never hope to retire.","there-goes-democracy","09:06 AM","government-debates","16"

Do the math on paying down the debt vs tax revenues Revising our tax code would bring back our manufacturing jobs? How do you figure? We lost our manufacturing infrastructure because we were not competitive, primarily due to our wages and an unsustainable standard of living being demanded by our workers. Now it is actually GONE. It is not just a question of opening factories back up. We have to actually build new factories and retool them. In order to rebuild our industrial infrastructure to the point it needs to be, we would need to expend 10-18 trillion dollars, which we don't have. Please, explain how revising our tax code is going to provide 10-18 trillion EXTRA dollars as well as change the mentality of millions of Americans so they are willing to work for wages that are competitive in the international market. If anything, we need to adjust our tax system to required increased revenue collection during times of increased spending as opposed to our current system where one party can cut taxes as a vote buying scheme, while at the same time buying MORE votes by increasing spending.","there-goes-democracy","03:40 PM","government-debates","18"

If social services annual funding of $650-billion was cut in half, that would reduce current administration deficit spending, including supplementary funding deficits, to about $300-billion a year. Please explain how debt would be retired by reducing social services while abnormal deficit spending goes unabated with a tax revenue stream increasing only due to monetary inflation. I'd also be curious as to how a restructuring of the income tax program would stimulate a service economy which requires very little domestic investment capital. Then we can discuss national civil unrest derived from cutting social services in half and what the expense would be to control that issue.","there-goes-democracy","06:03 PM","government-debates","25"

And THAT is assuming that we managed to cut by half without having to double or triple law enforcement expenditures in order to deal with the civil unrest that traditionally comes with adding more starving people to the population. Mor einvenstment in US business? Demand for expansion capital has been flat for nearly 10 years now. Lack of invetment capital is NOT the problem. tHe problem is that no matte what kind of business you build, you cannot keep it unless you are competitive, and we are no longer competitive. We canot compete when US workers expect to make an upper middle class wage to do jobs that chimps could do. We cannot be competitive as long as every XXXXX with a bachelors degree believes they should be welcomed to increasingly unsustainable layers of middle management, and that it is their duty to prepare space for the next generation of graduates with middle management dreams. For somebody who is addicted to research, you seem to posess few or no facts and have drawn some conclusions that are WAY out there in lala land","there-goes-democracy","06:31 PM","government-debates","29"
