"04-05-2005","4737",1,"None","None","None","pandion","104307","How does a document that begins with ""We the People of the United States..."" apply to international law? I think that your question is badly stated. I may adopt either position towards the Constitution without any opinion on international law - mostly because the Constitution doesn't affect international law. In spite of what our President may believe, our Constitution is the Constitution of the United States - not of France, Great Britain, Afghanistan, or Iraq. But if the question is whether the Constitution is a living document? Then yes. If not, why the provisions to amend it? Times change and the amendment process allows the Constitution to change with them. Moreover, it is the job of the courts, the ultimate opinion coming from the Supreme Court, to interpret the meaning of the Constitution as it applies to every age. In fact, the sole function of the Supreme Court is to decide constitutional questions, not matters of law. So yes, the Constitution is a living document since the functions of the legislature to amend the document (with approval of the states) and the function of the Supreme court to decide what it means are included in the original document. But there is nothing about international law.","constitution-views","01:30 AM","government-debates","2"

For example, if I am getting your meaning, I think Strict Constructionist would be a better term than Originalist. In any case, as a rule, I do not agree with the strict constructionist view. It causes problems. For example, strict constructionists tend to believe that we are only guaranteed rights that are explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. This was why quite a few delegates to the constitution did not want a bill of rights in the first place because they felt that someone in the future would attempt to limit people to only those rights.","constitution-views","06:08 PM","government-debates","9"

It doesn't say that we can't ban abortion, the penalty or any such measure. Besides, you've clearly contridicted your argument. To rule based upon the consitution is to interpret it to deal with today's situtations , that is not a strict literal view. To have such a strict application one needs the very esscence, feelings and intensions of the writers. You cannot litterally apply something that is intensionally vague. Yet we lack other things they might have felt, thought, wanted and so on and so forth. Scalia's #1 intension is to make Divine Law US law. Scalia himself is interepreting the consitution how he feels when he makes a ruling. He's not applying a strict view himself.","constitution-views","04:25 PM","government-debates","11"
"04-06-2005","4737",1,"Steeeeve","None","How so you ask? Because laws about abortion, death penalty, and many of the other ""issues"" were on the books at the time of the constitution and or amendments. The idea is that when an amendment is written, say the cruel and unusual one, we apply what it meant then. Then it mean't a lot of things, hanging and what not. So in the future why would it all of a sudden mean something different? It doesn't. In fact to change what is cruel and unusual you would have to tell congress to get rid of the death penalty. So you are applying it to today situations, but these situations are by no means new. The ones that are..thats a different story. Abortion, death penalty, homosexual sodemy are not new at all. I would like to see some evidence of this.","Duo_Maxwell","104883","So they are therefore changing the consitution to suit what they need? How is that a literalist practice when the consitution is changing from time to time? It's not. Yet we can change this. Doesn't that imply the consitution is therefore a living document, able to change as the needs arise, and therefore NOT a originalist? Where per se, does the constution or ammendemnets talk specifically about the death penalty, abortion or other such issues? IF we were to apply it literally, we could not apply such measures or act upon them since they were not mentioned in the document. Therefore, any application of such is using the consitution as a living document.

"04-11-2005","4737",2,"Steeeeve","None","I don't understand what you are saying...the constitution doesn't change unless amended...and this should be the only way. Changed by amending...not by judges. Once again you miss the idea of the living document and the originalist theory...if we based what you are saying then we couldn't make any call on abortion or the death penalty because nothing in the constitution says so. However, it doesn't have to be in the constitution...remember the judges look at law. Death penalty and what not were law. They were law when the 14th amendment and below were written. The idea is that when cruel and unusual punishment amendment (8th) was created it didn't limit the death penalty because no law was struct down because of it then...so why so many years later does it mean something different? You ask where in the constitution does it mention these things...it doesn't, but they existed during periods of writting the constitution. Therefore they are not new ideas. The constitution can therefore be applied to them. A ""strict"" view of the constitution is what you are referring to by saying abortion and what not do not exist in the constitution...this is different from originalist. Finally, that link didn't prove anything but that Scalia is in fact an originialist..","Duo_Maxwell","106291","Then if the consitution is amended, it is changed to deal with modern cirucmstances. How is that applying a original view of the consitution when it is being fitted for the modern world? But you just said it was being changed. How can it be origanlist when it is being scripted for modern needs? Hence why the consitution is a living document, because such acts were ruled legal on the basis of a interpretation. Thank you for agreeing with me. I don't understand why you are aruging for a living document while arguing aganist. your argument specifically notes that the penalty was seen differently then, legislated different, and has since changed. How is that a origanlist when the intepretation of the 8th has evolved? Then you contridict yourself. A strict literalist/origingalist application is to apply the consitution specifically as it says. No if any or butts. How so? The link was to show how Scalia is attempting to make Divine Law US law, which you asked for.","constitution-views","09:04 PM","government-debates","17"
"04-11-2005","4737",2,"Steeeeve","None","Are you really asking this?...Because it was amended. Orginal view when it was written...if the amendment is written in 1992..then you look what it meant in 1992 because this is what the people that created it thought it should do. Do you really not know what originalism and living constitution(ism) are? lol, just because they aer ruled a certain way doesn't make it the right way it shoulda been done....if a judge said no free speech what so ever, would this be legal too? You seem confused... I am arguing against a living document. no where was I arguing for it... I said the 8th amendment means what it meant when it was written..unless a law changes that...it will remain today. And it proved nothing other than Scalia is an orginalist...not to mention the insane outta context quotes. For the final time (and please listen)...and Orginalist is different form the strict constitution theory. Orginalist believe that a law means what it meant when it was written...I always give this example: When the 8th amendment was written cruel and unusual included children under 18, hangings, etc.","Duo_Maxwell","106314","Then under such logic, any time a ammendement is added, the consitution gains new grounds. A nonliving document cannot grow or change. A living one can. I don't understand why you are arguing for and aganist at the same time. It would appear you do not. Well, that would specifically go aganist the bill or rights. It's a bad analogy. What I am talking about is specifically how the consitution was interpreted to mean different things at different times. Slavery was allowed under the consitution. Yet now it is not. Interesting isn't it how the consitution, seemingly a dead document has changed to fit the needs of the specific time. Seems pretty living to me. On the contrary, you clearly argue that the consitution can be ammended, that it can be changed. You also talked about how the views of the 8th ammendement changed over time. How can a dead document be applied in various different interpretations if is not living? so why so many years later does it mean something different? Well, you clearly show that it DOES mean something different. IF the document was non-living, then it could not mean something different. Therefore, you are clearly supporting claims that it has changed in its meaning without a ammendement. It wasn't trying to. It was a response to your request for evidence about Scalia and Divine law. Please read before posting. Alright. wait a minute. Are you arguing that we should apply a Orginalist view or that the consitution is a non-living document? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Originalism","constitution-views","10:11 PM","government-debates","19"

The first ammendment makes no mention of state law, only what congress can do. I could be totally wrong, but I have challenged a few people (none lawyers) to prove to me that there is such a thing as ""freedom of religion"" or ""free speech"" in the United States according to the consitution. There are no such guarantees. The original wording's purpose was to keep from interfering with states' rights. If a state wanted to restrict speech, then let them, as long as congress wasn't involved (according to the wording). But, using a ""living consitution"" interpretation, the supreme court has ruled numerous times that, say, teaching creationism in public schools is unconstitutional. They say things like ""The Establishment Clause forbids the enactment of any law ""respecting an establishment of religion"" ."" http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwa...lard.html#Held But it doesn't say that. Only if judges re-write the 1st ammendment does it say that. I missed Antonin Scalia. He spoke near here on Monday. I've heard he doesn't like to announce where he'll be speaking. Too bad I missed it. I think he said he was an originalist. He must be against free speech.","constitution-views","07:26 PM","government-debates","22"

I will now wait for your response about what judicial power is...and after you mess that up I will proceed to correct you because judicial power doesn't mean the power to say laws evolve other time...So lets just cut that out right now. Just tell me what is the basis for a living constitution? In fact let me just list out my questions: 1) What basis is there for the living constitution? 2) How is ruling on something that uses public opinion not legislating? 3) How does a legal document have its words change without actually changing the words. 4) What criterion do the judges follow with the living constitution? Those are few that have never (and will never) be answered.

I merely said that the consitution was vague and that the founders were not origanlists. I suggest you read it carefully next time. Judges can strike down laws. They cannot make them. Even in the gay marriage argument, Judges can only strike down bans, they cannot force new laws into existance. The only people who can legislate are those who are in the legislature. I'm still disturbed you asked this. It's basic knowledge of how the government works. Society does, or some major event. It is true in many aspects of life. gay as happy is a archeic term, the english language is full of them, it's just evidence that words change meaning. Legal documents can have their meanings changed. What was previously ruled cruel and unusual changes meaning, as we have seen with the death penalty in the 70s. Precedent can be changed. One can set a new precedent which then may or may not be followed. My answer is unchanged. Self proclamation of incoherenace does not make it so. Also, your inability to read properly doesn;t help your case either. You ignored two key words: starting point As I have said before, a precedent may or may not be followed. it merely is the starting point.

It's living because judges with that philosophy have been in power for quite a while. Scalia said something about 'it's more interesting to talk about policy than to talk about the letter of the law' and 'judges who follow the living document philosophy have more power.' But anyway, there is no originalist/living document conflict with the ""cruel and unusual"" bit. The terms ""cruel and unusual"" are there to be interpreted. Adjectives can sometimes be subjective. The interpretation of these terms can change. The phrase ""Congress shall make no law"" does not have much room for interpretation. It means pretty much what it says. The original intent was to make room for states' rights. The framers didn't leave that same room in the other ammendments in the Bill of Rights. They used language like ""the people's rights wrt to this and that will not be infringed."" Why would they go through so much trouble to word the ammendments the way they did if judges can just come along and interpret them so loosely that they mean something that they don't say?","constitution-views","05:24 PM","government-debates","35"

Years ago, it was common to treat kids worse than adults (they should be seen and not heard) and if they were bad, they were beaten not scolded. Nowadays, the legislative branch (NOT JUDGES) has passed laws saying that beating is child abuse, and the general public has a little more respect for kids. Instead of objects, they are thought of as people. Another law is that kids under 18 aren't held accountable for most actions. I'm pretty sure most minor crimes get erased from your record at 18 and they aren't considered fully responsible until they are 18. They can't enter legal contracts, other punishments are shorter (key part here) and they don't have as many rights. Since under most laws (written by the legislative branch) kids aren't held accountable (or as accountable) for their actions, punishments are shorter, and they are thought of as people, they ruled that it was cruel and unusual punishment to kill kids under 18. You can probably find the majority opinion somewhere on the internet, but I doubt you'd read it if I found it for you, so if you want it find it. The internet is a wonderful thing.

"04-18-2005","4737",3,"zachvac","None","I can explain the death penalty bit. Years ago, it was common to treat kids worse than adults (they should be seen and not heard) and if they were bad, they were beaten not scolded. Nowadays, the legislative branch (NOT JUDGES) has passed laws saying that beating is child abuse, and the general public has a little more respect for kids. Instead of objects, they are thought of as people. Another law is that kids under 18 aren't held accountable for most actions. I'm pretty sure most minor crimes get erased from your record at 18 and they aren't considered fully responsible until they are 18. They can't enter legal contracts, other punishments are shorter (key part here) and they don't have as many rights. Since under most laws (written by the legislative branch) kids aren't held accountable (or as accountable) for their actions, punishments are shorter, and they are thought of as people, they ruled that it was cruel and unusual punishment to kill kids under 18.

The funny part about your post is that the case involving the death penatly of minors happened only 15 YEARS ago...and the judges didn't even say that case was wrong...just our standards of deceny have changed. HAHA Zachvac you are a trip man.","constitution-views","11:01 PM","government-debates","38"

The Act is facially invalid as violative of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, because it lacks a clear secular purpose. The Establishment Clause forbids the enactment of any law ""respecting an establishment of religion"" (4). The Act violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because it seeks to employ the symbolic and financial support of government to achieve a religious purpose.","gnojek","109406","Another example is when the Supreme Court struck down state laws that force teachers to teach creationism in class. Without the living interpretation, they could not have said: Instead of reading the plainly stated first ammendment, the judges re-wrote it. http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwa...aguillard.html The ""Act"" is the Creationism Act. Since when does the establishment clause talk about a clear secular purpose to anything? See? They re-wrote it. Read the establishment clause and then read these judges version of it. How is doing this a violation of the establishment clause? Again, read the establishment clause. Tell me where it says that any government can't endorse religion. I know I know, these judges were using these wordings based on precedent cases. Words like ""clear secular purpose"" came from previous cases. All this means is that the re-writing of the first ammendment happened before this case.","constitution-views","07:00 PM","government-debates","41"
