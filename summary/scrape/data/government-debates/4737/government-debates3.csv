However, that doesn't actually mean you convinced anyone. it merely means that it this subject isn't deemed important (or interesting) enough to further more imputs of effort.","constitution-views","10:56 PM","government-debates","32"

"04-18-2005","4737",3,"Duo_Maxwell","None","So how can you say that the consitution is not a living document when interpretation of it has changed without laws?","gnojek","108868","First, the document is only ""living"" if it is interpreted that way. It's living because judges with that philosophy have been in power for quite a while. Scalia said something about 'it's more interesting to talk about policy than to talk about the letter of the law' and 'judges who follow the living document philosophy have more power.' But anyway, there is no originalist/living document conflict with the ""cruel and unusual"" bit. The terms ""cruel and unusual"" are there to be interpreted. Adjectives can sometimes be subjective. The interpretation of these terms can change. The phrase ""Congress shall make no law"" does not have much room for interpretation. It means pretty much what it says. The original intent was to make room for states' rights. The framers didn't leave that same room in the other ammendments in the Bill of Rights. They used language like ""the people's rights wrt to this and that will not be infringed."" Why would they go through so much trouble to word the ammendments the way they did if judges can just come along and interpret them so loosely that they mean something that they don't say?","constitution-views","05:24 PM","government-debates","35"

Would you like to start with the Federalist papers and move on from there? I have yet to hear someone prove me wrong on the constitution. If you think that the cruel and unusual term doesn't apply to the living constitution then you are sadly mistaken. How do you think it became that the death penalty for minors is illegal now? The court 15yrs ago said differently!!! How can the inerpretation change with no basis other then ones own personal opinion? This is scary..people, you gotta think this stuff through!","constitution-views","10:15 PM","government-debates","36"

Years ago, it was common to treat kids worse than adults (they should be seen and not heard) and if they were bad, they were beaten not scolded. Nowadays, the legislative branch (NOT JUDGES) has passed laws saying that beating is child abuse, and the general public has a little more respect for kids. Instead of objects, they are thought of as people. Another law is that kids under 18 aren't held accountable for most actions. I'm pretty sure most minor crimes get erased from your record at 18 and they aren't considered fully responsible until they are 18. They can't enter legal contracts, other punishments are shorter (key part here) and they don't have as many rights. Since under most laws (written by the legislative branch) kids aren't held accountable (or as accountable) for their actions, punishments are shorter, and they are thought of as people, they ruled that it was cruel and unusual punishment to kill kids under 18. You can probably find the majority opinion somewhere on the internet, but I doubt you'd read it if I found it for you, so if you want it find it. The internet is a wonderful thing. You can give me quotes showing where they are writing their own laws and making it a living document and we can go from there. Something tells me you will be too lazy, but we'll see.","constitution-views","10:38 PM","government-debates","37"

The funny part about your post is that the case involving the death penatly of minors happened only 15 YEARS ago...and the judges didn't even say that case was wrong...just our standards of deceny have changed.

To know the intentions of the framers of the constitution, one only needs to review the Federalist Papers to know.

The Act is facially invalid as violative of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, because it lacks a clear secular purpose. The Establishment Clause forbids the enactment of any law ""respecting an establishment of religion"" (4). The Act violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because it seeks to employ the symbolic and financial support of government to achieve a religious purpose.","gnojek","109406","Another example is when the Supreme Court struck down state laws that force teachers to teach creationism in class. Without the living interpretation, they could not have said: Instead of reading the plainly stated first ammendment, the judges re-wrote it. http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwa...aguillard.html The ""Act"" is the Creationism Act. Since when does the establishment clause talk about a clear secular purpose to anything? See? They re-wrote it. Read the establishment clause and then read these judges version of it. How is doing this a violation of the establishment clause? Again, read the establishment clause. Tell me where it says that any government can't endorse religion. I know I know, these judges were using these wordings based on precedent cases. Words like ""clear secular purpose"" came from previous cases. All this means is that the re-writing of the first ammendment happened before this case.","constitution-views","07:00 PM","government-debates","41"
