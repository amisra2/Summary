You know those that voted for NO international law are a little bit less consistent then the ones that voted for it...I find that funny.","constitution-views","08:27 AM","government-debates","16"
"04-11-2005","4737",2,"Steeeeve","None","I don't understand what you are saying...the constitution doesn't change unless amended...and this should be the only way. Changed by amending...not by judges. Once again you miss the idea of the living document and the originalist theory...if we based what you are saying then we couldn't make any call on abortion or the death penalty because nothing in the constitution says so. However, it doesn't have to be in the constitution...remember the judges look at law. Death penalty and what not were law. They were law when the 14th amendment and below were written. The idea is that when cruel and unusual punishment amendment (8th) was created it didn't limit the death penalty because no law was struct down because of it then...so why so many years later does it mean something different? You ask where in the constitution does it mention these things...it doesn't, but they existed during periods of writting the constitution. Therefore they are not new ideas. The constitution can therefore be applied to them. A ""strict"" view of the constitution is what you are referring to by saying abortion and what not do not exist in the constitution...this is different from originalist. Finally, that link didn't prove anything but that Scalia is in fact an originialist..","Duo_Maxwell","106291","Then if the consitution is amended, it is changed to deal with modern cirucmstances. How is that applying a original view of the consitution when it is being fitted for the modern world? But you just said it was being changed. How can it be origanlist when it is being scripted for modern needs? Hence why the consitution is a living document, because such acts were ruled legal on the basis of a interpretation. Thank you for agreeing with me. I don't understand why you are aruging for a living document while arguing aganist. your argument specifically notes that the penalty was seen differently then, legislated different, and has since changed. How is that a origanlist when the intepretation of the 8th has evolved? Then you contridict yourself. A strict literalist/origingalist application is to apply the consitution specifically as it says. No if any or butts. How so? The link was to show how Scalia is attempting to make Divine Law US law, which you asked for.","constitution-views","09:04 PM","government-debates","17"
"04-11-2005","4737",2,"Steeeeve","None","Are you really asking this?...Because it was amended. Orginal view when it was written...if the amendment is written in 1992..then you look what it meant in 1992 because this is what the people that created it thought it should do. Do you really not know what originalism and living constitution(ism) are? lol, just because they aer ruled a certain way doesn't make it the right way it shoulda been done....if a judge said no free speech what so ever, would this be legal too? You seem confused... I am arguing against a living document. no where was I arguing for it... I said the 8th amendment means what it meant when it was written..unless a law changes that...it will remain today. And it proved nothing other than Scalia is an orginalist...not to mention the insane outta context quotes. For the final time (and please listen)...and Orginalist is different form the strict constitution theory. Orginalist believe that a law means what it meant when it was written...I always give this example: When the 8th amendment was written cruel and unusual included children under 18, hangings, etc.","Duo_Maxwell","106314","Then under such logic, any time a ammendement is added, the consitution gains new grounds. A nonliving document cannot grow or change. A living one can. I don't understand why you are arguing for and aganist at the same time. It would appear you do not. Well, that would specifically go aganist the bill or rights. It's a bad analogy. What I am talking about is specifically how the consitution was interpreted to mean different things at different times. Slavery was allowed under the consitution. Yet now it is not. Interesting isn't it how the consitution, seemingly a dead document has changed to fit the needs of the specific time. Seems pretty living to me. On the contrary, you clearly argue that the consitution can be ammended, that it can be changed. You also talked about how the views of the 8th ammendement changed over time. How can a dead document be applied in various different interpretations if is not living? so why so many years later does it mean something different? Well, you clearly show that it DOES mean something different. IF the document was non-living, then it could not mean something different. Therefore, you are clearly supporting claims that it has changed in its meaning without a ammendement. It wasn't trying to. It was a response to your request for evidence about Scalia and Divine law. Please read before posting. Alright. wait a minute. Are you arguing that we should apply a Orginalist view or that the consitution is a non-living document? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Originalism","constitution-views","10:11 PM","government-debates","19"

"04-13-2005","4737",2,"None","None","None","gnojek","106927","If one interprets the constitution as an originalist (as I voted) then there is absolutely no provision in the consitution that would prohibit a state from establishing a religion, restricting speech or the press. The first ammendment makes no mention of state law, only what congress can do. I could be totally wrong, but I have challenged a few people (none lawyers) to prove to me that there is such a thing as ""freedom of religion"" or ""free speech"" in the United States according to the consitution. There are no such guarantees. The original wording's purpose was to keep from interfering with states' rights. If a state wanted to restrict speech, then let them, as long as congress wasn't involved (according to the wording). But, using a ""living consitution"" interpretation, the supreme court has ruled numerous times that, say, teaching creationism in public schools is unconstitutional. They say things like ""The Establishment Clause forbids the enactment of any law ""respecting an establishment of religion"" ."" http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/edwa...lard.html#Held But it doesn't say that. Only if judges re-write the 1st ammendment does it say that. I missed Antonin Scalia. He spoke near here on Monday. I've heard he doesn't like to announce where he'll be speaking. Too bad I missed it. I think he said he was an originalist. He must be against free speech.","constitution-views","07:26 PM","government-debates","22"
"04-13-2005","4737",2,"None","None","None","Duo_Maxwell","106949","*sigh* Using a originalist view, every time application of a law changed, that would mean the consitution would have to have a law added or amended. Has this happened? No. Example, cruel and unusual has changed over the years. The 8th ammendemnet did not include specific means of punishment that we used to use. If there was a origanlist in place, to include such a change would require a law. Was there a law? No, there was not. The Supreme court ruled that _____ was cruel and unusual and therefore outlawed it on the basis of the consitutuion. The interpretation of what constitutied what was cruel and ususual changed without ammending the consitution. So how can you say that the consitution is not a living document when interpretation of it has changed without laws?","constitution-views","08:10 PM","government-debates","23"

Either way, you still haven't provided reason for the living constitution....In fact, no one has. Don't look at the constitutin either...it won't help because it says the judges have the ""judicial power""...thats all. I will now wait for your response about what judicial power is...and after you mess that up I will proceed to correct you because judicial power doesn't mean the power to say laws evolve other time...So lets just cut that out right now. Just tell me what is the basis for a living constitution? In fact let me just list out my questions: 1) What basis is there for the living constitution? 2) How is ruling on something that uses public opinion not legislating? 3) How does a legal document have its words change without actually changing the words. 4) What criterion do the judges follow with the living constitution? Those are few that have never (and will never) be answered. Because the living constitution is just a way for a judge to have the consitution mean what he wants it to mean.","constitution-views","10:36 PM","government-debates","26"
"04-13-2005","4737",2,"None","None","None","Duo_Maxwell","107036","Lookie what I found.... http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/law/lws...2_1/02_FMS.htm Judical power is the right to set precedence. That means each judge has the ability to set how the law is applied. Whether or not this means it changes is irrevelant. It merely has the capacity to do so. You should get in the habit of not assuming. 1) The constution is specifically vague, not to mention that the founders were not originalists either. 2) Legislation requires legislators. Judges rule outside of such. Therefore any ruling outside of the legislature is not legislation, as only they have the ability to legislate laws. It disturbs me you asked that. 3) Easily. Words change over time, while the exactly spelling does not (unless you move from the states to Britain or vice versa), their meanings do as well as interpretations of how those words work together. A document in the early 40s that describes ""gay culture"" or a happy life, would obviously mean something vastly different today, yet the words themselves haven't changed in respect to their order or spelling, their meanings have. 4) Precedent.

Oh wait, they just did get answered. You should get in the habit of not assuming. A long-standing tradition has viewed precedent as a necessary starting point for judicial decision. When a court departs from this core idea, it violates the essential function of the judiciary to treat like cases alike or explain the difference","Steeeeve","107056","Hehe, 1) You answered my first question by saying the living constitution is based on the constitution. Which makes no sense. 2) By ruling on something that is law (say the death penalty for under 18) and the judges say that world views and standards of decency make the death penalty for someone under 18 unconstitutional thus making it against the law...how is this not a legislating power? I thought the legislating body makes things laws...or rather if something is illegal or legal. 3) ok, in the event that meanings of words DO change...who decides this and by what criterion. (this is not true by the way....because gay still means happy and legal documents can't have meanings or words changed in them). 4) you are joking right...if precedent is your criterion then the under 18 death penalty case woulda gone the other way. They ruled that the past case was valid...yet the chaning standards of decency changed thus making it bad...SO I ask again, what is your criterion. So wait...none have been answered...you just gave answers that make no sense. As for the link...i can tell you didn't read it very well (but then again neither did I so I won't hold it against you) however I did see this at the very beginning... When the judiciary departs from the idea of precedent (in other words their judicial power) they violate the function of the judiciary branch...this is what the living constitution does!!!!","constitution-views","12:38 AM","government-debates","28"

I merely said that the consitution was vague and that the founders were not origanlists. I suggest you read it carefully next time. Judges can strike down laws. They cannot make them. Even in the gay marriage argument, Judges can only strike down bans, they cannot force new laws into existance. The only people who can legislate are those who are in the legislature. I'm still disturbed you asked this. It's basic knowledge of how the government works. Society does, or some major event. It is true in many aspects of life. gay as happy is a archeic term, the english language is full of them, it's just evidence that words change meaning. Legal documents can have their meanings changed. What was previously ruled cruel and unusual changes meaning, as we have seen with the death penalty in the 70s. Precedent can be changed. One can set a new precedent which then may or may not be followed. My answer is unchanged. Self proclamation of incoherenace does not make it so. Also, your inability to read properly doesn;t help your case either. You ignored two key words: starting point As I have said before, a precedent may or may not be followed. it merely is the starting point. I suggest you calm down, also Cone could teach you alot.","constitution-views","01:05 AM","government-debates","29"
