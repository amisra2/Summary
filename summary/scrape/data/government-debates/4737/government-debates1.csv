"04-05-2005","4737",1,"None","None","None","pandion","104307","How does a document that begins with ""We the People of the United States..."" apply to international law? I think that your question is badly stated. I may adopt either position towards the Constitution without any opinion on international law - mostly because the Constitution doesn't affect international law. In spite of what our President may believe, our Constitution is the Constitution of the United States - not of France, Great Britain, Afghanistan, or Iraq. But if the question is whether the Constitution is a living document? Then yes. If not, why the provisions to amend it? Times change and the amendment process allows the Constitution to change with them. Moreover, it is the job of the courts, the ultimate opinion coming from the Supreme Court, to interpret the meaning of the Constitution as it applies to every age. In fact, the sole function of the Supreme Court is to decide constitutional questions, not matters of law. So yes, the Constitution is a living document since the functions of the legislature to amend the document (with approval of the states) and the function of the Supreme court to decide what it means are included in the original document. But there is nothing about international law.","constitution-views","01:30 AM","government-debates","2"

With new technologies and stuff it is a different story. View the cspan thing about Judge Scalia...he explains it better than me...There is not vague knowledge of the constutition and how was created either. In fact we have mass documents on it. The bill of rights too. Not to mention one can amend the constutition if they want it more clear.","constitution-views","05:41 PM","government-debates","8"
"04-05-2005","4737",1,"None","None","None","Master_Shake","104557","I also agree that the poll could have been worded better. For example, if I am getting your meaning, I think Strict Constructionist would be a better term than Originalist. In any case, as a rule, I do not agree with the strict constructionist view. It causes problems. For example, strict constructionists tend to believe that we are only guaranteed rights that are explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. This was why quite a few delegates to the constitution did not want a bill of rights in the first place because they felt that someone in the future would attempt to limit people to only those rights.","constitution-views","06:08 PM","government-debates","9"

It doesn't say that we can't ban abortion, the penalty or any such measure. Besides, you've clearly contridicted your argument. To rule based upon the consitution is to interpret it to deal with today's situtations , that is not a strict literal view. To have such a strict application one needs the very esscence, feelings and intensions of the writers. You cannot litterally apply something that is intensionally vague. Yet we lack other things they might have felt, thought, wanted and so on and so forth. Scalia's #1 intension is to make Divine Law US law. Scalia himself is interepreting the consitution how he feels when he makes a ruling. He's not applying a strict view himself.","constitution-views","04:25 PM","government-debates","11"
"04-06-2005","4737",1,"Steeeeve","None","How so you ask? Because laws about abortion, death penalty, and many of the other ""issues"" were on the books at the time of the constitution and or amendments. The idea is that when an amendment is written, say the cruel and unusual one, we apply what it meant then. Then it mean't a lot of things, hanging and what not. So in the future why would it all of a sudden mean something different? It doesn't. In fact to change what is cruel and unusual you would have to tell congress to get rid of the death penalty. So you are applying it to today situations, but these situations are by no means new. The ones that are..thats a different story. Abortion, death penalty, homosexual sodemy are not new at all. I would like to see some evidence of this.","Duo_Maxwell","104883","So they are therefore changing the consitution to suit what they need? How is that a literalist practice when the consitution is changing from time to time? It's not. Yet we can change this. Doesn't that imply the consitution is therefore a living document, able to change as the needs arise, and therefore NOT a originalist? Where per se, does the constution or ammendemnets talk specifically about the death penalty, abortion or other such issues? IF we were to apply it literally, we could not apply such measures or act upon them since they were not mentioned in the document. Therefore, any application of such is using the consitution as a living document. Cite them for me in the consitution then. http://www.law.indiana.edu/ilj/v72/no4/colinvau.html","constitution-views","04:49 PM","government-debates","13"
