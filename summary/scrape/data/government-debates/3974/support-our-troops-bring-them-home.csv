The shooting of an unarmed, wounded Iraqi in a mosque accidentally recorded by an embedded reporter is extremely damaging to every American and indeed every American military man and woman. Remember that the Iraqis did not kill, rape, or torture our most famous prisoner of the Iraq War, Jessica Lynch. Injured from the wreck of her vehicle, she was well-treated by the Iraqis in a hospital by doctors and nurses! Why all the lies about liberating Iraq? The Iraqis see us not as liberators, but as foreign conquerors and occuppiers , as of course we are, all spin put aside. Recently, there has been repeated talk about how many of those among the ""insurgents"" are foreigners. Think of that, how dare these ""foreigners"" be in Iraq to oppose the occupation of their country? In reality, our best estimates are that less the 5 percent of the insurgents are from outside of Iraq, and most of them are from neighboring countries who came to aid Iraq just as many Americans would go to the aid of Canada if it were invaded.

Any nation that would actually attack or try to attack America, I would be all for nuking the whole damn place, so I dont want anyone to get the idea that I am un-American by what I am about to say. But the fact is a lot of us are dying and what is even worse maybe being blinded and burned and crippled, and for what? It is sure not to protect America. I am on my second tour of duty and I worked with some units in the billion-dollar Easter egg hunt for WMD. We didnt find anything of the sort , and every time we found a bottle of bug spray the guys the white suits would come over and examine it for chemical or biological agents. And every time it turned out to be the same insecticides that are routinely used on our own crops back in Louisiana!

Too late now, we'll just continue to pay off N. Korea as we have in the past, rattle the saber at Iran and continue accumulating massive public debt under the guise of humanitarianism in Iraq. Are there people who actually still believe in that axis of evil claim? Even after we've leveled Iraq and continue to kill them off while being killed? I guess having the highest prison population in the developed world entitles us to cast stones at others.","support-our-troops-bring-them-home","09:49 AM","government-debates","7"

If you talk to people that have been over there, the worst fear of the Iraqi people is that we will leave. Another thing, what happens when we bring them home. That will leave a void in the middle east which will tear the area apart. Then the terrorists will have free time to plan attacks on the citizens of the US. At this point, we have put a crimp in their style(forgive my spelling) and we need to continue to hurt them. About the unarmed Iraqi, the guy had his friend killed the day before by a unarmed Iraqi that detonated a bomb.","support-our-troops-bring-them-home","01:16 PM","government-debates","8"

The attackers won't be in the ME, they'll be in the US. With their cell structure communications limited to one ajacent cell, conventional military forces, including all the seemingly unlimited variation of special ops in each service branch, would be useless in fighting them regardless of where they'd be based. Unless, of course, you're advocating invading and occupying Saudia Arabia, Pakistan, Egypt, the Sudan and several dozen other smaller countries known to harbor terrorists. Then why would we need Iraq? Incidently, Iraq doesn't supply us with a base, we invaded and occupied Iraq under false pretense.","support-our-troops-bring-them-home","06:35 PM","government-debates","12"
