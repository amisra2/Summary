That is why China gave up on pursuing war compensation. So the two countries can rebuild relationship again. If not, China wouldn't sign the friendship agreement with Japan on 1982. For so many years, you could hear ""sino-Japan friendship on TV almost everyday in China. Dont say Chinese dont know what Japanese have done after the war, most of them just wanna peace and friendship.","didn-t-chinese-people-accept-japan-s-apologies","11:38 PM","government-debates","1"

Fair enough, this is what every intellectual should advocate -- informed opinion always rules over blind hatred. Last Spring Festival, my brother came to Beijing, one evening, he told he met a Japanese guy on the way to the Summer Palace, he didnt know how to get there, my brother led him to the place, but he told me the boy was a little bit nervous, maybe he was afraid of the Chinese would hurt him. Actually, China is a friendly country and most of the Chinese people wont hurt anyone, even Japanese. Although Chinese people had plenty to criticize about, they still want peace and stability. Why always we hurt each other?","didn-t-chinese-people-accept-japan-s-apologies","11:39 PM","government-debates","2"

Although they did apologise to the Chinese on 17 different occasions, the Japanese don't really want to acknowledge that the Imperial army slaughtered hundreds of thousands of civilians. They just keep saying ""We did some bad stuff."" And the Chinese on their part don't want to acknowledge all the millions of Chinese that died during Mao's reign. Both sides suffer from a convenient form of amnesia.","didn-t-chinese-people-accept-japan-s-apologies","01:58 AM","government-debates","4"

Apparently Japan even gased a large number of Chinese. Have you heard the japanese apoligies? They are pathetic. For a country that suffered the rape of nanking, I wouldn't be suprised they are still ****** when it comes to such japanese claims.","didn-t-chinese-people-accept-japan-s-apologies","03:16 AM","government-debates","5"

Japan invests a lot of money in China and is one of its biggest trading partners. Japan on the other hand needs China so it can get its hands on all those cheap consumer products. I read an iteresting article the other day on the BBC website which basically stated that the Chinese government condones the anti-Japanese protests because it deflects attention away from its own domestic troubles (like the civil unrest which is caused by the ever increasing gap between the rich city folks and the poor farmers). And as for textbooks, do you think Chinese textbooks even mention the millions of people that died under Mao, or the thousands of students that died on Tienamen square in 1989. It's a classic case of the pot calling the kettle black. Both sides are too proud and suffer from revisionist history syndrome.","didn-t-chinese-people-accept-japan-s-apologies","07:24 AM","government-debates","8"
