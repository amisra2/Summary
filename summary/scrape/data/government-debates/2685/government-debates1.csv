The answer is that most everyone holds to the notion that The Fed is another Government Agency like the IRS, when in actuality it is a private bank. European International Bankers failed in their first attempt to establish a central bank in the USA in 1910, when they tried to pass a bill with the name Paul Warburg attached. That bill would finally pass in December of 1913 cleverly disguised as the Federal Reserve Act. Does anyone else remember Bill Clintons solution to our monetary problems, just after he first took office? His idea was to get rid of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has shareholders, like any other private bank, who benefit from the money siphoned out of our economy. They turned our gold based silver certificate US Treasury Notes into confidence based Federal Reserve Notes. These European money managers have been systematically robbing us of wealth for most the past 100 years. These are the same people who financed both sides of WW1 and WW2. Their ultimate goal is a one world government and one world currency. The best source I know of for more information is a book by Gary Allen called None Dare Call It Conspiracy that was written in the early 70s. Just where do you believe all of this money goes when The Fed raises rates? Answer: To their shareholders. This is perhaps the most cunning and devious conspiracy/plan ever devised to divert wealth from the hands of so many into the hands of so very few. When the economy begins earning more, they simply raise the rates and take more. By raising the cost of money, they cause everything in our economy to cost more. And that is their excuse to raise rates even higher. I believe we need to elect leaders willing to repeal the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and give the right to print money back to the US Treasury. Let the government tack on their interest rate, and use the money to pay off the national debt. Keep our wealth in the USA economy, and stop allowing it to go overseas in the form of shareholder profits. Bring Federal indictments against the owners/shareholders of this private bank, who have been profiting by placing a tax on our own money, and take back what is ours.

Especially when food and energy costs are excluded from your base inflation calculations when presented to the general public. You do raise interest rates if foreign investors who purchase 45% of your desperately needed treasury issues start clamoring for you to make up the difference in what your dollar is costing them. Especially if that dollar is in front of a charging 600 pound gorilla called massive trade imbalance and you start slapping import tariffs on anything in sight to help polish your GDP, even though it will also put a crimp in your strongest industry, domestic construction. Fractional reserve banking? The Fed loaded up every bank in the country with tons of cash on 9/12. No problem or panic, we're a dysfunctional credit based economy. Our politicians praised us for our strong hearts in a critical time. I consider the board a quasi-government entity controlled by standing politicians who tell them their only concern is making public statements that sooth the citizenry. The current chairman barked once at a bankers convention about excessive levels of deficit spending being bad and that was it. He's now at heel and the crusade is continuing to move forward to???","federal-reserve-not-part-us-government","08:52 PM","government-debates","4"

This seems to be kind of a grey area in the constitution. Can one delegate away their responsibilities as outlined by law? The SCOTUS says yes. I don;t have the legal background on such issues to wade into such an argument. I don't buy the conspiracy theories surrounding the fed. I do think it was a terrible mistake to remove the backing from our currency, and I we will pay deeply for it (we already are).","federal-reserve-not-part-us-government","01:56 AM","government-debates","7"

I'm thinking that the reason why some powers were given to the federal government was because those services shouldn't be handled in a private sector. The federal government also provides for and supports our armed forces, can declare war. IMO it's fairly easy to see that these jobs shouldn't be put into the hands of a private corporation... so why would it be ok to delegate away the responsibility of coining money. i'm fairly suspicious of conspiracy theories too... but there can still be some truth found in conspiracy theorist's arguments. That's why i focus more on the constitutional issue, and the effects the removal of the federal reserve would have on the economy now, as opposed to arguing that the fed reserve act was passed in 1913 because of support from european bankers, and that the same bankers were responsible for WW I and II.","federal-reserve-not-part-us-government","11:26 AM","government-debates","8"

It's been my experiences that sites like that tend to be a bit biased and under researched. Terrals reply >> The links provided in the original post lead to more than one book on the topic. The word conspiracy is attached, because that is the nature of the beast. Kronus >> For some more accurate info, try: http://www.federalreserve.gov/ Terrals reply >> Since this is a conspiracy, then two or more parties are involved in the scheme. The implication is that your .gov sites are part of the problem. The conspiracy involves many parties working together for the purposes of smoke-screening news publications (involving Trilateral Commission, Council on Foreign Relations under the auspices of the group called the Bilderbergers), image preservation (making FED appear as a Department of the Government), opinion molding of the public, etc.. This is just one horn of the beast, and a very small portion of the overall plan to bring in the New World Order. http://www.angelfire.com/tx4/nwo/nwo_conspiracies.html Kronus says >> In summary, the Fed is a bank created by act of congress. It's board of governers is appointed by the President and approved by Congress. Terrals reply >> In summary of what? You have not said anything? The Federal Reserve is most definitely not part of our Government. It is a private central bank. Therefore, your federalreserve.gov address also serves to forward their delusion. In light of the overall Bilderberger Plan, and the fact that they play a large role in the selection of our Presidential candidates and the molding of public opinion, our President choosing the Chairman (a word you left out of your post) means very little. Imagine that you are part of the three hundred man group from the riches and most powerful families in the world. What is it that you want? The answer is . . . more money and more power. The people appointed to the Fed board are front men for those powerful elite shareholder members. Since you are one of the most powerful people in the world, then you can afford to place anyone you wish into power and remain behind the scenes. Kronus >> The board then acts independently of the executive and legislative branches, in that it doesn't have to have its decisions ratified. Terrals reply >> And you do not believe this to be in the least bit convenient for a group of private bankers, that is not part of our government; that we have absolutely no right to vote for any of its members? Experience tells me that there are three kinds of people: Those who make things happen, those who allow things to happen, and those who say What happened? So this Private Central Bank does not have to have its decisions ratified. They are performing tasks that belong to our US Treasury, which is a department of the US Government. You seem to believe that our current Federal Reserve Notes are superior to the Silver Certificate Notes that were backed by gold from the US Treasury in years past. You also seem in love with the fact that the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 was initiated by Paul Warburg and a group of European International Bankers. No sir. There is a stench coming from the takeover of our monetary system by the owners of this Central Bank, and your All is well message does not seem out of ignorance. Kronus >> However, it is suseptible to Congressional oversight, and can have its responsibilities changed by act of congress. Terrals reply >> Okay Mr. Under Researched . . . Please provide us with a sequential list of each occurrence of Congress changing the responsibilities of this Private Central Bank. GL. Kronus >> The Fed does not have share holders. Any money it makes from fees, etc goes towards covering its expences, with any excess going to the US treasury. Terrals reply >> Any money? You act as if the Fed might not make money this year. We are talking about billions and billions of dollars that are currently exiting our economy every year. And, you pretend that the Fed is making regular deposits to our US Treasury. Please provide us with just how much they have contributed every year since 1913. GL with that also. Our money was backed by gold, but not anymore. Where did all the gold go? And, where did all the gold in the Fed banks come from? Why is that gold not controlled by the US Treasury? Any surplus my eye . . . The discount rate they charge amounts to a tax on our own money. Again, the US Treasury should be charging us this fee, then that money used to reduce the national debt. That takes the government out of the market of borrowing money, FROM THESE SAME INTERNATIONAL BANKERS!, and that creates a positive environment for our prosperity.
