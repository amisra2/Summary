Face it wen there lips move they are either (1) kissing youre a$$ (2) lying, or (3) both,","talk-about-flip-flops-bushs-broken-campaign-promises","05:47 PM","government-debates","3"

That's all I can think of. There are exceptions, but they seldom break out of local levels. Anyone who trusts any politician to put their constituents first is either very immature, naive or should probably be institutionalized. Their God is the Party, nothing else. I fear it may take a severe economic depression to clean their ranks out, but our mostly follower citizenry will probably put their henchmen right into office.","talk-about-flip-flops-bushs-broken-campaign-promises","07:59 PM","government-debates","4"

While I certainly would rather have Bush as president over John Kerry, I am very disappointed in some of the things Bush has done to stab his conservative base in the back. That site linked above is funny though... because almost all of the articles listed are from the NY Times. Lol... who says it's not at all a liberal-leaning paper???
