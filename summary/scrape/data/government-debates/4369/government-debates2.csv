One of the many conditions China presents to foreign companies desiring to export to China or joint-venture within China is length of commitment. Anything under a 10-year commitment, incidentally the favored and adhered to Chinese economic planning span, faces a formidable tax structure that quickly eliminates fast-buck artists and under-capitalized entities. Once that commitment is accepted and agreed upon, layers of taxes magically disappear and incentives appear. China is looking at the long haul, holding all the cards, and ties everything together in a rational manner that facilitates superior planning and execution. Let's not forget China made it a point to educate their best minds in the cream of European, Russian and US universities when foreign exchange was very scarce and dear to China. One of the major reasons US corporations were the last on the boat with trade and manufacturing within China, with many still waiting at the dock, was our traditional short-term political and business planning. The USD has been in decline for 30-years, with the past three approaching near panic stages due to current administration fiscal policies. IMO the emergence of the Euro, with multi-faceted national economy strength as an alternative currency reserve to the fading USD, provided an opportunity for ailing major US corporations to make those long-term commitments required for doing business with China and begin the process of moving assets away from the USD. I'd think Canadian businesses, the large, smart ones, are also using the USD's demise to relocate performing assets and capital investments away from eventual pure USD trade. While oil and other natural resources are so immensely profitable that absorbing a 30% loss on exchange rates can still be managed with hedges, food producers and other consumer industries have to be seeing the writing on the wall. Becoming uncompetitive due to currency differences sounds like whining because those managers are tied to USD trade. The lazy ones will fail, while visionaries understand changing markets is the solution. US industry is now so far behind the curve in manufacturing ability with no capital spending on technology and equipment improvements for years that US competition isn't and won't be a factor. Unless one is restricted to trading in US dollars.","us-dollar","10:02 AM","government-debates","16"
