"02-23-2004","1755",3,"Broker","None","Oh wow... you pay really well then. I figured more like 50 employees... But that change in corporate culture isn't going to happen. Corporations want profit, not to serve a social cause. AMD: That happens in every industry on some scale. Some people won't be able to compete. That's our system. Wal-Mart employs a great deal of people too, and it's very easy to climb their ladder because of that.","daewoo","35715","Yes, I do pay them pretty well. I take no small amount of pride in how I treat my employees. Walmart is expected to post over 18 billion in profits this year. They start their people at $5.25/ hr, and they get a 25 cent annual raise. This just isn't right. There are folks at Wal mart that have been there for 15 yrs and are barely making over minimum wage! Treating you people well is only serving ""some social cause"" to the same extent that choosing not to murder is serving ""some social cause"". Some things you do because they are legal, sometimes you do things because they are easy, and sometimes you do things because they are RIGHT.","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","12:24 PM","government-debates","31"

THe policy was originally instituted when Sam Walton was still alive. My grandfater was a friend of his, and I remember grandpa talking about what a great guy Sam was for ensuring that every employee got a raise. OF course, when the policy was originally created, a quarter raise actually was enough to MEAN something. The, Waltons ""lazy, good for nothing"" (wlatons words, not mine) kids took over, and have maintained the SAME policy.","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","12:29 AM","government-debates","33"

It seems every time we give a tax break to rich people they invest the money overseas, currency markets or bonds. It also appears that when the minimum wage is raised millions of people go out and buy stuff with their new money. Wouldn't it be logical to use a trickle up approach.","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","11:15 PM","government-debates","34"

Neither economic theory really takes into account greed as a motivational force.

"02-26-2004","1755",3,"None","None","None","ElRojoGrande","36495","I have no opposition to free trade and open economic competition. If we are going too compete with other countries for production jobs they should be held to the same standards. They should be held to pay standards, safety standards, employee benefit standards. I do not feel, as I have heard some say that this would impose our way of life on other cultures. I do feel that in order to open our doors to foreign products we should know up front that they atleast are not stealing from our economy. If 1500 hundred jobs leave the US to a plant in China at a fifth of the labor cost how is that not stealing from our economy. 1500 jobs, 1500 consumers, at 12.00 dollars an hour that is 37,440,000 stolen from our economy with no recourse.","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","05:15 PM","government-debates","37"

Do you have a suggestion for what might work.","daewoo","36562","I have heard that quote before. Who said that? The problem is, once citizens begin voting things like welfare, etc.. the democracy becomes much closer to a socialist system. When the folks at the top of a capitolistic system take form the system without returning, you end up with a feudal system. The theory of capitolism is based on the cyclic distrobution of wealth. Money flows uphill, and trickles back down. This is not happening.","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","09:48 PM","government-debates","38"
"02-27-2004","1755",3,"None","None","None","Broker","36722","Well obviously I would say that that hasn't been true... look at the stock market now, look at it in the 1980s... people weren't and aren't really looking for other investments because other markets have not yet even stabazlied following the global recession... Germany almost dipped back into negative growth last quarter. And that money isn't taken from our economy either... it's profit into a coporation's bank account or distributed to shareholders. If we don't take advantage of India and China, well, everyone else will, and we'll be left behind. Chinese workers don't make a lot from our point of view... but that's good money for them, and they've got a job they otherwise wouldn't have. That's why the Chinese government has been so welcoming of international corporations. And the software engineer in India who makes $10,000 a year is pretty happy too. I don't think these countries can jump from their level of economic activity to a post-industrial economic stucture. It's just not going to happen... it's a gradual process of improvement. Certainly it will be faster for them, but it's absurd to say they won't have to go through what every other industrialized nation went through.","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","11:20 PM","government-debates","39"

The fact that the overseas markets have not yet stabilised is what makes it enticing to those who can afford to loose a little money in search of a huge return (we are talking people with 100's of millions of dollar). THe American market is primarily overvalued. In order to calculate a companies ""real"" stock value, you basically add all their assets, subtract all their debts, and divide by the number of outstanding shares. Very few american companies come out well on this comparison. In the more volatile overseas markets, it is till possible to pick up bargain stocks. I bought some stock the other day ont he japanese exchange that is undervalued by almost 400%. Even if the stock market was to crash, this has very little bearing on the real world value of the stock. Even if the company closed up shop tommorow and liquidated, I would be 400% ahead. As far as money disapearing and corporate bank accounts, this is a viable point. LArge account holders do not keep their money in US banks. By shopping aruond, it is not difficult to find banks on the international scene that offer 12% interest on accounts. When GM moves 4 billion dollars offshore, it is GONE as far as the US economy is concerned. What they do is take their total overseas interest and issue half of it as a dividend to their investors. It is important to note when listing assets, many (in fact, most large) companies include ""domestic funds"". Getting information in international funds is like pulling teeth. This is because they generally pay dividends from part of the interest recieved on international accounts. they are making 12% on 15 billion in international accounts, they earmark half of that for dividends (6%) and they are still socking away 6% interest. Of course, those billions of dollars are no longer spurring the american economy. They have been removed. For all the good it is doing us, they may as well burn it. This is because money in the bank is not just sitting, it is working. The bank takes your money and loans it to other people (which is how you get interest). All those billions of dollars are not available to lend.","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","12:34 AM","government-debates","40"
