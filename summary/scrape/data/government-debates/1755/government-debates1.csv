"02-14-2004","1755",1,"None","None","None","DrD","34769","This week, we learned that President Bush supports sending American jobs overseas. The White House released a report that said ""When a good or service is produced more cheaply abroad, it makes more sense to import it than to make it or provide it domestically."" And one of President Bush's top economic advisers called outsourcing -- when companies fire Americans and send their jobs overseas -- ""a good thing."" With that attitude, it's easy to see how Bush can be proud of his record of losing 2.9 million jobs since he took office -- the first president to lose jobs during his term since Herbert Hoover. If sending American jobs overseas is ""a good thing,"" then Bush should be proud of his record of hemorrhaging jobs. Of course, the millions of Americans who are out of work would disagree. http://www.democrats.org/action/tell...402140001.html","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","09:46 AM","government-debates","1"

And outsourcing is great... there are plenty of jobs out there... most people just don't want them. And the number isn't 2.9 million. It's more like 2.3 million now.","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","10:26 AM","government-debates","2"
"02-14-2004","1755",1,"None","None","None","daewoo","34786","People don't want them because they don't pay anything. This is one aspect of our economy that bush seems to be overlooking. Everything in a capitolist system is supposed to be based on supply and demand, even jobs. If you can't find somebody to do the job you need done for $5.25/hr, logic suggests that you need to pay more. Instead, under Bush, there seems to be a push to either bring in a bunch of mexicans to do the job, or export the job. This is one aspect of bushes administration that I have been very dissapointed in. Plans like this short circuit capitolism.","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","02:13 PM","government-debates","3"

Although outsourcing will be great in 2010 it is not so great here in 2004. It is a case of mistiming an action.","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","12:12 AM","government-debates","5"

There were jobs out there that people weren't willing to do for the money offered. Solution....Amnesty for illegals. It is not a question of raising the minimum wage. Minimum wage is only needed in times where there is massive unemployment. There is a 100% accurate way to calculate what a given job should pay. You find out what a qualified employee is willing ot do the job for. This is the cornerstone of capitolism, supply and demand. I can remember the president giving a speach in 1989 where it was claimed that by 2005, there would be over 5 million excess jobs. I don't see it happening. There is a vast, complex formula they use to calculate job growth. The only thing that you can say for sure about it is that every long range projection EVER has been wrong. I was discussing this the other day at a brunch that was attended by a couple of senators. One of them said ""I have seen credible reports that show the economy going both ways. Your guess is as good as mine. Either things will turn around and be very good, or they won't and it will be VERY bad"". sending jobs overseas, especially when there is so much uncertainty about what is going to happen in regards to the domestic economy, is crazy. I reeally thought when Bush was elected that he was the kind of president we needed. He ran on a platform of honesty and integrity. Instead we have gotten a guy who misguides the American public in order to provide cheap labor for his corporate cronies. He has not ticked me off enough to start campaigning for Kerry (I am not a socialist), but I have sent a couple of checks to various canidates, and fully plan to throw away my vote on election day to a third party.","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","02:59 AM","government-debates","6"

By 2010 we will have had millions upon millions of people who have left the work force... which is why we'll have so many extra jobs... so that is a realistic projection...","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","12:49 PM","government-debates","7"

A working retirement seems to be the norm anymore. You also need to consider that these estimates are based on a consumption pattern that is identical to current patterns. When people retire, their consumption goes WAY down (AARP). What we loose when the baby boomers retire (supposing they do) is not justy 10 million employees, but 10 million ful consumers. Retirees (again, quoting the AARP) spend less than 20% as much as non-retirees on non-essentials. For all intents and purposes, we will be loosing 10 million consumers. The loss of such a large consumer base does not lend itself well to estimates of surplus jobs.","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","12:59 PM","government-debates","8"
"02-15-2004","1755",1,"None","None","None","Broker","34848","Alright then, let's say that only 20% of those jobs are still needed. That's still 2 million more jobs than people to fill them.","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","03:56 PM","government-debates","9"

What is the rate that we are filling those jobs right now? Based on the fact that we are about to virtually legalize millions of illegals, I'd say those jobs are already spoken for with more to come. That worries me.","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","11:39 PM","government-debates","10"
"02-15-2004","1755",1,"None","None","None","daewoo","34874","EXACTLY. 2 million jobs can be created and destroyed in 30 days (look at the Carter administration).

"02-16-2004","1755",1,"Broker","None","Since those people haven't retired yet, we aren't filling those jobs.","AMD4EVER","34931","So basically before those jobs are even opened up we have already filled them by legalizing millions and you don't see a problem with this logic?","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","06:26 PM","government-debates","13"
"02-16-2004","1755",1,"None","None","None","Broker","34947","Those millions of people here are already working... and they aren't doing skilled jobs (at least the vast majority). Those 10 million people who will retire by 2010 are, for the most part, doing skilled work. Like I said, there are lots of jobs out there. Americans just don't want them.","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","09:10 PM","government-debates","14"

I guess they expect more to come because of the promise of being able to get a job here not only from Mexico but also from Asia. Are you sure those jobs will remain in 2010 at this pace?","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","10:54 PM","government-debates","15"
