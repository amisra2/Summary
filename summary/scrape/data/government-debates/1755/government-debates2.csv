The fact is that the ILLEGALS will be getting jobs legally, get better educated, and will soon be taking higher level jobs. Also consider that the amount of illegals crossing will continue to grow as others succeed here causing more joblessness. The bottom line is that sending jobs overseas works fine as long as it can be controlled. What Bush is doing with the illegals make this an uncontrollable situation that is destine to result in Americans losing more jobs in the future while paying taxes to support those who shouldn't legally even be here. It is complete nonsense and someone should stand up against it.","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","06:28 PM","government-debates","17"
"02-18-2004","1755",2,"Broker","None","What percent of those people can do skilled work?","daewoo","35078","You would be VERY surprised. I think I operate the only production facility around here that does not hire illegals. In town, we have IBP (Iowa beef) Modine, Caterpillar, Menu Foods, Bunge, and a half dozen machine shops. Every one of them hires illegals on a pretty big scale. The illegals we get through here usually know how to work with their hands, they know the basics of mechanics (a lot of mexicans still work on their own cars!!) and know how to use basic tools. I have a college kid that is an ""intern"" (read that...low paid slave who is willing to work for half of what the other guys get just to have some experience for his resume). First day, taught him how to use a cordless drill. Second day,m taught him how to hold and swing a hammer properly (the handle is 14"" long, you don't have to hold the 4"" that is closest to the head). My wife had a dead battery at work the other day. She couldn't only find a single person (there are about 200 people where she works) who had a set of jumper cables, and he didn't have any idea at all how to use them. Her boss was concerned the other day that, since his van made a funny noise when he turned on the heater, the radiator fan was going to fly off, punch through the engine, and enter the cab of the van. I always stop for people who are broke down on the highway. You would be absolutly amazed how few Americans know where their jack is. Even fewer know how to use it. One guy I stopped to help with a flat tire said ""I got it jacked up, but can't get the bolts off, because the wheel just keeps spinning when I try to break them loose"". I have yet to see a mexican do a lot of the totally STUPID XXXX I see Americans do on a daily basis, and we have a really big mexican/illegal population around here. Most of the other business owners around here think I am NUTS for not hiring the illegals. They grow up working with their hands, and they know how to do it.","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","12:18 AM","government-debates","18"

"02-20-2004","1755",2,"None","None","None","daewoo","35393","Illegals do NOT only fill jobs that nobody else will. IBP is almost entirely staffed by illegals. 10 years ago, it was NOT entirely staffed by illegals, and the starting wage was $12.85/hr. Now, the starting wage is $9.40/hr. Illegals will do the job for less. End of story. It is not a question of whether an American wants the job or not. When was the last time you heard of a company being shut down because they hired illegals? You have a good start on issues regarding business and the economy, but still have a LOT left to learn. Immigration runs a raid at IBP about every 2 years. They deport a couple hundred people. IBP pays a $5000 fine. IBP sends BUSSES down south to bring the illegals back. They also send busses down to pick up people when they need more help. Enforcement is a JOKE.","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","04:21 PM","government-debates","20"

"02-21-2004","1755",2,"None","None","None","daewoo","35433","I am a small business, and it would make a great deal of seense (on paper) for me to quite hiring Americans and switch to illegals. If I could cut my payroll employee payroll 15% by doing so, I would save about $97,000 per quarter. Of course, I already pay roughly 25% over national average. I could decrease by that 25%, which would mean an overall cut in payroll of 40%. Of course, I would have put a bunch of skilled Americans out of work, but SCREW them. If they are not willing to do the job for 40% less, it obviously means they don't WANT the job. Of course, I could also cut the money I spend on training by maybe 20%-30%, since my entry level employees would be folks who are used to working with their hands and already posess some degree of mechanical skill, as opposed to the American kids that walk in off the street around here whose high school shop equipment was long ago replaced by a computer lab and a CNC mill (which they have been taught to operate incorrectly b/c if the high school shop teacher really knew how to operate a CNC mill well, he would be off doing that for $90,000 per year instead of teaching high school kids for $45,000). How is a $5000 fine every 2 years for hiring illegals going to hurt me again? Doing the math, it looks like I could get fined $5000 every MONTH and still be money (way) ahead. But I don't, because it is not RIGHT for Americans to be out of work while we import foreigners to do their jobs. There are things that are more important than the bottom line. On this issue, Bush is either a LIAR, or an IDIOT who doesn't realize that somebody is feeding him a line of XXXX.","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","01:22 AM","government-debates","22"
"02-21-2004","1755",2,"None","None","None","Eddie","35442","Hmmm.. had a similiar discussion about this at another site. Here are my thoughts on ""job export overseas"": Manual labour loss to the overseas can indeed be good. It is a good way to make the labour force more efficient, and it also serves to be able to purchase cheaper goods. In the end it will lead to an increase in wages for manual labour the capital/labourer ratio will move in favour for the workers (assumning that the unemployment will dissipate, which is questionable). But this is assuming that the american capital will stay in the US. If the capital moves elsewhere, there will be no efficiency increase in the US. There will be no wage increase as the capital/labour ratio will stay as it where. In fact, the overall capital/labour ratio will drop (ie less capital). This will effect the overall wage rate negatively. But there will still be cheaper goods of course (possibly negating the wage rate drop), but who will be better off? While the overall american wellfare may rise (asuming that the unemployment will dissipate and that the new imports doesn`t raise the trade decifit) the workers will probably not be better off, they will most probably be worse off. The public will perhaps be better off (due to cheaper goods) but how much better off they will become is relative to their income (that is; the more you earn, the ""more"" better off you will be by this change). And of course the capital owners will be better off (otherwise they wouldn`t have moved their capital). Now, you see that there are a lot of assumptions here... If for exammple unemployment does not disipate it will be a costly affair, and if the trade decifit is made even worse it could become a problem for future generation americans. But it could be just fine and dandy as the overall change would probably be positive (providing the assumptions are correct). But if nothing is done to re-distribute the gains it will basicly lead to some get shafted and some is better off. But then we have the political implications of globally transferable capital and what it does to the democratic self-determination of the nation state. It is clear that a nations economic wealth/capita is heavily dependant on the capital/labour ratio. It is the amount of capital put into production (both humane capital and machines) that determines the productivity per worker. And as the productivity per worker decides GNP/capita a decrease in capital/labour ratio will effect the GNP/capita negativly. Now, that would mean that any government, who is concerned with the wellbeing of its citizens should maximize capital accumulation. This is pretty straightforward and could be done in many ways. But, most governments also have certain political aspirations (for example; minimum wages, social security net, defense, right to join labour unions etc), and these political aspirations will both cost money and most probable will have negative effect on the capital owners (as they are paying taxes on their capital, and seldom need to use these services). In a closed system, this will only have marginal effects on the capital accumulation. In an open system it will have much more effect as the capital can be moved to another location where these political aspirations are lower (or non-existant). And as the international system is one of anarchy, it will lead to competition between states over easy moveable capital (ie; a reduction in the political aspirations, or a reduction in the ability for a nations public to decide democraticly how their country should be like). So in essence, job flight overseas does not nearly pose as a serious problem (assuming alot of things) as capital flight and the political implications of a globally transferable capital. Phew, sorry for the rant...","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","07:00 AM","government-debates","23"

Therefore demand is high for other businesses to move in this direction. Americans begin to lose jobs and can only afford to spend less money therefore more pressure is put on companies to lower prices. The illegals send their pay across the border taking even more money from the US and pay to help ship more of their buddies over here to take advantage of our economy.

"02-22-2004","1755",2,"None","None","None","Eddie","35522","@ Daewoo Ah, yes. You are correct that some of the savings are retained by the company/share holders. But I would argue that, even though competition is never perfect, it is at least strong enough in most multinational bussineses that the prices will fall. (and thus transfer savings) Edit: I just want to point out that my description of the situation is very simplified. Labour can be divided into more catagories, as can capital. Certain events may be shaped by individual decissions or market failiures. But the trend is still true.","bush-administration-sending-jobs-overseas-good-thing","04:39 AM","government-debates","27"
