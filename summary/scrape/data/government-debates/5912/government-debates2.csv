Two 'staunch' US allies, both 180-degrees from whatever it is we're fantasizing about doing in Iraq. What is the reality of our foreign policy?","unkerpaulie","147029","then what good is reforming iraq when the coutries we are ""allies"" with are the ones executing the attacks? iraq's condition, whether run by a tyrant or a president, will be of absolutely no effect to the terrorists that are still being recruited and trained in ""our friendly"" middle-east countries. so what use is our occupation in iraq when it is blatantly futile as far as reducing terrorism?","iraqi-war","03:42 PM","government-debates","16"
"07-13-2005","5912",2,"wilted_laughter","None","Home grown terrorists are going to become an increasing problem in Europe unless steps are taken to integrate immigrant communities and keep them out of the poverty trap and the clutches of extremists spreading propoganda.","unkerpaulie","147031","so you honestly believe that by establishing a democracy in iraq, a ""land of freedom and opportunity"", that bin laden's terrorists will dramatically decrease? bear in mind that bin laden has no crucial or significant establishment or ties in iraq, and the countries that he is operating from are not targets for any type of american intervention","iraqi-war","03:48 PM","government-debates","17"

"07-14-2005","5912",2,"Ghost","None","I don't think we'll be convincing any terrorists not to fight, no. I do think we'll be dramatically reducing the number of people who are likely to follow him, or other terrorist organizations. Remember, it's not just Osama. No one ever said this is the war on Osama. So inconsequential, in fact, that now Zarqawi and the group 'al-Qaeda in Iraq' are fighting there to try and drive us out. Damn straight. Many European countries are finding that their population's are becoming more and more resentful of Muslim Arabs moving into their countries, not assimilating, and not really wishing to be part of the culture. I live in the American southwest, and this is very similar to the problems we've been having with illegal immigration from Mexico, though thankfully most Mexican illegals here aren't of the radical Islam variety.","unkerpaulie","147238","exactly. osama attacked us, and killed 3000 innocent american civilians during peace time and without warning. yet we are not at war against osama. i know this. you know this. isnt that a bit disturbing? because we invaded iraq. when somebody invades your country, its expected that the people in that country who are able to fight back would fight back. why does that sound strange to you? yet bush's plan is to surround the muslims with more american culture and hope that they would be assimilated. wow..... maybe a strategy that hasnt worked in hundreds of years will work now that bush is trying it...","iraqi-war","02:51 PM","government-debates","20"

And you seem to think that we completely forgot about him when we went to Iraq. You're wrong. We are still hunting for him, the pronblem is that it's in one of the worst landscapes on the face of the globe. Zarqawi and al-Qaeda in Iraq are not Iraqi! Most of the terrorists/insurgents/fighters in Iraq are NOT FROM IRAQ!!!! The majority of Iraqis, the Shi'ites, are not fighting the Americans. By this point I'm firmly convinced that you're not even comprehending what I'm saying. I don't think you're stupid or anything, not at all, I just don't think you're actually reading what I'm writing. We're talking first of all about two entirely different things; we were talking about immigration and the refusal of immigrants to assimilate. You're talking about Americanizing Iraq. We're not trying to export American culture to the Middle East, we're trying to allow the Iraqi people their OWN society.","iraqi-war","03:42 PM","government-debates","21"

"07-14-2005","5912",2,"unkerpaulie","None","you are joking, right? after billions of dollars and thousands of lives consumed in a vain effort to reduce terrorism from islamic fundamtalists, the same islamic fundamentalists are still launching acts of terrorism. yet you believe we should continue our current course of harrassing the iraqis and leaving bin laden free to roam and act as he pleases? wow, no wonder angelxx describes the war supporters the way she does isnt this clear evidence of what we've all known all along, that holding siege to iraq will do absolutely zilch to reduce terrorism? and before some smartass says ""well there hasnt been a terrost attack on american soil in years"" or some other XXXX like that, think for a moment. if bin laden had been captured/killed and al qaeda disabled like they should have been years ago, do you think we'd still be worried about threats like what happened in london? an attack could happen anywhere at any time, even in america, for 2 reasons 1. our intelligence has no idea what bin laden is up to 2. our intelligence has no clue to the positions and operations of al qaeda throughout the world so, with all this bloodshed in iraq, including much of our own, and all this money going up in smoke, it is all to very little avail. we have not even barely incapacitated al qaeda. they still can and will attack on their own schedule and whats worse, the american sheeple will still dumbfoundedly gleam when bush speaks of his progress on the war on terror, as though reality mens nothing and bush's words are gospel","gnojek","147295","No really, I asked, now, ""after billions of dollars and thousands of lives consumed in a vain effort to reduce terrorism from islamic fundamtalists"" we are stuck in a rut. We have to fix what we broke. If we pull out of Iraq now, it would be a disaster. If we put more resources toward finding Osama, then if we actually found him, what would that accomplish? it would make Americans feel really good for that news cycle and then the next bombing would go off. What would it accomplish? We'd have Iraq in a worse situation than we've put it and we wouldn't have done squat to end terrorism. But what would withdrawing now accomplish? Nothing. It would make things worse. Hell yes. Wouldn't you? Do you think if OBL is captured all terrorism in the world magically vanishes? 1. What does catching OBL have to do with stopping global terrorism? Not much anymore. 2. How would withdrawing troops from Iraq improve our intellegence on AQ? And this is a reason to withdraw troops now because... Well, didn't the bombings in London prove that the war on terror is working?","iraqi-war","06:25 PM","government-debates","23"

Do you wonder why hate is directed at our country and not our leadership? We're considered deceptive as a nation because our leadership made a bad call with Iraq and even though the American public bought the series of refocusing, most of the world caught us in a lie. How can we be trusted to not invade and occupy any country that disagrees with our ideology? And you wonder why smaller countries are scrambling for nuclear weapons?","iraqi-war","06:43 PM","government-debates","26"

According to the Council on Foreign Relations, they're going to Iraq to drive out the US so they can turn Iraq into a recruiting ground for jihadis. Desaix, you're probably right, the majority may be from Iraq, I was incorrect. But foreigners do make up a good sized chunk of the insurgency. At this website, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Musab_al-Zarqawi , they talk about what kind of relationship Zarqawi has with Osama and al Qaeda. As you can see, they're mutually supportive. It seems that Zarqawi just seems to head up an independant faction of al Qaeda based in Iraq. Des, you clever SOB you.
