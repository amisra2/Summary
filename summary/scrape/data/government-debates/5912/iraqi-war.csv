Anyways, its clear to me, since London was bombed today(July 08 2005), that we should get OUT of Iraq and friggin find Osama. Since Bush ""claimed"" that iraq had wmd(weapons of mass destruction) we have neglected to look for and find Osama Bin Ladin. To me, if all of the UK hates the US, I personaly wouldnt blame them. If we wouldve stuck to the first damn thing Bush said then London might not have been bombed. I mean cmon, we claim that we ""know"" were Osama is, but if that was true, dont you think we wouldve done something? I mean I know I wouldve, and I know a lot of other people who would as well. It is in my opinion that we impeech Bush because he bombed London indirectly with no provocation. Well, i just want to hear you guys' thoughts on this subject because I KNOW there are a lot of people out there who either agree, disagree, or mildy agree with this statement. Also, I know many of you will get extremly mad at me for this post, considering more than half of the public are Bush's bitches(no offence). All of the above post is my opinion and if you disagree with me, let me hear your thoughts, I love to argue and will humbly accept any debate challenge anyways wants to give me. Thanks, and have a nice day.","iraqi-war","12:20 AM","government-debates","1"

Also I would advise you to add in a coherent sentence now and then in your post, it would be a bit easier to read. Although I generally agree with what you say, you could write it so it's easier to understand. If you could avoid phrases such as ""I mean, cmon"", things you say when you talk, it would be a lot easier to read. You also just sort of ramble on, the periods seem to be randomly placed, you never know when your thought will end. I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just trying to help you to hopefully make a post that is a bit better to read and may encourage other people to read it. You put a few good thoughts down, but you seem to have a bit of trouble expressing them. Would I be right if I guessed that you are a kid still in school?","iraqi-war","12:27 AM","government-debates","2"

Still, the fact that im only 18, and still in 11th grade, doesnt effect the way I put down my thoughts. I just say them as they come. I never think in complete sentences, the words just come to me one after another. So if I didnt put enough sentences, though i saw plenty, im sorry, and if i offended your or anyone else who viewd it....well im not sorry, these are my opinions, so dont get offended. Also, thanks for tryin to help a noob debater out, I guess i need work, but i hope not that much, anyways thanks and i hope we'll ahve some good debates, because God knows[if he exists ] that I love to debate.

At least part of the time, he probably moves around quite a bit. In my opinion, based on what I've heard, he's probably in the Hindu Kush and can easily pass between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Even still, it makes sense to leave some of our SF guys there to try to snatch his accomplises or high-ranking Taliban members who might have information about his whereabouts. I don't think you understand the kind of work these people do, our special forces. They have gone places in this war and done things that you and I will never know about. And they know what they're doing. If special forces are looking for him in the Hindu Kush, then he most likely is there or people there know where he could be.

Desaix, you're probably right, the majority may be from Iraq, I was incorrect. But foreigners do make up a good sized chunk of the insurgency. At this website, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Musab_al-Zarqawi , they talk about what kind of relationship Zarqawi has with Osama and al Qaeda. As you can see, they're mutually supportive. It seems that Zarqawi just seems to head up an independant faction of al Qaeda based in Iraq. Des, you clever SOB you. It is pretty damn hard to concentrate, thanks to your avatar.","Desaix","147574","I'm afraid that article is mistaken.Zarqawi never took the bayat and while in Afghanistan ran a small camp seperate of Al-Qaeda.Zarqawi is proof of the changing face of 'Al-Qaeda',islamist's that have nothing to do with OBL's small and now destroyed group but that use the name 'Al-Qaeda' as a kind of Islamist banner to follow.","iraqi-war","05:01 PM","government-debates","34"

Why not just get it over with. I'm tired of waiting. I, however, do not fear Osama, or any other terrorist group. I fear the actions of our incapable president. He keeps provoking people over and over again. Its like hes trying to impress his dad since his dad ended the cold war. Soon, itll be wold war 3, but the allies will be the USA, Brittan, and maybe some other palces, vs everyone else. Its just ******** what we have to suffer through just to eventualy die. Whats the point in living if you have to live in fear of someone with more power than you? Oh, and we dont attack other countries that harbor terrorists because we havnt had as many problems with them as Iraq, and the sell us oil, but expect to hear from the president were attacking them soon, cuz I really think hes that stupid.

Also I would advise you to add in a coherent sentence now and then in your post, it would be a bit easier to read. Although I generally agree with what you say, Well Zachvac. It seems your grammar is less than perfect. I have no trouble in understanding the post you are refering to. I am sure that your opinion is valid so rather than give sound bites i.e. quotations which are those individuals, own turn of phrase. Give us your musings rather than your tutors comments on your assignments. Use the rich dynamic, everr changing English language, Here is a sound bite of my own ""don't let anyone put you down your opinion however expressed in words, pictures or sign language is still valid"". A good point is a good point, remember aesops fables, and the use of alogory by plato.","iraqi-war","06:22 AM","government-debates","38"
