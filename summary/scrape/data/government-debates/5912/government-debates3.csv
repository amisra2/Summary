According to the Council on Foreign Relations, they're going to Iraq to drive out the US so they can turn Iraq into a recruiting ground for jihadis. Desaix, you're probably right, the majority may be from Iraq, I was incorrect. But foreigners do make up a good sized chunk of the insurgency. At this website, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Musab_al-Zarqawi , they talk about what kind of relationship Zarqawi has with Osama and al Qaeda. As you can see, they're mutually supportive. It seems that Zarqawi just seems to head up an independant faction of al Qaeda based in Iraq. Des, you clever SOB you. It is pretty damn hard to concentrate, thanks to your avatar.","unkerpaulie","147436","according to the coucil on foreign relations? its a good analysis, but a misleading presentation. if the iraqi resistance manages to drive the americans out of iraq, that victory will indeed turn iraq into harvest of terrorist volunteers. however, its only because america invaded iraq in the first place. in saddam's 30+ years of iraqi rule, iraq was never a significant resource to terrorists. the terrorists mostly came from the saudi peninsula, egypt and north africa. undoubtedly, our chokehold on the iraqi affairs had a lot to do with that as well. now that iraq is effectively an anarchy, its anybody's war. if the americans win (which most likely they would) then iraq becomes a terrorist punching bag. if the resistance wins, iraq becomes a terrorist breeding ground. thanks a lot, america","iraqi-war","08:58 AM","government-debates","32"
"07-15-2005","5912",3,"unkerpaulie","None","no offence, but this is truly one of the most thoughtless statements i have ever read concerning the war in iraq. if by ""working"" you mean making ourselves and our allies more vulnerable to terrorist attacks, then your definition of ""working"" is very wierd. we claim to be at war with terror. yet we are not dismantling any terrorist organizations whatsoever. we are not capturing or even effectively pursuing the source of the terrorist threats and attacks. we are not intercepting attack plans. we are not reducing terrorist recruitment and training. we are not denying terrorist operatives getting materials, information, funds or mobility. so WHAT are we doing?","georged","147444","Nation building while driving our GDP. Elimination of $100-billion/yr for Afghanistan/Iraq and $58-billion/yr for homeland security, all funded by debt, would put annual GDP in a negative position. That would end consumer confidence and bring our fiscal house of cards tumbling down. Blind public emotion is a very handy tool for political purposes.","iraqi-war","09:25 AM","government-debates","33"

Why not just get it over with. I'm tired of waiting. I, however, do not fear Osama, or any other terrorist group. I fear the actions of our incapable president. He keeps provoking people over and over again. Its like hes trying to impress his dad since his dad ended the cold war. Soon, itll be wold war 3, but the allies will be the USA, Brittan, and maybe some other palces, vs everyone else. Its just ******** what we have to suffer through just to eventualy die. Whats the point in living if you have to live in fear of someone with more power than you? Oh, and we dont attack other countries that harbor terrorists because we havnt had as many problems with them as Iraq, and the sell us oil, but expect to hear from the president were attacking them soon, cuz I really think hes that stupid.

Also I would advise you to add in a coherent sentence now and then in your post, it would be a bit easier to read. Although I generally agree with what you say, Well Zachvac. It seems your grammar is less than perfect. I have no trouble in understanding the post you are refering to. I am sure that your opinion is valid so rather than give sound bites i.e. quotations which are those individuals, own turn of phrase. Give us your musings rather than your tutors comments on your assignments. Use the rich dynamic, everr changing English language, Here is a sound bite of my own ""don't let anyone put you down your opinion however expressed in words, pictures or sign language is still valid"". A good point is a good point, remember aesops fables, and the use of alogory by plato.","iraqi-war","06:22 AM","government-debates","38"
