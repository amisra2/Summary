Whoever suggested anything like a forcible taking? Last time I checked, the people's VOTES still counted for something in this country, GWB notwithstanding. When we assume electoral power and pass a truly progressive income tax, then it will be fun to watch the fat cats howl as the are finally required to pay their fair share. BTW, we're not talking about Africa. We're talking about the poor in the USA. Please, no more apples/oranges comparisons.","fraud-freemarket","12:36 PM","government-debates","50"

It is progressive right now with the top 10% paying the vast majority of total tax dollars. I'm not saying they shouldn't be taxed more as I have stated many times it's the only way to get out of debt now but chances are you only wish to tax the rich to give to the poor. This is just idiotic in my opinion. The poor in the USA are the rich almost everywhere else. It seems the only elitist here is you.","fraud-freemarket","02:48 PM","government-debates","51"

Certainly they are better off than the poorest in most developing nations (though worse off than in most developed countries), but it is hard to make a direct comparison between completely different lifestyles.","fraud-freemarket","02:58 PM","government-debates","52"

The idea that we are entitlement to everything is insulting to those in Africa or around the world who are grateful for one meal a day. And yes, I include myself in the spoiled brat category.","fraud-freemarket","04:00 PM","government-debates","53"

If you support anything consistently, it seems to be harming anyone better off than yourself out of pure spite. The poor in the US certainly seem to eat more than the rich in most countries.","fraud-freemarket","04:39 PM","government-debates","54"

I favor the elimination of the unmerited, unearned advantage of inherited wealth. From that you get that I oppose equality of opportunity. Welcome to Newspeak! BTW, I DO like little boys. My two grandsons, age 2 & 3, are precious. Not only do I like them, I LOVE them. Now, keep your sick suggestions to yourself.

Secondly, do you oppose all gifts? And why do you not support inherited wealth? Shouldn't people get to choose what to do with their money or is this another instance where you don't support choice while claiming to support it?","fraud-freemarket","09:18 PM","government-debates","56"

DEAL???","Peeling","311384","I wasn't aware I'd expressed opposition to affirmative action, so I guess you've got yourself a deal. Again, I'm not ideologically opposed to levelling the playing field: I just don't favour methods of levelling the playing field that involve digging a thousand-foot hole and pushing everyone in. As I said earlier, and Steeeeve expressed more succinctly, inheritance is a kind of gift. There are certain assumptions made when someone dies intestate, but in the end a will is merely a statement of how a person wishes their property to be distributed after their death. Unless you're going to start restricting what people can do with their property before their death, draconian inheritance taxes are entirely pointless. What are you going to do, create a government department that decides whether any given child merits the gifts his or her parents provide for him? The Ministry of Fairness, perhaps?","fraud-freemarket","08:32 AM","government-debates","57"

When they die, it's no longer theirs in a society dedicated to equality of opportunity.
