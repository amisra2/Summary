This is impossible to achieve anyway and frankly a stupid policy which would hurt economic growth and probably stall our economy.","chester","312004","Gee, and here I thought that an American value was equality of opportunity. Why not tell us just what Americans you would consign to be hewers of wood and drawers of water. While you are at it, please also tell us what groups you give a head start to and what they have done to deserve it.","fraud-freemarket","11:46 AM","government-debates","61"

This is impossible to achieve anyway and frankly a stupid policy which would hurt economic growth and probably stall our economy. is the argument you presented. Now, since you declare that it is ""a stupid policy"" that everyone start ""at the same place"" why not tell us just who you would consign to the back of the pack and who you would have be at its head. What are the criteria you would use in making that determination?","fraud-freemarket","09:26 PM","government-debates","63"
"05-28-2008","10781",5,"None","None","None","Symbiote","312046","The beauty of the free market is that it doesn't require a totalitarian overlord assigning everyone their place. Your problem is you assume there will be a dictator, a ""Decider"" in the words of George W Bush, and then you imagine yourself that dictator, and think about all the things you would do with your Power. Who would you reward, who would you punish, who would live and who would die? The question isn't ""What should the dicator do"", it's ""Should there be one at all"".","fraud-freemarket","05:56 AM","government-debates","64"

The question isn't ""What should the dicator do"", it's ""Should there be one at all"".","Jo Bennett","312048","No, the question is ""how do we make decisions"". There will always be someone making decisions. Right now it's an oligarchy heading the world's largest corporations, looking out for their own interests. There's no reason control shouldn't be in the hands of democratically elected representatives.","fraud-freemarket","06:40 AM","government-debates","65"
"05-28-2008","10781",5,"Symbiote","312049","Is this the Borg argument for dictatorship - ""resistance is futile"". I chose what I ate this morning, there wasn't a politician that decided that for me. If there were, I shouldn't care the least whether it was democratically elected or not. And your answer is ""we don't need to make decisions, the government will tell us what is best and right"".","Jo Bennett","312057","strawmen, strawmen everywhere. Decisions are already made about what to produce, what is seen on television, what infrastructure gets built. The decisions are made, whether process is formalised or not. When decisions are made that affect everyone, it's not unreasonable that everyone should have some say in that decision.","fraud-freemarket","10:45 AM","government-debates","67"

To think I am arguing for a system where government decided directly who will be where is just a strawman argument.","fraud-freemarket","05:44 PM","government-debates","68"

Thanks for consigning my inner-city Latino students to the back of the pack. Please tip them well for the good job they do in cleaning your fancy $350 per night hotel room. It might help them keep their families in rice and beans.","fraud-freemarket","08:08 AM","government-debates","69"
