The Blinding Fraud of Pure Economics or Freemarkets According to narcissistic economists solitarily beating their logarithms and algorithms in their lab corners (Chicago School of Economics, Carnegie Institute), the whole world can be 'structurally adjusted' by a calculator: if only the market was free of DISTORTIONS, they feverishly ejaculate! This is the Golden Mean of scientific economics. The cardinal ingredient of the freemarket and the junk science of economics is of course the holy variable of self-interest. This mostly anglo (Smithian) principle is worshiped by all rightwing / pure economists, (all of whom are naturally fat and wanting for nothing except a social consciousness) who fantasize of a world where self-interest is freed from the inhibiting forces of market distortions, e.g. social security, minimum wage, incubators for newborns, subsidized medicines etc. Remove such distortions they claim, and after a little compulsory bloodletting the market will find its equilibrium with the quirky white plump invisible hand revealing itself. The problem / fraud with this doctrine is of course, any psychotic economist ala Friedman will insist the hated State must retain the appendages of police and army to keep the freemarket free by stomping on the victims of the 'freemarket'! Can you see the hypocrisy, the fraud, the distortion! If free market forces are to be truly free in the libertarian nirvana, then the freemarket force of resistance by the masses struggling for their own SELF-INTEREST must not be distorted by the boot and baton of the very distorted and manufactured variable of military and police violence. Can you now see the astronomical lie of Friedmans freemarket forces: stand down your military / police stooges and cast them back among the poor masses, and then introduce the freemarket. It is guaranteed you Chicago School of psychotics, the market will truly be free, and the most left leaning loopy poor panhandler will embrace this freemarket. And as for Keynes, that bleeding heart bourgeoisie, as with all who squat quivering in between the lines, he was part of the problem.","fraud-freemarket","07:06 AM","government-debates","1"

It's been born into them from their fathers and forefathers, some even by occults like the Illuminati. There will never be a free market with limited owners and limited businesses allowed to compete against them. Government creates false markets supposedly keeping things fair, but they are just bankrupiting farmers making them grow cheap crops and allowing other rich farmers to grow the richer crops.

Witness the antitrust lawsuits against Microsoft for example, the lesson learned by Microsoft was that they should buy more political clout, because it was their competitors driving political power against them. A ""robber baron"" is a capitalist who steals from the public via government privilege, if you want to prevent robber barons, stop the government deciding who profits. The robber barons of today are the military support and oil corporations profiting from the Iraq debacle because of government connections. The thing to remember is that the market is pretty much impersonal. You jail one drug dealer, three more take their place. You fine one robber baron, three more take theirs. And they adapt. The next generation are more sophisticated and more harmful than the last, and an institution as bloated and inefficient as the government cannot possibly keep pace with the dynamism of the market. The only practical solution is to destroy the corruption at its source. If you want to abolish drug dealers and their associated violent crime, repeal prohibition. If you want to abolish robber barons, repeal the ability of judges and politicians to decree profit. Anything else is at best naive, more commonly a cynical exploitation of the population facilitated by useful XXXXXX, to benefit an elite politically connected few.","fraud-freemarket","07:03 AM","government-debates","5"

Too little government competence in producing a proper capitalistic framework is the problem. The size of the government is rather irrelevant. It is how the government sets up its framework for regulation that matters. bhbcu64, the form of capitalism under Bush is hardly natural selection. The Bush administration has favored massive subsidies for agriculture and fossil fuel. That is anti-natural selection. Furthermore, the no-bidding contracts that have flown of the pentagon are again, not natural selection. Here Symbiote is right, government ties have allowed companies to profit in excess of what the natural state of the market would allow. Government ties have effectively created a client-patron system, which is detrimental to whoever is paying the bill.

SO grew organically that way initially and then switched over to buying every firm that it could both horizontally and vertically. By achieving monopoly status, it could charge whatever it wanted similar to how MS could with its office products. Office Ultimate right now is over $650. Seriously.

"04-04-2008","10781",1,"None","None","None","Symbiote","307596","That's what textbook economics would predict, but the mainstream definition of monopoly is so incoherent it's no surprise the reality is a far different ballgame. I'm not aware of Standard Oil ever charging obscene prices for its oil, it grew by consistently and rapidly producing oil at much cheaper rates than its competitors. It never gained total control of the market, it gained a huge proportion of it until its competitors adopted its methods, and then its market share declined - it did not have further innovation to offer that would allow it to cut prices below its modernised efficient competitors. Companies like Shell and Texaco saw the profit opportunity, revealed by Standard Oil's rapid growth, and jumped at it. It was prosecuted because its politically connected competitors were envious of its profitability, and could not compete on market terms. Ida Tarbell who bhbcu64 cites is the daughter of a man who did charge high prices for oil, and was ultimately unable to compete with the more efficient operations of Standard Oil. Yes, there were ""robber barons"" in this same era, the politically connected railroad owners for example who built shoddy tracks to nowhere in order to collect government subsidy. To act as if these are legitimate businessmen, and those who produce a product for consumers at a lower price than anyone else at the time are robbers is a completely upside down picture of reality. Let's suppose I'm living in the era of Standard Oil's near monopoly, they've ""dumped"" a whole tonne of oil on the market at low low prices to gain market share, and I suspect in two years, once they've gained control, they will jack up the price. And let's suppose I have a lot of money, for whatever reason. Why don't I seize this opportunity to buy as much of Standard Oil's cheap oil as I can, then sell it back to the public 2 years later? If my ideas about Monopoly are correct, not only will I make extraodinary profits from my insights, but also force Standard Oil to lower their prices to compete with me, thus ruining their own anticipated profits. As a strategy, trying to monopolise a resource to jack up the price is at best misguided. The only case I can recall it happening was with copper, and the company in question made good profits for a short while before people switched to other metals and they went broke. If monopoly theorists are sincere, and not merely trying to hurt an organisation they dislike, they can put their money where their mouths are.","fraud-freemarket","07:17 PM","government-debates","10"

The fly in your ointment is simply this. In your hypo, Standard Oil controls such a vast supply that it can undercut your price for so long as it takes to drive you out of business.

If you'd been good looking, or unusually bright, that would be OK, but, well, those are the breaks. Nor is it possible to discern, ultimately, between equality of outcome and equality of opportunity. At any given moment our opportunities lie ahead of us, their scope defined by our current circumstances. Impose equality of opportunity and you necessarily impose equality of outcome thus far. But still, the really weird thing is that you're still not really talking about equality, you're just drawing a line and saying 'everything on this side is a legitimate inherent advantage'. That's what everyone does - you have no real ideological high-ground to occupy, so what makes your version practically superior? By the way, if I'm going to keep arguing the ideological angle, it would be nice if you'd reciprocate and acknowledge the question of practicality.","fraud-freemarket","10:15 AM","government-debates","36"

"05-14-2008","10781",3,"Peeling","310926","This strikes me as an ideological 'problem' rather than a practical one. To undertake some ventures you need a large chunk of seed capital. To undertake high-risk ventures you need to be able to afford to lose that capital. By hauling everyone back to the same starting blocks you make it much, much harder for anyone to invest speculatively. And surely the same is true of inherited good looks, or any other inherited physical or mental attributes. Have you read any Kurt Vonnegut? If not I encourage you to do so; he has a wonderful take on the kind of state-enforced equality you're talking about. You're still not thinking it through. There's no reason to suppose any substantial part of such large estates will be liquid. Say an estate is valued at $15m - so now you're slapping the family with a tax bill of $10m. How do they pay it? Sell off the company, presumably. New owners - most likely investment sharks looking to buy at fire-sale prices, massive upheaval for the company, possible liquidation, job losses... All of which is frankly moot because of the other practical problems you've so far ignored. Instituting a 100% inheritance tax will just drive all the wealth out of the country; the government won't see a dime of anything over your $5m cap. Come up with anything on the spousal inheritance issue yet?
