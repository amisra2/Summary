It would turn my stomach to get rich on the labor of others. On the other hand, too bad that you equate success with business and riches. You channel Gordon Gecko and, along the way, exemplify much that is wrong with America.","fraud-freemarket","07:43 PM","government-debates","17"
"05-08-2008","10781",2,"None","None","None","Peeling","310641","Now try applying the same 'stockpile and cash in' arguments to companies which provide services or supply perishables - the latter category including pretty much any technology. Your scenario also presumes equal access to the market for all. A monopoly can spend more on advertising, offer lucrative exclusivity deals, cross-subsidize its monopolistic efforts via other market sectors. Does political regulation of the market lead to corruption? Yep. Does removing it solve the problem? Nope. The only difference is which l33t h4x large companies need to use to exploit the system. However, at least with a system of political regulation corruption is, in fact, corruption: those involved are doing something wrong and can in principle be caught and held accountable. A scenario where big business could literally do no wrong doesn't bear thinking about.","fraud-freemarket","11:45 AM","government-debates","18"
"05-09-2008","10781",2,"None","None","None","Symbiote","310682","A free market isn't a system where big business ""can do no wrong"", it's a system where violence is prohibited. Regulation of markets allows business to take violent action by political means, it is where big business can do no wrong as long as they can convince a politician to allow them to do it.","fraud-freemarket","04:51 AM","government-debates","19"

Big business has many more anticompetitive options open to it than 'be violent'. I even outlined a few of them for you. A powerful monopoly can find the cheapest link in the chain connecting you to your potential market, and pay to break it. Or it can simply be one of the links to your market, and render you artificially uncompetitive. The free market is a bit like Natural Selection: it's good for the species as a whole but really sucks for the individuals involved, so there's a strong incentive for powerful individuals (businesses) to stack the deck in their favour. Legislation is designed to preserve the 'big picture' benefits the free market brings to us all. It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing. What do you think is going to happen if you make it legal to break the free market?","fraud-freemarket","09:55 AM","government-debates","20"

If there were, we would not have seen the US government running to aid corporations over the years that run from Chrysler in the 1970's to the S&L's after the President's brother's raid to Bear Stearns last month. Whether one is a Marxist or not, one must certainly agree with his observation that law exists to serve the interests of the ruling class.","fraud-freemarket","07:46 AM","government-debates","22"
"05-12-2008","10781",2,"Symbiote","310703","It is generally designed by big business, for the exclusive benefit of big business.","Peeling","310835","Well, no, but I admit 'designed' was a poor choice of term. Better to say that the principle upon which legislation may be justified is the preservation of the big-picture free market benefits. Whether each individual piece of legislation is designed with that in mind is something else entirely - some certainly are. You said yourself violence must be prohibited. But why? If violence is an option available to all, surely the free market should just magically work itself out the way you expect every other problem to disappear. What about fraud? I expect you would agree legislation against that is also necessary. Clearly we agree there are problems a free market cannot solve if just left to its own devices. All I'm saying is that there are a few more weaknesses which must be shored up. The potential for coercive monopolies is one of them. Recognising that doesn't make me anti-free-market, it makes me pro free-market, as in I want it to remain functional, competitive, and serving my best interests.","fraud-freemarket","10:35 AM","government-debates","23"

One could argue that tax is less of a burden to him, but then the same could be said for buying milk - should he therefore be charged a thousand times as much for dairy products just to even things out? In any case, I didn't say that any particular laws were good or bad, only what they are for: expressing the ways in which it is permissible to succeed in life.","fraud-freemarket","12:12 PM","government-debates","26"

The laws make it possible for those who have already succeeded to stay on top. If the USA were really the country of equal opportunity we like to say it is, estates would be taxed at 100% of their value. That way, the race would really go the the best of the best, because everyone would start at the same place.","fraud-freemarket","12:45 PM","government-debates","27"

How could a free market work otherwise? Believe it or not, rich people are actually useful. Historically it has been the rich who have sponsored or undertaken scientific research, for example, and that rising tide has lifted most boats in return. The idea that everything would be better if we divvied up the possessions of the rich among everyone is hopelessly naive. All that happens is that you make a lot of people a little better off short term, at the expense of eliminating your sources of future investment and development long term.","fraud-freemarket","10:20 AM","government-debates","28"

You sound like Herbert Spencer and the other social Darwinists. Veblin is more my style, thank you. That is why, among other reforms that are necessary, desirable, and practical is a 100% inheritance tax. If everyone comes to the line as equals, then merit will win out in the end.","fraud-freemarket","12:03 PM","government-debates","29"

Newsflash: yours is not the only country in the world. Think it through When you're done, ask yourself whether spouses can inherit. No? So you're planning to toss Mr House Husband or Mrs House Wife out onto the street, homeless, should their partner die. Oh, wait, spouses can inherit? Welcome to a world where grannies marry twenty-year-olds in order to secure the future for their own children. And what exactly prevents parents putting money or assets in their childrens' names before they die? Or are you planning to instigate a 100% tax on Christmas presents too? Sorry Johnny, but that bike your parents bought you will have to go because it represents an unfair competitive advantage you didn't personally earn. Presumably at least some of this 100% inheritance tax is fed into a social fund to give each new baby the same start in life, yes? Except - oh dear! The wealth of the economy, and the birth rate, and inflation, aren't constant. So you won't always be able to afford to give all new babies/adults the same start in life, year on year. Not to mention that you have, at a stroke, undone all the progress modern society has made in terms of population control and improving per-child investment. What baffles me is that you seem to think this is all somehow necessary. What problem do you see this solving?","fraud-freemarket","08:37 PM","government-debates","30"
