If there were, we would not have seen the US government running to aid corporations over the years that run from Chrysler in the 1970's to the S&L's after the President's brother's raid to Bear Stearns last month.

One could argue that tax is less of a burden to him, but then the same could be said for buying milk - should he therefore be charged a thousand times as much for dairy products just to even things out? In any case, I didn't say that any particular laws were good or bad, only what they are for: expressing the ways in which it is permissible to succeed in life.","fraud-freemarket","12:12 PM","government-debates","101"

The laws make it possible for those who have already succeeded to stay on top. If the USA were really the country of equal opportunity we like to say it is, estates would be taxed at 100% of their value. That way, the race would really go the the best of the best, because everyone would start at the same place.","fraud-freemarket","12:45 PM","government-debates","76"

How could a free market work otherwise? Believe it or not, rich people are actually useful. Historically it has been the rich who have sponsored or undertaken scientific research, for example, and that rising tide has lifted most boats in return. The idea that everything would be better if we divvied up the possessions of the rich among everyone is hopelessly naive. All that happens is that you make a lot of people a little better off short term, at the expense of eliminating your sources of future investment and development long term.","fraud-freemarket","10:20 AM","government-debates","115"

You sound like Herbert Spencer and the other social Darwinists. Veblin is more my style, thank you. That is why, among other reforms that are necessary, desirable, and practical is a 100% inheritance tax. If everyone comes to the line as equals, then merit will win out in the end.","fraud-freemarket","12:03 PM","government-debates","115"

If everyone comes to the line as equals, then merit will win out in the end.","Peeling","310920","You seriously think a 100% inheritance tax is practical? Newsflash: yours is not the only country in the world. Think it through When you're done, ask yourself whether spouses can inherit. No? So you're planning to toss Mr House Husband or Mrs House Wife out onto the street, homeless, should their partner die. Oh, wait, spouses can inherit? Welcome to a world where grannies marry twenty-year-olds in order to secure the future for their own children. And what exactly prevents parents putting money or assets in their childrens' names before they die? Or are you planning to instigate a 100% tax on Christmas presents too? Sorry Johnny, but that bike your parents bought you will have to go because it represents an unfair competitive advantage you didn't personally earn. Presumably at least some of this 100% inheritance tax is fed into a social fund to give each new baby the same start in life, yes? Except - oh dear! The wealth of the economy, and the birth rate, and inflation, aren't constant. So you won't always be able to afford to give all new babies/adults the same start in life, year on year. Not to mention that you have, at a stroke, undone all the progress modern society has made in terms of population control and improving per-child investment. What baffles me is that you seem to think this is all somehow necessary. What problem do you see this solving?","fraud-freemarket","08:37 PM","government-debates","274"

What problem do you see this solving?","chester","310921","It solves the problem of some folks in the land of equality of opportunity getting the unearned, unmerited advantage of inherited wealth. Surely you recognize the words; they're the same ones that are used to oppose race-based affirmative action programs. If those programs are to be attacked because critics say they give an unearned, unmerited advantage to one class of Americans, surely the same is true of inherited wealth. To err on the side of generosity, perhaps we could exempt the first, say, $5M of an estate from the 100% tax. Surely that would give grannie enough to live on in her declining years wouldn't you think?","fraud-freemarket","08:54 PM","government-debates","120"

To undertake some ventures you need a large chunk of seed capital. To undertake high-risk ventures you need to be able to afford to lose that capital. By hauling everyone back to the same starting blocks you make it much, much harder for anyone to invest speculatively. And surely the same is true of inherited good looks, or any other inherited physical or mental attributes. Have you read any Kurt Vonnegut? If not I encourage you to do so; he has a wonderful take on the kind of state-enforced equality you're talking about. You're still not thinking it through. There's no reason to suppose any substantial part of such large estates will be liquid. Say an estate is valued at $15m - so now you're slapping the family with a tax bill of $10m. How do they pay it? Sell off the company, presumably. New owners - most likely investment sharks looking to buy at fire-sale prices, massive upheaval for the company, possible liquidation, job losses... All of which is frankly moot because of the other practical problems you've so far ignored. Instituting a 100% inheritance tax will just drive all the wealth out of the country; the government won't see a dime of anything over your $5m cap. Come up with anything on the spousal inheritance issue yet? Or is 'toss em naked into the street' your final answer?","fraud-freemarket","05:01 AM","government-debates","274"

Secondly, do you oppose all gifts? And why do you not support inherited wealth? Shouldn't people get to choose what to do with their money or is this another instance where you don't support choice while claiming to support it?","fraud-freemarket","09:18 PM","government-debates","70"
