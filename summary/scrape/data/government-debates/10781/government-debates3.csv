What problem do you see this solving?","chester","310921","It solves the problem of some folks in the land of equality of opportunity getting the unearned, unmerited advantage of inherited wealth. Surely you recognize the words; they're the same ones that are used to oppose race-based affirmative action programs. If those programs are to be attacked because critics say they give an unearned, unmerited advantage to one class of Americans, surely the same is true of inherited wealth. To err on the side of generosity, perhaps we could exempt the first, say, $5M of an estate from the 100% tax. Surely that would give grannie enough to live on in her declining years wouldn't you think?","fraud-freemarket","08:54 PM","government-debates","31"

To undertake some ventures you need a large chunk of seed capital. To undertake high-risk ventures you need to be able to afford to lose that capital. By hauling everyone back to the same starting blocks you make it much, much harder for anyone to invest speculatively. And surely the same is true of inherited good looks, or any other inherited physical or mental attributes. Have you read any Kurt Vonnegut? If not I encourage you to do so; he has a wonderful take on the kind of state-enforced equality you're talking about. You're still not thinking it through. There's no reason to suppose any substantial part of such large estates will be liquid. Say an estate is valued at $15m - so now you're slapping the family with a tax bill of $10m. How do they pay it? Sell off the company, presumably. New owners - most likely investment sharks looking to buy at fire-sale prices, massive upheaval for the company, possible liquidation, job losses... All of which is frankly moot because of the other practical problems you've so far ignored. Instituting a 100% inheritance tax will just drive all the wealth out of the country; the government won't see a dime of anything over your $5m cap. Come up with anything on the spousal inheritance issue yet? Or is 'toss em naked into the street' your final answer?","fraud-freemarket","05:01 AM","government-debates","32"

Have you read any Kurt Vonnegut? If not I encourage you to do so; he has a wonderful take on the kind of state-enforced equality you're talking about. You are obviously talking about Vonnegut's Harrison Bergeron, , which I use in my civics classes. On the other hand, you are dead wrong about the message of that story. Vonnegut was dealing with equality of outcome in that story when he placed bags of lead shot around George Bergeron's neck and all the shackles on Harrison. My thesis begins with the concept of equality of opportunity , which is the polar opposite of Vonnegut's message.","fraud-freemarket","06:47 AM","government-debates","33"

Equality of opportunity necessarily involves the right to fail.

Why single out money as being an unfair inherited advantage? To me, money is just one of the tools a person has to work with in life. It doesn't strike me as especially fair to say to someone 'OK, I've arbitrarily decided that the specific advantages you were born with are unfair, so I'm going to take them off you. Sorry. If you'd been good looking, or unusually bright, that would be OK, but, well, those are the breaks. Nor is it possible to discern, ultimately, between equality of outcome and equality of opportunity. At any given moment our opportunities lie ahead of us, their scope defined by our current circumstances. Impose equality of opportunity and you necessarily impose equality of outcome thus far. But still, the really weird thing is that you're still not really talking about equality, you're just drawing a line and saying 'everything on this side is a legitimate inherent advantage'. That's what everyone does - you have no real ideological high-ground to occupy, so what makes your version practically superior? By the way, if I'm going to keep arguing the ideological angle, it would be nice if you'd reciprocate and acknowledge the question of practicality.","fraud-freemarket","10:15 AM","government-debates","36"

The whole idea of inheritance tax is abhorant, taxing companies would be a better solution but you have to balance it with benefits for the companies to stay (or move in) generally this will take the form of deregulation which is something else socialists tend to be edgy about, possibly with good reason given the environmental damage caused by industrial waste.","fraud-freemarket","04:56 PM","government-debates","39"

Their shareholders may be, but that won't be affected by the place of registration, only by the domicile of the shareholder. Companies relocate to avoid corporation tax (and indeed anything else they can). If anything raising inheritance tax and cutting personal income tax and corporation tax would remove a lot of the incentive to be registered offshore.","fraud-freemarket","12:27 AM","government-debates","42"

The thrust of my argument is simply that ideological imperatives about how things should be now can often fail to account for the future. Yes, of course it's right and proper that everyone should get an equal start in life - but then that's not really an option on a number of levels. And on the levels which are optional, such as inherited wealth, the immediate redress of balance ought to be weighed against its effect on the cumulative prosperity of future generations. To put it another way, enforcing equality now isn't much use if it means that everyone is worse off in the future than they would have been if inequality had been allowed to persist.","fraud-freemarket","06:06 PM","government-debates","43"

Equally likely based upon what? So far I haven't seen much in the way of structured reasoning, just an assumption that ideological rectitude must lead to utopia. Where's your evidence that entrepreneurship is currently being repressed? Inherited money isn't used against entrepreneurs, it's used to fund them. Who exactly is going to invest in men and women with great ideas if you make everyone equally poor? I don't for one moment believe that if you had any significant net worth you would cheerfully allow the government to seize it all upon your death and impoverish your family, forcing them to leave the home you had provided for them. You would move your money, and your family if necessary, out of the country. I say this with complete confidence because the sort of person with the drive to succeed at that kind of level is not the sort of person who is going to hand over the fruits of his success without a fight. Whether or not you are that sort of person is moot The simple fact is that many people already take their money - and themselves - offshore to avoid paying large amounts of tax. It's not rocket science to extrapolate what would happen if that tax rose to 100%.","fraud-freemarket","05:37 AM","government-debates","45"
