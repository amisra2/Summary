"06-29-2003","734",2,"None","None","None","SilentPoet","11232","I thought I might share another example of the misplaced concentration of our ""news"" today. I was watching Fox, Cnn or something of the sorts and they began discussing something along the lines of the Laci Peterson case. So of everything happening in the world, of all the wars, famine, disease, corruption, and much more news worthy issues they decide to cover one murder case and speculate about it for around 20 minutes. At the bottom of the tv words were going by of other things happening in the world. Liberia (sp) is going through a war which at the time rebels controlled 60% of the country and were currently fighting for the capital. Thats at the bottom of the screen in small font. The Laci Peterson case gets twenty minutes while rebels seizing control of a country gets 7 seconds across the bottom of the screen. Thanks for reading this Always Stay Open Minded","americans","01:44 AM","government-debates","19"
"06-29-2003","734",2,"None","None","None","Broker","11263","I'm surprised Liberia didn't get more coverage... not because it's being seized by rebels (it's Africa... that is not new at all. The Simpsons did it best when the name of the country changed three times in about thirty seconds), but because it's a de facto former colony. I mean, there's often a good amount of coverage in the Philippines when something happens...","americans","06:26 PM","government-debates","20"
"11-16-2003","734",2,"None","None","None","blackhawkflyer","22808","I do believe that american media covers what it should, but i also believe that the american media covers what it can, our government doesnt want america watching a story on how poor africa is and how there children are suffering. if that were to happen then americans would put more pressure on our government, our government does not want to deal with a nation who's primary goal is to save the hungry in some foreign country. Amerca's government obviously has some say in what goes on americans t.v.'s all over in millions of homes and if the media has story only on foreign affairs then that is all americans will care about, i believe that the media and the government want to keep our news primarily nation based not world based --Black hawk flyer Peace is an illusion only to the one who sees it.","americans","12:14 AM","government-debates","21"

It's biggest in Europe... not hard to see why. Without Russia included, the US is as big as Europe. Do any of those European countries even have more than 100 million people? We have 300 million. If the US was 30 or 40 countries, it would be the same thing.","americans","07:12 PM","government-debates","22"
"12-22-2003","734",2,"None","None","None","witzelcheck","28789","As Americans (not all of us) we want to see violence, betrayal, death, and anything that seems impossible. We like to see negative things too. I see the news and I see a big tragedy. There are more good things going on, but for some reason we don't like to see them. Don't know why, really. We would be a lot happier as a people if we weren't convinced that our world was going to hell. When we see action, and something that get's a battle rage building inside of us, we want to see more. So they show us more. After all, it's what we pay to see. America's all about the money.","americans","02:52 AM","government-debates","23"
