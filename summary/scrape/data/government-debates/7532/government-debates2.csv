They have had almost 8 years of bad illegal politics from Bush that most presidents would have been impeached for, but only one or two wasted efforts to impeach him from Congress who has the power. The president is the fall buy, and deserving of the hatred anyways, for congress who should be held responsible for all the things Bush has done. They should be impeached for not doing their job to protect the constitution. If Congress was really a powerful house, why is Bush still sitting in office? I think they are weak pieces of nothing who want their face on/in a dollar, penny, postage stamp, and history books.","has-congress-become-more-stronger-then-presidency","03:34 AM","government-debates","17"
