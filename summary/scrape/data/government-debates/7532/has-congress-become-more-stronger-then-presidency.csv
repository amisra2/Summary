But today i learn our Constitution makes Congress the most powerful branch of government. Is this a good thing? or a bad? i thought that the framers made the three branch of government coequal, to keep the three branch in check with each other","has-congress-become-more-stronger-then-presidency","08:11 PM","government-debates","1"

It is to the courts that we should look for the protection or are civil liberties. Congress is filled with a majority party that wants to shove their outdated religious morals upon americans. The president proudly brags of spying on american citizens, torturing captives, holding people without trial and charge. Congress and the president have failed to uphold my rights and have actively sought to work against the best intrests of my family.","has-congress-become-more-stronger-then-presidency","06:20 AM","government-debates","2"

I do notice that conservatives sometimes run to the courts faster then any liberal on issues where the majority are against them. In california last year the governor vetoed a marriage bill passed by the legislature stating he believed the courts should decide on marraige. In 2000 elections Shrub turned to the courts when he didn't like how the election was going. In Oregan the voters passed assisted suicide law, the Shrubs administration turned to the courts to over turn the will of the people. The same could be said for all the laws passed by the people concerning medical marajuna once again the conservatives turn to the courts to overturn the will of the people. The difference seems to be that liberals are at least honest in their use of the courts while the conservatives rile against what they call activist jusdes while turning to these same judges to overturn laws they do not like.","has-congress-become-more-stronger-then-presidency","12:17 PM","government-debates","9"

They are supposed interpret the law as written by the legislature. You may think they are neutral now but as more and more people realize that there is power in the courts (we are letting them redefine laws and act on what the people who wrote the laws ""meant"". What happened to interpreting what they said?), more and more Presidents will nominate people with their point of view rather than pick the best person for the job. Obviously point of view is always a factor, but in the past I think people tried to pick people who would fairly interpret what is written in the Constitution, rather than serve their political agenda, which I can see happening more and more in the future, for Republicans and Democrats.","has-congress-become-more-stronger-then-presidency","07:11 PM","government-debates","10"

You would rather the courts define unjust? If it goes against the Constitution then it IS the responsibility of the courts to strike it down. But if it's simply unjust in your eyes, but isn't in the majority of the citizens' or the legislatures' eyes, you're out of luck. Start spreading the word, protesting, and writing petitions. Why have laws if at any time a judge can simply rule that a law is ""unjust""? What if one judge (or 5/9 of the justices on the Supreme Court) decided that putting people in prison for murder was unjust. There's nothing we can do about it until they die. Not their job to do, it's the legislatures' job. You wanna change that? Well I suspect you know already. 2/3 of the Senate and house, and 3/4 of the states.","has-congress-become-more-stronger-then-presidency","06:38 PM","government-debates","14"

They have had almost 8 years of bad illegal politics from Bush that most presidents would have been impeached for, but only one or two wasted efforts to impeach him from Congress who has the power. The president is the fall buy, and deserving of the hatred anyways, for congress who should be held responsible for all the things Bush has done. They should be impeached for not doing their job to protect the constitution. If Congress was really a powerful house, why is Bush still sitting in office? I think they are weak pieces of nothing who want their face on/in a dollar, penny, postage stamp, and history books.","has-congress-become-more-stronger-then-presidency","03:34 AM","government-debates","17"
