"03-23-2005","4606",3,"Mach","None","That sounds like a different debate. You are supporting NOT disbanding the military, only changing it's function (And composition/training, etc.) The new question is, what advantages do we enjoy having an offensive army (vs a much more defensive one). Rogue nations develop nuclear weapons and delivery systems. They could use them (on us or anyone, either) They could lose them (to terrorists, to other countries, to individuals) What are you doing to stop this? Send in the militia? The U.S. doesn't sit on it's hands and watch our enemies grow, arm, and attack. Rather, we make sure we stop it before it starts. It's either passive, or active. We choose in active role in our nation's security. For that reason alone, an offensive military, that gets used, is required. I never claimed wholly, and didn't imply it. Being corrupt AND having no military is still worse than being corrupt and HAVING a large military, in terms of vulnerability. Every nation that has ever been taken over after having been beaten in war, or without being able to defend itself. Costs? Why did Osama crash the towers? For money? Aha, money isn't the only driving force for human-kind...how novel. But we aren't going for conquest, whent's the last time we added land to the U.S. through warfare? Are we posturing for that? Enforcing our will on other countries with our military is not the same as conquest. Lastly, with MANY countries, the U.S. makes agreements that place the U.S. firmly in the role of ""security provider"". We own the military for many countries, almost literally. To dismantle that would dismantle a lot more than just ""our own security"", it would unravel the security of the world....and the vaccuum would be filled. A known good - America has the biggest and baddest military, works to reduce threats to the U.S. and our allies, proactively.","daewoo","100964","Exactly. While this woudl certainly mean disbanding large parts fo the military, I woudl certainly adovcate leaving a defensive force intact. Well, lets compare the sucess we had in regards to north korea with the sucess the Europeans have had with the iranians. We fought nuclear production in N korea for years, and now they have the bomb. The europeans have been talking to the IRanians fro a couple of years now, an the iranians have agreed not to build the bomb. When you take a military hardline against nations, you force them into a defensive position. When it is the US doing the forcing, they really have no choice but to try to develop nukes, since conventional forces have no chance against our massive miklitary machine. Frankly, since the stated policy of the US as far as nuclear weapons is concerend is one of like force (i.e you use nukes, we will too), the sugegstion that rogue nations are going to be running around nuking people is simply foolish. You really think N korae is going to do a first strike using a nuke when they know full well that the second strike in the engagement will be a half dozen titan 4 missiles, each with 10- 100 kt warheads coming screeching out of the sky to wipe their entire country off the map? What we are trying to do regarding nuclear weapons is put the genie back in the bottle. It simply doesn't work. Fortunatly, nuclear weapons are the most devetatingly worthless devices on the planet, unless you are the ONLY one who has them. No nation is foolish enough to use one, since it would unquestionably be the end of their nation. But, our offensive military keeps loosing wars. Fighting wars overseas, besides being obscenely expensive, doesn't seem to do much for you besides garner ill will. Economic incentives have proven MUCH more effective than military intervention. so, lets change it from wholly external pressures to ""primarily external pressures"". Empires fall due to mismanagement. End of story. He also didn't try to invade the united states. He had some planes flown into the towers. Our massive military couldn't do a damn thing to stop that, and still can't. That is one of the costs of being the bully onthe block. Occasionally somebody will stand up to you and bloody your nose. The real ""value"" of BLs ""accomplishment"", besides the trillions that he cost us, is the fatc that he showed tghat it CAN BE DONE. You CAN hit america and get away with it and livew to fight another day, because for all our power, and all our money, and all our military, we still can't find a 6' tall arab in pakistan with a dialysis machine. He has one of the best known faces in the arab world (and did before the attacks), and in spite of a massive bounty on his head, we can't get anybody to turn him in. Sure it is. Whether you actually annex the smaller nation and make it the 51st state, or just install a puppet government and run it remotely, it is the same thing. You are still maintaining control. From a practical standpoint, installing a puppet government is a more complete conquest than simple annexation. If you annex them, your peopel have rights, you are bound by the laws of the united states. If you just install a puppet government and rule by proxy, there are no ""rights"" for the people. Instead of having to deal with minimum wage laws, federal workplace standards, etc....US corporations are more than welcome to open sweat shops and employ children to do dangerous jobs for pennies per hour. ============= Yes, all over the world we have ensured that weak and tyrannical governments have stayed in power, thus ensuring that places like S America and Africa will always remain in their place.......a supplier of cheap natural resources and a possible future location for a Nike sweat shop. OR, works to create threats proactively. HAve you not noticed how many nations are now developing nuclear weapons in response to our recent agression? Even the egyptians have announced they plan to develope nukes to protect themselves from the US.","disbanding-military","10:48 PM","government-debates","31"
"03-24-2005","4606",3,"Mach","None","But I think that's the goal. Stop nuclear proliferation because we don't trust anyone else with them. The only way to do this is through enforcement. The alternative...non-enforcement, simply isn't a rational approach to deterring human nature (survival, power-seeking). Recall that the bush admin started this war, for it's own reasons. Only afghanistan was retaliation for 9/11, and it was quite a different kind of war, as we all know. Had the neocons not driven us to war, we probably wouldn't have this doom and gloom discussion. Either way, disbanding the military I don't see as the answer. NOT going to war with no reason..hey, that sounds like a better idea -Mach","georged","101010","I think we're attempting to close the door after the horse is gone. N. Korea, Pakistan, India and Israel, not what one would call stable nations and certainly possessing emotional capability of using them if backed into a corner, all have active nuclear capability. Where dozens and dozens of admittedly missing former USSR nuclear weapons reside, some compact in size, is anyone's guess. Throughout history weapons development has always been a race to achieve an 'edge' over one's potential competition or at least parity. Sooner or later a tribe/nation feels aggressive or threatened and the long bow or a nuke is employed for whatever rationalization happens to be usable. As long as we have nuclear delivery ability to flatten whomever decides to take us on is about as good as it can get. Aside from 9/11, more an emotional event than widespread loss of life, and scattered, ineffective psychological coastal attacks during WW2, the US mainland has never suffered war by invasion. Considering our geographical isolation, any future invasion possibility is nil due to our having the nuclear means to deter an invasion force long before it became a danger. I don't advocate disbanding the military, just resizing it into a defense mechanism that complements our nuclear capability. Conventional ground forces are fine for putting out fires, but with nukes being the 'big gun' there won't be any need for immediate occupation forces if a situation develops where nukes are used. That can be accomplished after the fact with conscription. Besides, we haven't truly won a conventional ground war since WW2.","disbanding-military","09:04 AM","government-debates","32"

So far our military interventionism in order to stop the proliferation of nukes does not seem to be sucessful. Since smaller nations seem to understand that they only real hope they have regarding staving off an agressive Aemrica is the ability to nuke our troops, these ""rogue"" nationa are being pushed to develop the weapons at an accelerated rate.","disbanding-military","04:15 PM","government-debates","33"
"03-24-2005","4606",3,"None","None","None","StrategosFF","101128","I know I started the thread, but I didn't mean intially that we should just abandon the whole military, its just the US military as it stands now is like a money drain, we throw money into it so it can remain ""effective"" and every once in a while we want to know. ""Hey, are we getting our money's worth?"" I believe too that this nation might be better off with a mainly defensive military/militia. There will still be active duty components for jobs that require personnel who aren't ""weekend warriors"" such as pilots, we would still need a Navy, but not one that can ""project power anywhere in the world"". Also, I think the government needs restructuring too. There needs to be a limit placed on the government, that, they cannot declare war overseas on another country, without some sort of referandum from ""the people"". But none of this can/will happen, unless the American people change, and there's quite a bit of change required. Those are my thoughts.","disbanding-military","05:04 PM","government-debates","34"

In times of dire need, you can easily scrape together enough man-power to project the same leve of military might as you do today. However, politicians will be extreamly wary of sending off drafted youngsters to their deaths. Only the most dangerous and threatening of situations will warrant the kind of political damage a president would experience for sending away the sons and daughters of non-military families. Well, that my oppinion at least, or advice if you will.","disbanding-military","06:38 PM","government-debates","35"

However, running one's military spending, interest on past and current expenses, up to the major share of national budget and engaging in politically driven aggression for more of that budget in the form of public debt creates a riding the tiger situation where getting off means being eaten. Russia experienced disaster 15-years ago with this very scenario, but they've had natural resources and a very hungry public to assist them in climbing back. Our leadership is apparently relying on their Christian God to swoop down with a big bag of gold for purposes of fiscal recovery as our tax base continues its descent.","disbanding-military","07:50 PM","government-debates","36"
