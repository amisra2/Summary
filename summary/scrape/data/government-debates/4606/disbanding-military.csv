If you have a point to make, wouldn't it be nice if you told us why a standing military infringes on the liberties of citizens? Perhaps you are unaware of the custom of pre-revolutionary time wherein the British Army took over private property for their quarters. Thus the aversion to ""standing armies."" The founding fathers didn't forsee vast military reservations across the country where troops would be ""quartered"" without infringing on the rights of citizens. Your interpretation was tried twice. Once during WWI, when we were unprepared for a war and had to train troops quick time. Again for WWII we had no military to speak of. Again we were required to initiate a program of massive induction and training while our regular forces were being decimated. And after a few weeks of training, the conscripts were thrown into battle only to serve as cannon fodder. Let me give you a few facts. Army Reserve and National Guard units suffer more casualties in combat than do regular Army units. The reasons are not that hard to understand. The job of the regular (standing) Army is to be combat ready. Their daily job is to train for combat. Even when they are not in the field, they maintain equipment (critical learning), and attend training on a daily basis. When I was a member of our ""standing Army"" I spent a whole year ""in the field"" with only a 2 week leave. Our standing armies are no longer quartered in private homes. Never once was I quartered in anything other than military quarters while I was in the military. I think that the founding fathers didn't forsee Kaiser Wilhelm II, Hitler, or the Emperor of Japan. They caught us inadequately prepared because we had virtually no standing army. I'm sure that you do understand that the issue of a standing army and infringement are separate issues from the draft. Can you spell Pear Harbor? I knew you could.","disbanding-military","02:59 AM","government-debates","7"

Even without Bush as our president, we were still trying to influence the policies of FOREIGN SOVERIGN nations. A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive will not long be safe companions to liberty. The means of defence agst. foreign danger, have been always the instruments of tyranny at home. Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war, whenever a revolt was apprehended. Throughout all Europe, the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people.","daewoo","100032","And the $64 million question is, would we have done the same thing if we did not have a massive, standing, offensive military? We were warned about standing armies by those who founded the country. There are those who would argue thatt he world has changed, that their aversion to a standing army is outdated or no longer practical. Those who would argue this are XXXXXX. These were guyw who were subjects of the BRITISH EMPIRE. They lived during the NAPOLEONIC ERA. They were people who understood more about things like imperialism and projection of force and using your military as a trade negotiation tool than I daresay any handful of men currently alive. THEY LIVED IT. Those who founded this nation also understood another simple truth. England, which had not really been properly invaded since the romans (and even the mighty romans did not manage to take the entire island), derived most of its protection NOT from an army, but from the 10 miles of water between it and Europe. The US, with hundreds of miles of water on each side, has MUCH greater protection. Since the inception of America, only one really serious attempt has been made at widescale invasion, and that was in 1812. We all remember how that went. Those who lived during the napoleonic era, and saw british imperialism/colonialism first had also undrstood that in order to defeat your enemy, it was not enough to simply put your troops in their country, you have to completely control that country, bend the population to your will, defeat every individual who would raise arms against you, and then rebuild the nation in your own image (too bad Bush didn't think of this when invading Iraq). They understood that the US was so big that it would take a larger force than could ever concievably be mustered to fully occupy it, and that any force that DID attempt to occupy would be fighting an incredibly expensive war, hundreds of miles from home, which implies hundreds of miles from reinforcements or reliable resupply. Such an effort cannot possibly last long. It couldn't then, and it could not today. Keeping a large standing army is a quick road to a horrid foreign policy. Give the government a military to play with and you end up with a foreign policy that is whimsical, murderous, and it benefits us not one bit as citizens. By moving our defense from a militia type force as was originally intended to a professional force, all we have really done is removed a burden from our politicians. They no longer have to ask permission to kill people. Do you really think that, when the time came, our government would have been able to convince Americans to drop what they were doing and bop on over to Kosovo? Hell no, there simply would not be enough Americans who care about the Caspian pipeline to put thier own butts on the line. When we send our professional army, though, we say to ourselves ""thats what their paid for"". We view them as mercenaries, no more, no less. Consider the words of Madison: I know that there are whose who will argue that a militia is a poor defense force. Before you do, I would ask you to take a hard look at Switzerland, becuase they practice exactly the kind of defense that our founders envisioned. Switzerland shares borders with Germany, France, Lichtenstein, Austria, and Italy. All these nations have at one time or another been a major military power (yes, even lichtenstein). switzerland has not been in a declared war for over 800 years. Hitlers military advisors could not talk him out of invading Russia with winter coming on, but even he did not dare invade switzerland. When invading Switzerland was suggested to Mussolini, he said ""Every soldier we sent across the border would fall before reaching the first town"".","disbanding-military","03:12 AM","government-debates","8"

I am fairly certain most of them, and likely all of them, are now dead. I am unaware of anybody who is still alive from the napoleonic era. Sorry if that was unclear. Of course. Just a quick thought here. Maybe using two wars that we won isn't the best way to get your point across. In both WWI and WWII, germany had basically whipped all of europe, despite the fact that they had standing armies in every country but switzerland. The US, with basically no standing army in WWI, and fighting hundreds of miles from our own country, still won. At the start of WWII, the US had the second largest military on the planet. Only Germany had a larger military than the US. Franklin Roosevelt was the first person (as far as I can ascertain) to really bring the ""projection of force"" mentality to the forefront. He did so as secretary of the navy under Wilson. We had a larger army than Japan going into WWII. The apparent ""shortage"" in the armed forces was not due so much to us not having a sufficient army for any particular threat (since under roosevelt the Navy was heavily built up as well as a long-range strategic air force), but the fact that Germany had the largest army in the world, and japan was number 3, and we had to split our forces between 2 fronts. The tactics we were froced to employ in the pacific also bear consideration, since as we did our ""island hopping routine, we had to leave detachments on every strategically important island that we took long after we had moved on in order to assure that the japanese did not manage to get around our forces ad re-take them. this was very manpower intensive.","disbanding-military","04:41 AM","government-debates","10"

My argument on this is largely historically based. Those who founded this country (I will once again point out for the sake of clarity that I was NOT one of them) were well acquanted with the theory of imperialistic expansion and projection of force. They lived it. In considering the pros and cons, none of them seemed to have any doubt that it was a rather poor way to do business. Now, we are a declining empire. We have used our military force to project our will over much of the world, and we are starting to have to pay a price for it, just like the british did. This is EXACTLY what we were warned about. I think that it goes one step further than that. The Germans pinned their entire economy on thier war machine. With military failure came subseqyent economic collapse. The russians did the same. Our second best defense (right behind the fact that we are virtually inaccessible for invasion), has been our industrial infrastructure. In both WWI and WWII, our industrial output gave us a decided advantage over our adversaries. Today, I am not sure that advantage still exists. Look at the war in Iraq. Despite the calls for increased production of armored hummers, we simply cannot get them produced ina din the field. :emergency"" orders for armored vehicles and armor retrofit kits went out over a year ago, and they still have not been filled. We simply do not have the industrial capacity for production of wartime goods, even when it is just a piddly little war. In our excitement over providing for the ""defense"" of the nation (which somehow involves building a huge, offensive military), it seems we have scrapped the one item that has actually proved to be of defensive value to the nation, which is our industrial capability. If we fought WWII today, I think it is almost cerain we would loose. We just don't have the industrial capabluity to switch to war time production and provide materials and equipment to fight a major war. Also, our ""defensive capability"" is carefully calculated. The strengh of our military is theroetically designed to be able to defeat the next 5 most powerful miitaries on the planet on their home turf.

Kabul is now safe and under ""our"" control.....during the day. In Iraq, on the other hand, we have done much better. We retain partial control of several major cities. We have even instituted free elections. Of course, it appears that chalibi is the front runner from prime minister (remember, the guys who faulty intelligence led us into Iraq, and who we later discoverd was an Iranian spy). The new government will apparently feature autonomous Kurds using northern Iraq as a staging area for a partial invasion of turkey, and the rest of Iraq being closely alinged with Iran, who is probably our biggest enemy in the region. Maybe the lesson has been lost on the US public, but otehrs around the world were paying attention. Our military is maxed out following the invasion of Iraq, a nation with 30 year old equipment, no strategic weapons, no allies, and a conscript army.

Which begs the question ""why do we feel compelled to take offensive action""? Having seen peacekeeping missions first hand, nad over the sights of a rifle, let me be the first to clue you into a fact that should be apparent by now. THEY DO NOT WORK. Throughout history mankind has decided control issues based not on diplomacy, but on violence. Buy intervening in this process in other nations, we effectively ensure that weak, oftne unpopular governments maintain control. While this is certianly an ideal policy from our standpoint since it ensures that third tier nations maintain their place and do not start jockying for position, it is not good for the nations where we intervene, or at least not for the peope of that nation.","Mach","100316","But it's not a game you play and lose, then go, man, we should have played harder. It's the single game that you do not lose because of lack of effort, and there is very little justification for not spending enormous amounts of resources on making sure it never becomes a problem. How do we know what impact our military has had on our, and much of the world's, safety? I don't think that's something you can test after the fact. WWII wasn't long ago. Historically speaking, great civilizations have existed far longer than our current dominion, only to fall prey to other civilizations who didn't hesitate to pounce when they saw an opening. Why would this change? Until we genetically engineer ourselves to be less survival-driven, I don't see how this fundamental issue will go away. Regarding lunacy and bad spending, agreed. That's easily solved but hard to implement. I mean, 1/2 our GDP and no bullet proof vests...the evidence abounds. Negative reinforcement. Real-world test of our military machine.

"03-23-2005","4606",2,"daewoo","None","What this boils down to is whether you want an offensive military or a defensive one. While I would certainly agree that it is best to err on the side of caution when calculating the defensive needs of your country, our modern military is not a defensive one, nor is particularly well suited for defense. It is a wholly offensive military. This is a fundamental decision that must be made. Do we send our military all over the world seeking to maintain the staus quo, or do we allow the rest of the world to profress socially in a natural manner? Maybe you could name a couple of them for me. Very few civilizations fall to wholly external pressure, in fact, external pressures are seldom even a major driving force behind the fall of a great civilization. When one considers the advantage that the geography of the US gives us (namely isolation from any potential agressors), the number of forces required to ""secure the empire"" are miniscule. If we would quite using our military as a barganing chip in trade negotitation, and making enemies all over the world, that number could be reduced even more. the first is a non issue if you are maintaining a defensive military. Nobody invades another nation without considering the costs involved, and the costs involved in an invasion of the continental united states is simply too high. History also shows that the surest way for an empire to fall is to start down a road of military conquest. While you may win every battle, in the long run you still loose the war. In the end, your enemies unite against you militarily, and the defense of far flung posessions becomes so expansive that no economy can keep up.","Mach","100949","That sounds like a different debate. You are supporting NOT disbanding the military, only changing it's function (And composition/training, etc.) The new question is, what advantages do we enjoy having an offensive army (vs a much more defensive one). Yes, that's a fundamental question. Here is your test, it's really the only one you need to pass. Rogue nations develop nuclear weapons and delivery systems. They could use them (on us or anyone, either) They could lose them (to terrorists, to other countries, to individuals) What are you doing to stop this? Send in the militia?

While this woudl certainly mean disbanding large parts fo the military, I woudl certainly adovcate leaving a defensive force intact. Well, lets compare the sucess we had in regards to north korea with the sucess the Europeans have had with the iranians. We fought nuclear production in N korea for years, and now they have the bomb. The europeans have been talking to the IRanians fro a couple of years now, an the iranians have agreed not to build the bomb. When you take a military hardline against nations, you force them into a defensive position. When it is the US doing the forcing, they really have no choice but to try to develop nukes, since conventional forces have no chance against our massive miklitary machine. Frankly, since the stated policy of the US as far as nuclear weapons is concerend is one of like force (i.e you use nukes, we will too), the sugegstion that rogue nations are going to be running around nuking people is simply foolish. You really think N korae is going to do a first strike using a nuke when they know full well that the second strike in the engagement will be a half dozen titan 4 missiles, each with 10- 100 kt warheads coming screeching out of the sky to wipe their entire country off the map? What we are trying to do regarding nuclear weapons is put the genie back in the bottle. It simply doesn't work. Fortunatly, nuclear weapons are the most devetatingly worthless devices on the planet, unless you are the ONLY one who has them. No nation is foolish enough to use one, since it would unquestionably be the end of their nation. But, our offensive military keeps loosing wars. Fighting wars overseas, besides being obscenely expensive, doesn't seem to do much for you besides garner ill will. Economic incentives have proven MUCH more effective than military intervention. so, lets change it from wholly external pressures to ""primarily external pressures"". Empires fall due to mismanagement. End of story. He also didn't try to invade the united states. He had some planes flown into the towers. Our massive military couldn't do a damn thing to stop that, and still can't. That is one of the costs of being the bully onthe block. Occasionally somebody will stand up to you and bloody your nose. The real ""value"" of BLs ""accomplishment"", besides the trillions that he cost us, is the fatc that he showed tghat it CAN BE DONE. You CAN hit america and get away with it and livew to fight another day, because for all our power, and all our money, and all our military, we still can't find a 6' tall arab in pakistan with a dialysis machine. He has one of the best known faces in the arab world (and did before the attacks), and in spite of a massive bounty on his head, we can't get anybody to turn him in. Sure it is. Whether you actually annex the smaller nation and make it the 51st state, or just install a puppet government and run it remotely, it is the same thing. You are still maintaining control. From a practical standpoint, installing a puppet government is a more complete conquest than simple annexation. If you annex them, your peopel have rights, you are bound by the laws of the united states. If you just install a puppet government and rule by proxy, there are no ""rights"" for the people. Instead of having to deal with minimum wage laws, federal workplace standards, etc....US corporations are more than welcome to open sweat shops and employ children to do dangerous jobs for pennies per hour. ============= Yes, all over the world we have ensured that weak and tyrannical governments have stayed in power, thus ensuring that places like S America and Africa will always remain in their place.......a supplier of cheap natural resources and a possible future location for a Nike sweat shop. OR, works to create threats proactively. HAve you not noticed how many nations are now developing nuclear weapons in response to our recent agression?

Korea, Pakistan, India and Israel, not what one would call stable nations and certainly possessing emotional capability of using them if backed into a corner, all have active nuclear capability. Where dozens and dozens of admittedly missing former USSR nuclear weapons reside, some compact in size, is anyone's guess. Throughout history weapons development has always been a race to achieve an 'edge' over one's potential competition or at least parity. Sooner or later a tribe/nation feels aggressive or threatened and the long bow or a nuke is employed for whatever rationalization happens to be usable. As long as we have nuclear delivery ability to flatten whomever decides to take us on is about as good as it can get. Aside from 9/11, more an emotional event than widespread loss of life, and scattered, ineffective psychological coastal attacks during WW2, the US mainland has never suffered war by invasion. Considering our geographical isolation, any future invasion possibility is nil due to our having the nuclear means to deter an invasion force long before it became a danger. I don't advocate disbanding the military, just resizing it into a defense mechanism that complements our nuclear capability. Conventional ground forces are fine for putting out fires, but with nukes being the 'big gun' there won't be any need for immediate occupation forces if a situation develops where nukes are used. That can be accomplished after the fact with conscription. Besides, we haven't truly won a conventional ground war since WW2.","disbanding-military","09:04 AM","government-debates","32"

Also, I think the government needs restructuring too.
