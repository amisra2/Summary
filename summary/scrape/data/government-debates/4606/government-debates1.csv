If you have a point to make, wouldn't it be nice if you told us why a standing military infringes on the liberties of citizens? Perhaps you are unaware of the custom of pre-revolutionary time wherein the British Army took over private property for their quarters. Thus the aversion to ""standing armies."" The founding fathers didn't forsee vast military reservations across the country where troops would be ""quartered"" without infringing on the rights of citizens. Your interpretation was tried twice. Once during WWI, when we were unprepared for a war and had to train troops quick time. Again for WWII we had no military to speak of. Again we were required to initiate a program of massive induction and training while our regular forces were being decimated. And after a few weeks of training, the conscripts were thrown into battle only to serve as cannon fodder. Let me give you a few facts. Army Reserve and National Guard units suffer more casualties in combat than do regular Army units. The reasons are not that hard to understand. The job of the regular (standing) Army is to be combat ready. Their daily job is to train for combat. Even when they are not in the field, they maintain equipment (critical learning), and attend training on a daily basis. When I was a member of our ""standing Army"" I spent a whole year ""in the field"" with only a 2 week leave. Our standing armies are no longer quartered in private homes. Never once was I quartered in anything other than military quarters while I was in the military. I think that the founding fathers didn't forsee Kaiser Wilhelm II, Hitler, or the Emperor of Japan. They caught us inadequately prepared because we had virtually no standing army. I'm sure that you do understand that the issue of a standing army and infringement are separate issues from the draft. Can you spell Pear Harbor? I knew you could.","disbanding-military","02:59 AM","government-debates","7"
"03-21-2005","4606",1,"StrategosFF","None","Bush has been our president for like 5 years...we've been dealing with terrorist threats for how long? Even without Bush as our president, we were still trying to influence the policies of FOREIGN SOVERIGN nations. A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive will not long be safe companions to liberty. The means of defence agst. foreign danger, have been always the instruments of tyranny at home. Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war, whenever a revolt was apprehended. Throughout all Europe, the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people.","daewoo","100032","And the $64 million question is, would we have done the same thing if we did not have a massive, standing, offensive military? We were warned about standing armies by those who founded the country. There are those who would argue thatt he world has changed, that their aversion to a standing army is outdated or no longer practical. Those who would argue this are XXXXXX. These were guyw who were subjects of the BRITISH EMPIRE. They lived during the NAPOLEONIC ERA. They were people who understood more about things like imperialism and projection of force and using your military as a trade negotiation tool than I daresay any handful of men currently alive. THEY LIVED IT. Those who founded this nation also understood another simple truth. England, which had not really been properly invaded since the romans (and even the mighty romans did not manage to take the entire island), derived most of its protection NOT from an army, but from the 10 miles of water between it and Europe. The US, with hundreds of miles of water on each side, has MUCH greater protection. Since the inception of America, only one really serious attempt has been made at widescale invasion, and that was in 1812. We all remember how that went. Those who lived during the napoleonic era, and saw british imperialism/colonialism first had also undrstood that in order to defeat your enemy, it was not enough to simply put your troops in their country, you have to completely control that country, bend the population to your will, defeat every individual who would raise arms against you, and then rebuild the nation in your own image (too bad Bush didn't think of this when invading Iraq). They understood that the US was so big that it would take a larger force than could ever concievably be mustered to fully occupy it, and that any force that DID attempt to occupy would be fighting an incredibly expensive war, hundreds of miles from home, which implies hundreds of miles from reinforcements or reliable resupply. Such an effort cannot possibly last long. It couldn't then, and it could not today. Keeping a large standing army is a quick road to a horrid foreign policy. Give the government a military to play with and you end up with a foreign policy that is whimsical, murderous, and it benefits us not one bit as citizens. By moving our defense from a militia type force as was originally intended to a professional force, all we have really done is removed a burden from our politicians. They no longer have to ask permission to kill people. Do you really think that, when the time came, our government would have been able to convince Americans to drop what they were doing and bop on over to Kosovo? Hell no, there simply would not be enough Americans who care about the Caspian pipeline to put thier own butts on the line. When we send our professional army, though, we say to ourselves ""thats what their paid for"". We view them as mercenaries, no more, no less. Consider the words of Madison: I know that there are whose who will argue that a militia is a poor defense force. Before you do, I would ask you to take a hard look at Switzerland, becuase they practice exactly the kind of defense that our founders envisioned. Switzerland shares borders with Germany, France, Lichtenstein, Austria, and Italy. All these nations have at one time or another been a major military power (yes, even lichtenstein). switzerland has not been in a declared war for over 800 years. Hitlers military advisors could not talk him out of invading Russia with winter coming on, but even he did not dare invade switzerland. When invading Switzerland was suggested to Mussolini, he said ""Every soldier we sent across the border would fall before reaching the first town"".","disbanding-military","03:12 AM","government-debates","8"

I am fairly certain most of them, and likely all of them, are now dead. I am unaware of anybody who is still alive from the napoleonic era. Sorry if that was unclear. Of course. Just a quick thought here. Maybe using two wars that we won isn't the best way to get your point across. In both WWI and WWII, germany had basically whipped all of europe, despite the fact that they had standing armies in every country but switzerland. The US, with basically no standing army in WWI, and fighting hundreds of miles from our own country, still won. At the start of WWII, the US had the second largest military on the planet. Only Germany had a larger military than the US. Franklin Roosevelt was the first person (as far as I can ascertain) to really bring the ""projection of force"" mentality to the forefront. He did so as secretary of the navy under Wilson. We had a larger army than Japan going into WWII. The apparent ""shortage"" in the armed forces was not due so much to us not having a sufficient army for any particular threat (since under roosevelt the Navy was heavily built up as well as a long-range strategic air force), but the fact that Germany had the largest army in the world, and japan was number 3, and we had to split our forces between 2 fronts. The tactics we were froced to employ in the pacific also bear consideration, since as we did our ""island hopping routine, we had to leave detachments on every strategically important island that we took long after we had moved on in order to assure that the japanese did not manage to get around our forces ad re-take them. this was very manpower intensive.","disbanding-military","04:41 AM","government-debates","10"

My argument on this is largely historically based. Those who founded this country (I will once again point out for the sake of clarity that I was NOT one of them) were well acquanted with the theory of imperialistic expansion and projection of force. They lived it. In considering the pros and cons, none of them seemed to have any doubt that it was a rather poor way to do business. Now, we are a declining empire. We have used our military force to project our will over much of the world, and we are starting to have to pay a price for it, just like the british did. This is EXACTLY what we were warned about. I think that it goes one step further than that. The Germans pinned their entire economy on thier war machine. With military failure came subseqyent economic collapse. The russians did the same. Our second best defense (right behind the fact that we are virtually inaccessible for invasion), has been our industrial infrastructure. In both WWI and WWII, our industrial output gave us a decided advantage over our adversaries. Today, I am not sure that advantage still exists. Look at the war in Iraq. Despite the calls for increased production of armored hummers, we simply cannot get them produced ina din the field. :emergency"" orders for armored vehicles and armor retrofit kits went out over a year ago, and they still have not been filled. We simply do not have the industrial capacity for production of wartime goods, even when it is just a piddly little war. In our excitement over providing for the ""defense"" of the nation (which somehow involves building a huge, offensive military), it seems we have scrapped the one item that has actually proved to be of defensive value to the nation, which is our industrial capability. If we fought WWII today, I think it is almost cerain we would loose. We just don't have the industrial capabluity to switch to war time production and provide materials and equipment to fight a major war. Also, our ""defensive capability"" is carefully calculated. The strengh of our military is theroetically designed to be able to defeat the next 5 most powerful miitaries on the planet on their home turf. Can somebody please explain the mental gymnastics necessary to transform defeating the next 5 most powerful militaries on the planet on their home turf in such a manner to reconcile it with any currently known and accepted definition of the word ""defense""?","disbanding-military","04:41 PM","government-debates","15"
