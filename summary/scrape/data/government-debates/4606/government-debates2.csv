The strengh of our military is theroetically designed to be able to defeat the next 5 most powerful miitaries on the planet on their home turf. Can somebody please explain the mental gymnastics necessary to transform defeating the next 5 most powerful militaries on the planet on their home turf in such a manner to reconcile it with any currently known and accepted definition of the word ""defense""?","georged","100254","I guess we should ignore Afghanistan and Iraq when calculating that ability? Our government has declared victory and our ground forces are stretched to declining reenlistments. I'm just a pretty basic businessman and fail to understand these so-called military theories. The way I see it, a country attacks us, we nuke them. That capability shouldn't require 50% of our annual budget and qualifies as defense. Our spreading democracy at the point of a gun doesn't constitute defense unless we've adopted paranoia as a national state of mind and seek our own destruction.","disbanding-military","06:52 PM","government-debates","16"

YES, the US military is designed to take on the next 5 largest militaries (or most effective militaries) and win decisively. On the other hand, in Afghanistan and Iraq, after spending hundreds of billions and stretching our military tot eh breaking point, we have reached a pinacle. Kabul is now safe and under ""our"" control.....during the day. In Iraq, on the other hand, we have done much better. We retain partial control of several major cities. We have even instituted free elections. Of course, it appears that chalibi is the front runner from prime minister (remember, the guys who faulty intelligence led us into Iraq, and who we later discoverd was an Iranian spy). The new government will apparently feature autonomous Kurds using northern Iraq as a staging area for a partial invasion of turkey, and the rest of Iraq being closely alinged with Iran, who is probably our biggest enemy in the region. Maybe the lesson has been lost on the US public, but otehrs around the world were paying attention. Our military is maxed out following the invasion of Iraq, a nation with 30 year old equipment, no strategic weapons, no allies, and a conscript army. Nations like Syria, Iran, and N Korea, who have better equipment, volunteer soldiers, and allies have got to be sitting there going ""why have we been afraid of these bafoons for all these years""?","disbanding-military","07:22 PM","government-debates","17"

"03-21-2005","4606",2,"daewoo","None","I think you would have a diffult time showing any military contribution to our overall safety since WWII. Most of our military actions have been eiether profit driven or driven by idealogical lunacy. the last time the US faced anything resembeling risk of soveirgnty, it was from the mexicans. Which begs the question ""why do we feel compelled to take offensive action""? Having seen peacekeeping missions first hand, nad over the sights of a rifle, let me be the first to clue you into a fact that should be apparent by now. THEY DO NOT WORK. Throughout history mankind has decided control issues based not on diplomacy, but on violence. Buy intervening in this process in other nations, we effectively ensure that weak, oftne unpopular governments maintain control. While this is certianly an ideal policy from our standpoint since it ensures that third tier nations maintain their place and do not start jockying for position, it is not good for the nations where we intervene, or at least not for the peope of that nation.","Mach","100316","But it's not a game you play and lose, then go, man, we should have played harder. It's the single game that you do not lose because of lack of effort, and there is very little justification for not spending enormous amounts of resources on making sure it never becomes a problem. How do we know what impact our military has had on our, and much of the world's, safety? I don't think that's something you can test after the fact. WWII wasn't long ago. Historically speaking, great civilizations have existed far longer than our current dominion, only to fall prey to other civilizations who didn't hesitate to pounce when they saw an opening. Why would this change? Until we genetically engineer ourselves to be less survival-driven, I don't see how this fundamental issue will go away. Regarding lunacy and bad spending, agreed. That's easily solved but hard to implement. I mean, 1/2 our GDP and no bullet proof vests...the evidence abounds. Negative reinforcement. Real-world test of our military machine. Drum up public approval of military spending(?). But I'm not under the delusion that our missions are designed to either #1 bring about peace in the region #2 benefit those we are ""helping"". Our own interests must be, and should continue to be, the driving force behind our foreign policy. At least from an ""old guard"" perspective. The economic turf seems to be an equally valid ""battleground"" now, one we are not so sure-footed on. I'm playing necon devil's advocate here if you haven't noticed. Although despite my gut feel that this position isn't long-term the most healthy, I have a hard time arguing against it because it rests on historical certainty, that survival means violence, and conquest. We have a choice. Ensure our way of life by any and all means at our disposal vs. leaving ourselves open for conquest. Economics are important, but we can nuke (or through conventional war) countries back to the stone age, their money is meaningless without a government to back it. -Mach","disbanding-military","10:42 PM","government-debates","19"

We backed the people who made those countries into what they were before we went in and ""fixed things"". Yes, a great wrong was set right, and people are free, but they were enslaved by our involvment and now they've had freedom forced upon them by our influence as well.","disbanding-military","11:04 PM","government-debates","20"

Do we decline gracefully and attempt to solidify our military position and reduce those costs by eventual alignment with EU to repair our internal damage (live to fight another day) or tear the world apart in an attempt to spread a not-so-perfect ideology at the cost of our remaining wealth and taking the world including ourselves back to the stone age?

"03-23-2005","4606",2,"daewoo","None","History also shows that the surest way for an empire to fall is to start down a road of military conquest. While you may win every battle, in the long run you still loose the war. In the end, your enemies unite against you militarily, and the defense of far flung posessions becomes so expansive that no economy can keep up.","georged","100787","The Romans discovered that when repeated drought created crop failures in conquered lands, tax revenues from those lands dwindled, Rome couldn't pay the army (Roman occupation forces collected all tax revenue, kept their share and forwarded the remainder to to Rome) and the army vanished into that countryside not coveted by Germanic tribes leaving Rome itself defenseless. The US, with seemingly unlimited national wealth and military capability of forcefully occupying every nation not immediately showering us with flowers in their eagerness to accept Western democracy will be immune to such circumstances, because our leadership tells us we will be triumphant in spreading democracy at any cost because the Christian God is on our side.

"03-23-2005","4606",2,"daewoo","None","What this boils down to is whether you want an offensive military or a defensive one. While I would certainly agree that it is best to err on the side of caution when calculating the defensive needs of your country, our modern military is not a defensive one, nor is particularly well suited for defense. It is a wholly offensive military. This is a fundamental decision that must be made. Do we send our military all over the world seeking to maintain the staus quo, or do we allow the rest of the world to profress socially in a natural manner? Maybe you could name a couple of them for me. Very few civilizations fall to wholly external pressure, in fact, external pressures are seldom even a major driving force behind the fall of a great civilization. When one considers the advantage that the geography of the US gives us (namely isolation from any potential agressors), the number of forces required to ""secure the empire"" are miniscule. If we would quite using our military as a barganing chip in trade negotitation, and making enemies all over the world, that number could be reduced even more. the first is a non issue if you are maintaining a defensive military. Nobody invades another nation without considering the costs involved, and the costs involved in an invasion of the continental united states is simply too high. History also shows that the surest way for an empire to fall is to start down a road of military conquest. While you may win every battle, in the long run you still loose the war. In the end, your enemies unite against you militarily, and the defense of far flung posessions becomes so expansive that no economy can keep up.","Mach","100949","That sounds like a different debate. You are supporting NOT disbanding the military, only changing it's function (And composition/training, etc.) The new question is, what advantages do we enjoy having an offensive army (vs a much more defensive one). Yes, that's a fundamental question. Here is your test, it's really the only one you need to pass. Rogue nations develop nuclear weapons and delivery systems. They could use them (on us or anyone, either) They could lose them (to terrorists, to other countries, to individuals) What are you doing to stop this? Send in the militia? The U.S. doesn't sit on it's hands and watch our enemies grow, arm, and attack. Rather, we make sure we stop it before it starts. It's either passive, or active. We choose in active role in our nation's security. For that reason alone, an offensive military, that gets used, is required. I never claimed wholly, and didn't imply it. Being corrupt AND having no military is still worse than being corrupt and HAVING a large military, in terms of vulnerability. Every nation that has ever been taken over after having been beaten in war, or without being able to defend itself. Costs? Why did Osama crash the towers? For money? Aha, money isn't the only driving force for human-kind...how novel. But we aren't going for conquest, whent's the last time we added land to the U.S. through warfare? Are we posturing for that? Enforcing our will on other countries with our military is not the same as conquest. ============= Lastly, with MANY countries, the U.S. makes agreements that place the U.S. firmly in the role of ""security provider"". We own the military for many countries, almost literally. To dismantle that would dismantle a lot more than just ""our own security"", it would unravel the security of the world....and the vaccuum would be filled. Your choice is this. A known good - America has the biggest and baddest military, works to reduce threats to the U.S. and our allies, proactively. An unknown - disband our military and watch what happens. -Mach","disbanding-military","09:36 PM","government-debates","29"

Stop nuclear proliferation because we don't trust anyone else with them. The only way to do this is through enforcement. The alternative...non-enforcement, simply isn't a rational approach to deterring human nature (survival, power-seeking). Recall that the bush admin started this war, for it's own reasons. Only afghanistan was retaliation for 9/11, and it was quite a different kind of war, as we all know. Had the neocons not driven us to war, we probably wouldn't have this doom and gloom discussion. Either way, disbanding the military I don't see as the answer. NOT going to war with no reason..hey, that sounds like a better idea -Mach","disbanding-military","09:42 PM","government-debates","30"
