As a result, they have to go to food pantries for handouts, and have to live on food stamps. Well, Bill Moyers just did a report on it on PBS, and it makes me sick. These people are defending our country, and our government won't pay them a decent wage. To top it all off, they interviewed Rep. Duncan Hunter, who said that the troops prefer it that way, that this country's military members would rather pull themselves up by their bootstraps than ask Uncle Sam for a raise. The same Duncan Hunter that still supports Star Wars and the Osprey aircraft, even though everyone else agrees these are obsolete, needless programs. He'd rather watch our fighting boys stand in line for food handouts than give them a decent salary. What an outrage- I truly feel sorry for anyone that lives in this idiot's district. He's the same kind of do-nothing congressman that would distract us from REAL issues like this, and worry about flag-burning, gay marriages and Star Wars defense tactics. How does this guy sleep at night? I'm pretty good at controlling my temper, but I can't even begin to tell you all how ****** I am at this jerk. He won't even vote for a pay raise for our fighting men and women. Truly a disgrace to all Americans, and this creep actually has an American flag on his website. Oh yeah, go check it out- what a laugh. I tried to e-mail him, but everything's set up so that you can only e-mail your own congressman. I guess he's got his hands full with his own upset constituents, he doesn't have time for me! If anyone here lives in the San Diego area, I'd certainly like to hear your opinion. Just how does the XXXXX Duncan continue to get re-elected?","worlds-biggest-moron-rep-duncan-hunter","10:14 PM","government-debates","1"

And I would say a lot of people still support ""Star Wars"" and many in the military still want the Osprey... ""Star Wars"" gave us those Patriot missile batteries and all the other missile defenses we'll see coming online in the next few years.","worlds-biggest-moron-rep-duncan-hunter","07:39 AM","government-debates","2"

What Bill Moyers showed was the pay of our soldiers vs. the cost of living in the San Diego area. The soldiers pay is just slightly more than half of basic living costs. They also showed dozens of our soldiers and their families standing in line at food banks, waiting for hand-outs. Probably just hired a bunch of actors for that, right? As for the ""honorable"" Congressman Hunter, Bill Moyers didn't say anything; it was the congressman himself that made the statements, on film. If Bill Moyers did something to put words in that XXXXX's mouth, then Moyers should go to jail. But I doubt even a wacko liberal like Moyers is THAT stupid. If anyone else thinks I (or Bill Moyers) is lying, then please get the transcript from PBS and prove me wrong. For the record, this isn't about being liberal or conservative, despite Broker's attempts to turn it that way. It's about our government paying our troops enough money that they can at least feed, clothe and house their families without ""relying on the kindness of strangers."" The troops won't complain about it themselves, because I'm sure they (and their commanding officers) are convinced it would show weakness on their part to do so. No matter how you try to spin this, it's still a disgrace. If they're willing to lay their lives on the line for our country, then the least our country can do is pay them a decent wage.","worlds-biggest-moron-rep-duncan-hunter","10:09 AM","government-debates","3"

The nice thing for you is that you don't have to join the military plotter, you can sit back and let other people go and sacrifice to ensure your safety... But on topic, I've always thought that the military needs to pay more. And Bill Moyers and Rush Limbaugh are both ridiculously slanted, you can't put much stock in either one of them.","worlds-biggest-moron-rep-duncan-hunter","01:55 AM","government-debates","6"

One merely raises the rate of pay and benefits well above that of the factory jobs that have disappeared. Those individuals who are not continuing their educations are then presented with the choice of low-paying service sector jobs with no benefits and seemingly total financial security with the option to obtain a college education at government expense.","worlds-biggest-moron-rep-duncan-hunter","08:31 AM","government-debates","10"

Then, like my comrades, I did my best, went where I was sent, did my duty, did my time and got out. If we are to maintain an all volunteer military, especially if it our intent to unilaterally invade other countries and build governments by force of arms, we had better pay our troops enough to keep them.
