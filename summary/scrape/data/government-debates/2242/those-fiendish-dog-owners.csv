I cannot find te article in the newspaper rchives now, but have kept a copy of it and would be happy to mail it out to anybody who wishes to confirm it. Apparently last friday, the police made an arrest at 3:00 in the morning. THey went to the guys house and knocked on the door. When he answered, they handcuffed him in his bath robe and took him down t the police station to process him. He had to post a $200 bond in order to be reeased from jail. His crime was that he was 45 days late in renewing his dog license. Apparently the city manager in ElDorado had compiled a list of people who were late on their dog permits and handed it over to the police department asking that they arrest a few folks in order to make an example. Now, to my mind, there are some things we arrest people for, and some things that we send them a strongly worded letter about, and in EXTREME cases, send them a summons (write a ticket). Failure to register your dog is not something you arrest people for. I think this is the kind of heavy handed law enforcement that leads to ryder trucks filled with fertilizer and fuel oil. What do you guys think? Is this a legitimate use of law enforcement personell? IS this a legitimate means of promoting a ""licence your dog"" campaign? I think my view is pretty clear. What do the rest of you think?","those-fiendish-dog-owners","12:39 PM","government-debates","1"

Infringing personal rights can lead towards a distrust in government but I really do hope that even the Patriot Act will be challenged by legal means. And even if someone wanted to rebel against such laws, Id highly recommend to target the administration rather than civilians. My opinion is that it is just ridiculous. But less alarming than the example you posted in the thread about ""high electric bill = terrorist"".","those-fiendish-dog-owners","01:07 PM","government-debates","2"

He apparently felt that in attacking the governemtn he was doing some good (maybe even believed it wuld start a revolution). We may all think he was nuts, but he wasn't just some wacko serial killer who killed for no reason. I think that **** like this encourages wackos like that, as well as the electrc bill thing, property forfeiture abuse, infringements on the second ammendment (There is a poll at RKBA.com that shows that 40 some percent of folks who took it seem to think that we need to resort to violence to put out government right, RKBA.com gats more trafic than the NRA site). I don;t think Mc Veigh was just looking for an excuse to kill a bunch of people, in his mind he was performing a counter attack, twisted as it may have been. I would hope so, too. IT is easier to kill a bunch of civilians, but doesn;t do a whole lot of good. I think history shows that the best way to defeat an army is to specificallly target either the leaders of the army or the political types behind them. Killing foot soldiers does little good. I think there is a real problem recently with militant types getting organised. There seem to be a lot of people in the US who are starting to see our government as an oppressive force that needs to be overthrown. I think there are enough of those folks out there to make a difference, and now they sem to be getting organised via the internet. I would agree that this pales in comparison. I just thought it was interesting/insane and thought I would see what others thought.","those-fiendish-dog-owners","02:16 PM","government-debates","3"

Maybe he just took the Turner Diaries a bit too personal. But I agree to your conclusion about the twisted motif. What are they fighting against? Im asking because in my imagination these are the same folks that favour the war against terrorism and dont protest against the President. They certainly distrust the FBI or the police and it is a really chilling thougt that some militias could plan their little revolution. But are they alarmed by things like the Patriot Act or the high spendings on the military, or more by hyped-up court decisions they hear on Fox or the drudge? After your second post I started to think over my first judgement.","those-fiendish-dog-owners","07:26 AM","government-debates","5"

I am not a revolutionary wacko (Ok, so I am, but I think that better results will come from sending money to canidates you like and working through the court systems to get what we want) I do know a couple of them, though. I have a firing range at my house w/ pop up targets that I let people (including the local PD) use, and there are a coupel of guys who come out that have that wild look in their eye and believe in a militant ideaology. THese are not the folks who support bush, nor are they the folks that favor the war on terrorism. They seem to be what I would term as ""true conservatives"". They are big fans of the constitution, including the parts about standing armies. They mostly seem to believe that we are fighting the war in Iraq for the sake of Israel, and that our ""war on terror"" is in large part just targeting the enemies of israel (with the exception of afghanistan, which we had to do because that is actuially where the terrorists were). The guys I know who are militant types seem to think that both political partis are corrupt, and America has sunkn to a point where e revolution is needed to get it back on course. The reason these guys are so scary is that they are SMART. McVeigh was an idiot, or they wouldn't have caught him. I think that if the individuals I personally know who are militants decided to pull off such an attack, they would most likely succeed without being caught in a vehicle full of incriminating evidence. One of these guys is a college professor, the other is a vice president at a major corporation. They have neat gadgets, like encrypted sat phones. I actually agree with their political idealogy on many points. I even believe that we need a revoltion to set America back on the right path, though I think the revolution needs to be a political one as opposed to a civil war. I think we need to hold our politicians accountable for their actions, and we need to wean them off the special interests teat. To my mind, the big question is whether we will be able to pull of a political revolution before the fringe groups get organised enough to start killing people. I read a deal a while back by by fema that said there were over 5,000,000 of these folks out there. 5 million isolated individuals, or isolated in groups of 100 or less are pretty harmless. 5 million individuals organised and working for a common goal are a force to be reckoned with, especially if they are willing to kill people to further their goals. Our military only has 2 million, and only a quarter of those are combat troops. I could be mistaken, but I don;t think there are even 5 million law enforcement officers in the US. An armed uprising by 5 million people could potentially be a disaster for this country.","those-fiendish-dog-owners","12:01 PM","government-debates","6"

Sending cops out at 3am to arrest folks for not tagging there dog give me a break what the heck is wrong with that the cops dont have any thing else to do such as keeping the streets safe at that hour gee there could be a rapist out there at that hour but insted they are going after dog owners .","those-fiendish-dog-owners","06:52 PM","government-debates","7"
"04-28-2004","2242",1,"None","None","None","jskufan","46577","Licensing dogs is just another way municipalities use to extort money from their residents. The city ""politicians"" get together, decide that charging residents $10, $15, $20, ??? annually to own their dogs would bring in a certain amount to the city. Their hopes are that since it's a small nominal amount of money, most people will just pay it without question. A tax increase is usually something that has to be voted on, ""****"" like this can be steamrolled through without citizen approval. The law enforcement in that town are probably elected officials, maybe the voters should be more selective with their votes!!","those-fiendish-dog-owners","06:20 PM","government-debates","8"
