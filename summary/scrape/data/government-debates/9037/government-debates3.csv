"10-21-2006","9037",3,"billsco","235789","Paper ballots of course leave a paper trail. It's the twists and turns of that trail that cause the degree of error. For instance, every election cycle it seems we get a news story about a guy who got pulled over for a burned out taillight and had twenty ballot boxes in the trunk. What is that about? Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago is widely believed to have delivered his city to John Kennedy in the '60 election by bogus ballots. My only point is that no system is fool-proof, and we shouldn't dismiss electronic methods out of hand.","Rovdak","235817","I agree to that, as long as there is a paper trail accompanying it","can-third-party-ever-make","07:07 AM","government-debates","32"

Invalidate all of them? Do a revote? Remember election day is one day planned forever, and there are always small errors (hence recount laws). What happens when the count is off by 5? 10? 100? What if the count is off by enough to swing the election?","can-third-party-ever-make","10:52 PM","government-debates","33"

Ross Perot went as far as anybody , might have done it too had he not wigged out like a nut at the end.

I am a conservative and I predicted the Democrats would win Congress. If the war in Iraq is still going in 2008, they will win the White House too. Democrats didn't really win the House so much as Republicans lost it. The Republicans have drifted so far from their original intent which won them the House in the first place. Perhaps this is the fate of any party that gets power? Maybe in another 10-12 years the Democrats will all be corrupt, power-abusing XXXXXX and America will turn to the Republicans again. How long will this cycle last before another leader emerges in the form of a new party?","can-third-party-ever-make","09:53 AM","government-debates","36"

Now we as citizens can get to know our representatives. There local offices are open to the citizens . Walk right in get to know a aid and leave them personal letters from time to time. Demanding we get change in the goverment. If we do that as a nation in the numbers that voted agsint Bush in this election we can force change . A national petition to enact term limits can be forced to be posted in each politicians local office , as well as in public places all over the nation. The key is 60 million plus voted in this election , many more will begin to vote if they feel thier vote can bring change. Its important to not let it be business as usual , but to show them we are tired of the corruption and money grubbing in Washington and our state houses and we the citizens are paying attention , and we will continue to pay attention till they act to change things. I am working on a document for petition of my local congressmen and Senator now. I suggest everybody do the same and when it catch's on somebody smarter than me can take it national and maybe we can throw the lobbists out of the goverment.","can-third-party-ever-make","12:54 PM","government-debates","37"

What office was he running for? Now you're talking. The key is 60 million plus voted in this election , many more will begin to vote if they feel thier vote can bring change.[/quote] <40% of eligible voters, that's sad. You're tired of money grubbing and corruption and you are glad the Democrats won? Do you REALLY think that there's any difference between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to lobbyist activities? The only difference is that the Democrats will get a higher percentage of lobbyists' money for the next 2 years because they have the majority. If you want real reform in Washington, you need bold moves. 1. Prohibit any retiring member of Congress from working for any company that they regulated while in office 2. Enact full disclosure requirements for any contact with lobbyists under penalty of perjury if not disclosed. 3. Set a monetary limit on any gifts or ""in kind"" entertainment. 4. Limit the size of Congressional staffers to a few per member. 5. Eliminate all gov't ONLY benefit programs. Make Congress use commercial HMOs and PPOs just like the rest of us. Make them part of SS and eliminate gov't only pension plans and their liberal qualification requirements.","can-third-party-ever-make","01:16 PM","government-debates","38"

When the movement gets huge media will cover it and most people in this country are concerned that goverment is screwing them now as they watch the good jobs all disapearing . They bit the hand that fed them with Nafta and Cafta . True most people were ignoring the corruption as long as the money was trickling down.

Just look at the coverage of Iraq. When was the last time that you read a ""good"" story coming from there? Yet, when I;'ve talked with veterans, they have told me all sorts of good things that are happening. We wouldn't have to worry about NAFTA and CAFTA if our own government wasn't driving businesses overseas with high taxation and unnecessary regulations.","can-third-party-ever-make","03:44 PM","government-debates","41"

They should allow each person to debate regardless of how many there are and then let the poeple vote all in the same day who the president is, not vote to represent a party. That is the only fair way to hold an election. There are already more than two parties that run for president, libertarian, communist, prohibition, liberal, green, independant, and I can't remember the other one or ones, but they are out there if you care to look. People are only voting on the most popular 2 because they think other parties take way votes from main two parties. This is a crock because the votes didn't belong to the party anyways. People are going to have to make a change to get rid of what's moving into our government. Bush has already appointed himself a dictatorship and nobody care to impeach him. What a shame!","can-third-party-ever-make","03:16 AM","government-debates","43"
