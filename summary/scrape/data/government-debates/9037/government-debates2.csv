"10-16-2006","9037",2,"Steeeeve","235129","You could probably claim these things about a lot of cultures...just look at Europe. Good question. US voter turnout for presidential elections has been consistent since 1900 http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0763629.html which included the great depression, two world wars and our recent run of extreme prosperity. America's general population, lower through upper middle classes, has taken the lead from our self-serving politicians of always blaming someone or something else for their problems. From a societal point of view it will be interesting to see who they blame when economic conditions greatly reduce their standard of living and there's no one but politicians to point the finger at.","Big_Bear_Scot","235155","I would agree, gone are the days when thousands of working class people would vote and actually shake up Governments. Those working class people are now more concerned with what is on TV than the inequality that is inherent in the Capitalist system.* It is just the same as it was in antiquity when the Roman's gave people the Games to distract them from their misery. Now it is the TV that has replaced the games. I am kind of lucky I don't live in a Two Party system, in Scotland we have a mixed system where some Representatives are elected by First Past the Post system and others are elected through Proportional Representation. This means that the Scottish Parliament consists of 4 Major Parties and 3 Minor Parties. Of course our system has its flaws as well, Collation Government, confusing electoral system and if could also mean that the largest party has to modify its platform to accommodate a junior partner. I might dig out some numbers for turn out to see if we have a higher turnout for national elections than the US. Don't worry the politicians will probably find some sort of Scapegoat, they will probably blame some Dirty Foreigner or they will manufacture some sort of War as distraction. I wonder then is it the system that is the problem ? Or is it the people that inhabit that system(politicians) ? So if we replace the current Politicians with regular Joe's would they sink into the same pit, held back by the system *my opinion only I wouldn't like to pollute this thread with Off Topic debates, if you want to discuss it with me start a new thread.","can-third-party-ever-make","02:45 PM","government-debates","16"
"10-16-2006","9037",2,"DrNo","None","This is what has happened with third parties in the past, but it doesn't always mean it will happen every time. There are millions of eligible voters in this country that simply choose not to vote. If a third party could get these people motivated to vote for them and also get some votes from the more moderate members of the other parties, I think they could win.","billsco","235172","I have to ask: What does a third party have to offer? The answer to date appears to be nothing. They garner some sympathy votes from people who relate to their criticisms of the two party system. They are quite good at pointing out the shortcomings and faults of the present system. But what do they offer? What do you mean by ""more moderate members of the other parties""?","can-third-party-ever-make","04:33 PM","government-debates","17"

There is some variety in the specific candidates, but what if someone believes different than the Republicans and the Democrats on an issue? Many people just choose the one that closest fits their belief. I don't even care about the party, but you'd think when looking at who to vote for in a race you would consider the actual candidates and not only the 2 main candidates running (Democrat and Republican). That's my problem. If you truly think the Democrat or Republican will represent you best, vote for them. But please don't vote for one of them when there is another candidate that would represent your views much better.","can-third-party-ever-make","06:23 PM","government-debates","18"

I think you fell for the bait and switch our government pulled on us. We will not be switching to paper ballots. They may be switching to paper vote rolls if the ""repaired"" Diebold machines don't work this time. You know the index cards they used to use to verify your registration before you can vote?

"10-19-2006","9037",2,"DrNo","235104","Sometime this month the USA is going to hit the 300 million mark in population. Assuming that half of these people are eligible voters (150 million) and knowing that around 65 million people voted in the last election, I estimate there are around 85 million votes up for grabs. It seems like if we could get these people motivated to vote, the number would more than make up for the districts. Especially if we could get some support from the more moderate voters who had previously voted for the main parties. Is this logic incorrect? What am I missing ?","JPSartre12","235645","Free beer and potato chips?","can-third-party-ever-make","09:44 PM","government-debates","24"

In Britain we use paper ballots for all elections currently, and there has been one disputed election that I can recall in recent years, and that was with a margin of 2 votes in the election of an MP (about 30-40k votes to be counted). The advantage with paper is that it can be checked and checked again, and doesn't rely on any one company or individual to be unbiased.","can-third-party-ever-make","05:34 PM","government-debates","28"

A dodgy electronic result is a lot more difficult to work out, if the software was corrupted all votes are potentially spoilt. I think the optimal system with current technology would be a punchcard system that electronically memorises every vote cast on it, that way there is a electronically counted result and physical votes as double.","can-third-party-ever-make","06:09 PM","government-debates","29"
"10-20-2006","9037",2,"None","None","None","billsco","235789","Paper ballots of course leave a paper trail. It's the twists and turns of that trail that cause the degree of error. For instance, every election cycle it seems we get a news story about a guy who got pulled over for a burned out taillight and had twenty ballot boxes in the trunk. What is that about? Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago is widely believed to have delivered his city to John Kennedy in the '60 election by bogus ballots. My only point is that no system is fool-proof, and we shouldn't dismiss electronic methods out of hand.","can-third-party-ever-make","08:53 PM","government-debates","30"
