The people are no longer in control, and politician is not a civil service...it's a career. Our government practices the theory of ""divide and conquer"" by giving us two sides of every issue. Liberals and Democrats side up versus conservatives and Republicans and it becomes a sport. Each side tries to shoot down the other and score points for their ""team."" Everybody seems to forget we all play for the same team....America. My question is this: Can a thrid party ever make it in this country and, if so, is the time now? I think our country is crying out for a third party more now then ever before. The far left and far right ideas are just not those of the majority. If they were, they wouldn't be considered ""far.""","can-third-party-ever-make","10:28 AM","government-debates","1"

US voter turnout for presidential elections has been consistent since 1900 http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0763629.html which included the great depression, two world wars and our recent run of extreme prosperity. My opinion would be no change in US voting habits without an extreme economic depression. I base that on US population migration from rural, somewhat self-sufficient family status up to WW2 to a primarily metropolitan population following WW2. The secondary migration from industrial to service economy is again increasing metropolitan populations at the cost of rural lifestyles and that somewhat self-sustaining status. America's general population, lower through upper middle classes, has taken the lead from our self-serving politicians of always blaming someone or something else for their problems. From a societal point of view it will be interesting to see who they blame when economic conditions greatly reduce their standard of living and there's no one but politicians to point the finger at.","can-third-party-ever-make","12:43 PM","government-debates","15"

Those working class people are now more concerned with what is on TV than the inequality that is inherent in the Capitalist system.* It is just the same as it was in antiquity when the Roman's gave people the Games to distract them from their misery. Now it is the TV that has replaced the games. I am kind of lucky I don't live in a Two Party system, in Scotland we have a mixed system where some Representatives are elected by First Past the Post system and others are elected through Proportional Representation. This means that the Scottish Parliament consists of 4 Major Parties and 3 Minor Parties. Of course our system has its flaws as well, Collation Government, confusing electoral system and if could also mean that the largest party has to modify its platform to accommodate a junior partner. I might dig out some numbers for turn out to see if we have a higher turnout for national elections than the US. Don't worry the politicians will probably find some sort of Scapegoat, they will probably blame some Dirty Foreigner or they will manufacture some sort of War as distraction. I wonder then is it the system that is the problem ? Or is it the people that inhabit that system(politicians) ? So if we replace the current Politicians with regular Joe's would they sink into the same pit, held back by the system *my opinion only I wouldn't like to pollute this thread with Off Topic debates, if you want to discuss it with me start a new thread.","can-third-party-ever-make","02:45 PM","government-debates","16"

A national petition to enact term limits can be forced to be posted in each politicians local office , as well as in public places all over the nation. The key is 60 million plus voted in this election , many more will begin to vote if they feel thier vote can bring change. Its important to not let it be business as usual , but to show them we are tired of the corruption and money grubbing in Washington and our state houses and we the citizens are paying attention , and we will continue to pay attention till they act to change things. I am working on a document for petition of my local congressmen and Senator now. I suggest everybody do the same and when it catch's on somebody smarter than me can take it national and maybe we can throw the lobbists out of the goverment.","Steeeeve","239928","HAHA, this coulda been written in 1890 (minus the 60million voting) and it would apply to what most people think. Welcome to US politics where no one has been happy since 1776","can-third-party-ever-make","03:30 PM","government-debates","39"

Media coverage and citizen participation is all thats needed . When the movement gets huge media will cover it and most people in this country are concerned that goverment is screwing them now as they watch the good jobs all disapearing . They bit the hand that fed them with Nafta and Cafta . True most people were ignoring the corruption as long as the money was trickling down. That trickle is drying up and the entire country is starting to take notice of that.","can-third-party-ever-make","02:08 AM","government-debates","40"

Just look at the coverage of Iraq. When was the last time that you read a ""good"" story coming from there? Yet, when I;'ve talked with veterans, they have told me all sorts of good things that are happening. We wouldn't have to worry about NAFTA and CAFTA if our own government wasn't driving businesses overseas with high taxation and unnecessary regulations.","can-third-party-ever-make","03:44 PM","government-debates","41"

They should allow each person to debate regardless of how many there are and then let the poeple vote all in the same day who the president is, not vote to represent a party. That is the only fair way to hold an election. There are already more than two parties that run for president, libertarian, communist, prohibition, liberal, green, independant, and I can't remember the other one or ones, but they are out there if you care to look. People are only voting on the most popular 2 because they think other parties take way votes from main two parties. This is a crock because the votes didn't belong to the party anyways. People are going to have to make a change to get rid of what's moving into our government. Bush has already appointed himself a dictatorship and nobody care to impeach him. What a shame!","can-third-party-ever-make","03:16 AM","government-debates","43"
