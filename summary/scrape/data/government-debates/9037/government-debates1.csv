The people are no longer in control, and politician is not a civil service...it's a career. Our government practices the theory of ""divide and conquer"" by giving us two sides of every issue. Liberals and Democrats side up versus conservatives and Republicans and it becomes a sport. Each side tries to shoot down the other and score points for their ""team."" Everybody seems to forget we all play for the same team....America. My question is this: Can a thrid party ever make it in this country and, if so, is the time now? I think our country is crying out for a third party more now then ever before. The far left and far right ideas are just not those of the majority. If they were, they wouldn't be considered ""far.""","can-third-party-ever-make","10:28 AM","government-debates","1"

The two main parties then include the ideas of the 3 party within their platforms. Both main parties are both conservative. The republicans more then the democrats. If some one is liberal they don't vote for the the liberal party, such as the greens, because then that would split the democatic party giving the Fascist leaning republicans more power.","can-third-party-ever-make","01:34 PM","government-debates","2"

There are millions of eligible voters in this country that simply choose not to vote. If a third party could get these people motivated to vote for them and also get some votes from the more moderate members of the other parties, I think they could win.","can-third-party-ever-make","02:11 PM","government-debates","3"

""All civilized societies would be divided into different sects, factions, and interests, ...of rich and poor, debtors and creditors, ... the inhabitants of this district or that district, the followers of this political leader or that political leader, the disciples of this religious sect or that religious sect. In all cases where a majority are united by a common interest or passion, the rights of the minority are in danger."" - James Madison","can-third-party-ever-make","07:44 PM","government-debates","4"

The country has been redistricted, the electoral process ""tweaked"" and incumbent protection laws put in place that are strong enough that there is absolutly no possibility. IF it was possible for a third party to end up holding the white house (which it is not), they woudl have a great deal of trouble actually getting int hre, largely doue to the McCain feingold incumbent protection...er...I mean...campaign finance reform laws.","can-third-party-ever-make","11:07 PM","government-debates","5"

That way you would need under 25% of the popular vote to still win the Presidency under the electoral college system.","can-third-party-ever-make","11:41 PM","government-debates","6"

When they came up with it, it was a good idea. Now iut has been subverted to the point that all it really does is ensures a 2 party system.","can-third-party-ever-make","01:28 AM","government-debates","7"
"10-16-2006","9037",1,"None","None","None","DrNo","235104","Sometime this month the USA is going to hit the 300 million mark in population. Assuming that half of these people are eligible voters (150 million) and knowing that around 65 million people voted in the last election, I estimate there are around 85 million votes up for grabs. It seems like if we could get these people motivated to vote, the number would more than make up for the districts. Especially if we could get some support from the more moderate voters who had previously voted for the main parties. Is this logic incorrect? What am I missing?","can-third-party-ever-make","09:39 AM","government-debates","8"

The US has many factors that set up a 2 party system. Electoral college, winner take all (kind of the same), tons of elections, the 2 parties stealing the 3rd parties ideas, and things of that nature. People justify not voting for a 3rd party because they want their vote to ""mean something""...what they don't realize is that it already means next to nothing so why not vote for a 3rd party...atleast you voted your heart. I personally have voted for a libertarian, a democrat, a republican, and a write-in. In fact, I might write-in someone for senate this year (Va Senate race). oh well.","can-third-party-ever-make","12:22 PM","government-debates","14"

US voter turnout for presidential elections has been consistent since 1900 http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0763629.html which included the great depression, two world wars and our recent run of extreme prosperity. My opinion would be no change in US voting habits without an extreme economic depression. I base that on US population migration from rural, somewhat self-sufficient family status up to WW2 to a primarily metropolitan population following WW2. The secondary migration from industrial to service economy is again increasing metropolitan populations at the cost of rural lifestyles and that somewhat self-sustaining status. America's general population, lower through upper middle classes, has taken the lead from our self-serving politicians of always blaming someone or something else for their problems. From a societal point of view it will be interesting to see who they blame when economic conditions greatly reduce their standard of living and there's no one but politicians to point the finger at.","can-third-party-ever-make","12:43 PM","government-debates","15"
