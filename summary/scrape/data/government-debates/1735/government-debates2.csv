America is a ""mixture"" of mass confusion and the Statue of Liberty is a Drag Queen","daewoo","36642","No problem, but it is going to be a short (simple) compare and contrast. Otherwise there wouldn't be enough room ont he server for it. In a democracy (pure), majority rules. 51% of the population can do whatever they want. You could concievably get 51% of the population together and vote to exterminate the other 49%. In a constitutional republic, we have a more limited form of democracy, namely democracy ruled by a constitution. We cannot hold a direct vote to execute all the minorities, as they are protected under our constitution. We also do not have a direct democracy in America. In a pure direct democracy, a bill would be introduced and we would all vote on it. Instead we have a representative democracy, where we elect folks to go vote for us. I could point out that the existance of a two party system in the US further limits our democracy, but I would digress and that is really not the topic of this thread. Communism as defined by Marx (and there have been several other definitions) basically consists of a thinly veiled anarchy. Marx believed that the problem with capitolism was that the workers didn't own the means of production (the factories). His vision of communism involved a brief stint of socialism (will get to that in a moment) followed by an overthrow of the govenment (and even marx was realistic enough to note that the overhrow would most likely have to be a violent one). The end idea being more or less collective ownership of the means of production by the people and (more or less) people working for the joy of it. Socialism is somewhat similar o communism, only with the government representing the people and owning the means of production. Unfortunatly, we have found that a socialist structure is by necessity a totalitarian one, and under socialism people tend to die or be sent to re-education camps.","distinction","12:51 PM","government-debates","16"

Marx spoke of the proletarian dictatorship and the proletarian demcoracy interchangeably. The democratic ideal of the socialisic period was an important feature in Marx`s teachings. And he argued that only through direct democracy (or equivalent) where the citizens had total control of legislation could the socialistic period be achieved. The (often misunderstood) phrase ""Proletarian dictatorship"" must be understood in its contents where Marx argued that the liberal democracy was nothing more than the dictatorship of the burgoise as the interest of the masterclass, the capital owners, where the main interest pursued by the state. And conversely, in the socialist state where the workers own the means of production, this interests of the workers will be the main interest pursued by the state. This is why the socialist state must in disapear in the end, as the citizens can never be truly free while governed by a state that pursues certain economic (or class-) interests. From a theoretical view it is very doubtful that the liberal democracy would be any more democratic than the socialist democracy. But regardless, Marx would view them both as forms dictatoships. Lenin on the other hand....","distinction","07:38 AM","government-debates","21"

Even if the initial phase was a dictatorship (and I disagree that Marx just meant for that) then the only purpose was to implace the will of a singular on the people so as to establish a specific framework. In democracy, the will of the majority can and does change and things are fluid. That is not true in ""true communism."" Certainly the ideal of communal living where each shares in the productivity of the whole has some desirability, it neglects the fact that people are different and combine together to provide uneven distribution of skills. This was a problem with Marxism. While the theory had a wonderful result as its goal, it neglected the differences that inherently exist in people. Democracy does force a will on the people, but not the will of a singualr, and the will can and does change. It allows for the uneven distribution of skills but does not inherently take care of those with fewer skills.

All other was irrelevant to Marx as he believed all else was a product of these two colliding interests. And while it is true that a socialistic society (as a transatory phase in the Marxist ideology) would require the framework of confiscating the means of production (and by so doing, pursuing the interest of the working class) it is no more the will of a singular than the current system, where the interests of the capitalist class is being pursued by the state. If you argue that the socialistic transitory state would be inherrantly oppressive, Marx would have agreed with you, but he would have countered with our liberal democracies being much more oppressive and void of democracy. Marxism rellies on the idea of class interests. Without it, the ideology fails. With it democracy becomes the self evident product of a socialistic transitory state. Direct (or radical) democracy was advocated by Marx himself. Communism (in theory) is not an alternative to democracy. Just as little as conservatism is. Democracy deals with how the state should be ruled. But if we are talking about practice, you are historicly correct. Communism and (liberal) democracy was long seen as two bi-polaristic ideals. Modern socialism and the fall of the iron curtain has made this distinction less apparant. No longer can we define democracy as not-communist. We are faced with a huge problem, having to re-define democracy.","distinction","10:30 AM","government-debates","23"

It is impossible to perfectly and evenly distribute skill sets throughout a country, let alone the world (frankly if not worldwide, it is not true communism). In the first place, skill sets are notoriously difficult to quantitate. Secondly, forced use of a specific set of skills naturally produces lower productions capacity as humans will not submit to REQUIRED use of specific skills or even the required development of specific skills. Some will, to be sure, butmost won't. Communism simply cannot take into account those items. Democracy does take them into account as it allows for individualized opportunity.

It renounces income diferences originating from the ownership of the means of production. ""From each according to his ability, too each according to his need"" is often used as an argument for equalisation of resources, but this is not its proper meaning AFIK. After all, even certain liberal thinkers expressed similiar ideas. What is stressed with the quote is solidarity towards those who are in great need, and that those who can afford should do so. This is not even different from most conservative thinkers as well. The only distinction is perhaps that Marx would argue that this should be done through the state (ie; democraticly sanctionised and institutionalised violence) You could also argue that the present liberal democracy oppresses certain skills and promoting others. Afterall, the skill of being able to extract resources through violence is commonly oppressed in this day and age. As for the economic problems of Marxism. Here, I`m inclined to agree. The market powers are exceptionally good at maximizing production and I think they should be utilized to create economic progress. But in defense of Marx, I must point out that he argued that the RevolutionTM could only take place in a world where economic progress has eradicated all economic ""need"", replacing it with economic ""want"". It is also noteworthy to point out that the economic situation in the capitalistic economy where very different during the 1800 than they are today.","distinction","11:30 AM","government-debates","26"

The socialistic state is when there actually exists a state, the true communistic state is when the state has withered away. Now, to address the issue. ""Artificial"" cultivation of skills is ever present. Regardless of economic or political system. The ""natural"" cultivation of skills would be terribly inefficiant from an economic perspective as it would encourage the skill of extracting resources through violence. The artificial cultivation of skills that would emerge in a socialistic (as in transitory to communism) state could just as well be based on individual preferences. It is just that preferences would have to be shifted from maximum economic gratification to something else (such as ""psychological"" gratification). This form of preferences are even common in a capitalistic system. You would just have to increase its importance (which Marx would argue would be the case when our ""false consiousness"" would dissapear). Another way is of course to tie the societal needs to personal economic gratification. Yet again something that is being done everyday in the capitalistic system.","distinction","02:45 PM","government-debates","30"
