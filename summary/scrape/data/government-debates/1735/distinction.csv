How can you compare democracy to communism in regards to crime and oppression? It seems like the raw data would be a little difficult to come across, since there has never been a communist system in place. Did you perhaps mean to say ""socialism"" as opposed to ""communism""? Socialism and communism are two different things. I am not sure why people use the term interchangably. While the two do share some funadmental principals, they also share some pretty vast differences. It seems like, on paper, the two are radically different. Of course, the argument must stop there, as there has never been an implementation of communism that we can study. I would put forth that the current democracy in America does have some similarities to a socialist regime, such as massive taxes, widespread social programs and a firm belief by some in the need for ""social justice"". Beyond that, you are back into party politics. If you were talking about socialism, I hardly think that an over abundance of freedom in the socialist systems of government we have seen so far. Of course, if you want a look at a crime free society, you need simply study the soviet union before the fall of socialism. They had some of the lowest crime rates in the world. Of course, this was partly the result of their police tactics, and party the result of the cleansing of their society by the slaughter of ""undesirables"". I fail to see where you are leading with this. Could you please calrify?","distinction","09:19 PM","government-debates","5"

The US is one of the lowest taxed Western countries period...","daewoo","34594","According to the Congressional Research Service, we spend $400 billion per year on social programs. 2/3 of that comes from federal funding. To me, $400 billion is a whole lot of money, and qualifies under the heading of ""massive"". Massive is, of course, a subjecive term, so to some people, $400 billion might not be massive. As far as the tax question, ""The US is one of the lowest taxed Western countries period"", should probably read ""The Us is one of the lowest taxed Western countries in regards to income taxes. According to the Tax Foundation, just calculating Federal income tax, State and local income taxes, Payroll taxes, employer portions of federal taxes and ""otehr federal taxes"", in 1998, Americans were loosing 39% of their income to some form of payroll collection tax. This doesn't even take into account sales taxers, transportation (fuel) taxes, food taxes, garbage collection taxes, and the whole myriad of other ""incidental"" taxes. The ""cost of government"" day in 2003 was july 11. I came up with this date by compariing ""cost of government day"" estimated from a dozen different sources and averaging the results. All the sources I saw used similar techniques to arrive at that date. All the sources I used attempted to use reliable estimation processes to establish estimations on point of sale taxes paid, and used recognised nationwide averages in calculating muicipal taxes. By my calculations, there are rougly 260 working days in a year, and approximatly 137 of those fall before the cost of government day. Assuming you make the same amount of money throughout the year (whic is a base assumtion in calculating cost of government day), that means that rougly 52.6% of your entire income is going to pay some type of tax. All of a sudden, the US numbers do not look so hot. To me, a 52% tax load is massive. Tht means you are working over half the year to pay uncle sam.","distinction","02:25 AM","government-debates","7"

We cannot hold a direct vote to execute all the minorities, as they are protected under our constitution. We also do not have a direct democracy in America.

I could point out that the existance of a two party system in the US further limits our democracy, but I would digress and that is really not the topic of this thread. Communism as defined by Marx (and there have been several other definitions) basically consists of a thinly veiled anarchy. Marx believed that the problem with capitolism was that the workers didn't own the means of production (the factories). His vision of communism involved a brief stint of socialism (will get to that in a moment) followed by an overthrow of the govenment (and even marx was realistic enough to note that the overhrow would most likely have to be a violent one).

Marx spoke of the proletarian dictatorship and the proletarian demcoracy interchangeably. The democratic ideal of the socialisic period was an important feature in Marx`s teachings. And he argued that only through direct democracy (or equivalent) where the citizens had total control of legislation could the socialistic period be achieved. The (often misunderstood) phrase ""Proletarian dictatorship"" must be understood in its contents where Marx argued that the liberal democracy was nothing more than the dictatorship of the burgoise as the interest of the masterclass, the capital owners, where the main interest pursued by the state. And conversely, in the socialist state where the workers own the means of production, this interests of the workers will be the main interest pursued by the state. This is why the socialist state must in disapear in the end, as the citizens can never be truly free while governed by a state that pursues certain economic (or class-) interests. From a theoretical view it is very doubtful that the liberal democracy would be any more democratic than the socialist democracy. But regardless, Marx would view them both as forms dictatoships.

It renounces income diferences originating from the ownership of the means of production. ""From each according to his ability, too each according to his need"" is often used as an argument for equalisation of resources, but this is not its proper meaning AFIK. After all, even certain liberal thinkers expressed similiar ideas. What is stressed with the quote is solidarity towards those who are in great need, and that those who can afford should do so. This is not even different from most conservative thinkers as well. The only distinction is perhaps that Marx would argue that this should be done through the state (ie; democraticly sanctionised and institutionalised violence) You could also argue that the present liberal democracy oppresses certain skills and promoting others. Afterall, the skill of being able to extract resources through violence is commonly oppressed in this day and age. As for the economic problems of Marxism. Here, I`m inclined to agree. The market powers are exceptionally good at maximizing production and I think they should be utilized to create economic progress. But in defense of Marx, I must point out that he argued that the RevolutionTM could only take place in a world where economic progress has eradicated all economic ""need"", replacing it with economic ""want"". It is also noteworthy to point out that the economic situation in the capitalistic economy where very different during the 1800 than they are today.","distinction","11:30 AM","government-debates","26"

Note the same root for three words, state, statis, and status. It is because the state's essential nature and function is to provide the other two. Democracy on the other hand is intended to change as people change. It is why the US has the longest standing constitution of any country on the planet.

It also necessitates an uneven distribution for the state. I agree with Fracas, there must be a state because without it, there can be no stasis as people change from generation to generation as do preferences. The state forces the status quo. Note the same root for three words, state, statis, and status. It is because the state's essential nature and function is to provide the other two. Democracy on the other hand is intended to change as people change. It is why the US has the longest standing constitution of any country on the planet. Granted we are a republic and not a true democracy, but it is the maleability that allows the constitution to adapt as times change.

Secondly, I`m arguing that vocation will be present in the socialistic society, but it is not necessarily based on econmic profit maximation. Nor do I see how the socialistic society remove personal preferences for vocation. About state and communism We are really disscussing two things here. First, we are discussing the socialistic transatory state. This is the state that will own all the means of production. Secondly; we are discussing the mythical state-lessness of true communism. True communism is basicly the utopia that will only be achieved once we as humans have evolved economicly, socially, phsycologicly, emotionally etc. The exact nature of true communism is not exactly disscused in detail by Marx (or by any Marxist I know off). Marx did not want to make predictions about something that he could not fully comprehend, his basic assumption was that as the state is inherrantly exploitive and oppressive, regardless of political system, it would have to wither away so that mankind could be free. Regardless if this utopian state-lesness is achievable or not (something, I highly doubt), you cannot get away from the fact that the basis of this stage is to remove the state. But this is where Marx would say that you are wrong. People do not change. Their core interests are the same regardless of generation, nationality, ethnicity, religion etc. The core interests of the people is class interests, and those only change when the economic system change. All other form of identity or preference are based on false consciessnes or false identities. Now, this is something marxism has been heavily critisiced for (and rightly so) but it doesn`t change the fact that, according to Marx, the socialistic society (as a transatory state to communism) would be based on direct democratic influence of its class- conscious citizens. There would be no change in the economical or political system as it would go against the class interest of the numerical majority (the working class).","distinction","04:09 PM","government-debates","34"

At that point, the people are entirely subjegated to the government for their means of support. I hink this is the key difference between socialism and democracy. In one system, the people need the government, in the other system, the government needs the people. Under a non-socialist democracy, the government has no profitable business, the government posseses no money. They have no means of support beyond the taxes that are paid by the people. I a socialist system, the people have no business, no means of support, beyond the money the government pays them. It seems like historically, he who has the gold makes the rules. This is why I find it particularly disturbing that people get in a huff when you debate taxation in the US. In the US we have a fairly low income tax, but there are huge numbers of point of use/sale taxes, fees, etc... that are stacked on top of those income taxes (realistically we pay over 50% of our wages in some kind of tax).

If you want to use other definitions, please tell me, and we`ll work something out. Marxism: A school of thought. Socialism as a transatory state to communism: A state that owns all the means of production. True communism: The utopia that will arise once the socialistic state has withered waway (Ie; no government or state at all... think social-anarchism) Social democracy: A rather socio-liberal ideal that has its roots in marxist theory. Believes that market powers must be harnessed to serve the purpose of the society or collective. Believes in reforms rather than revolution. He feared that any attempt to overthrow the socialistic state could be bloody because the master class would not willingly abolish themsleves, regardless wether they where democraticly elected or not. Marx feared that the overthrowment of the liberal democracy would be bloody as well, not because it would not be in the interest of the political and numerical majority, but because the owners of the means of production and the political and economical elites of the liberal democracy would not allow it. I would not autmoaticly brand liberal democracies as traditional dictatorship, nor do I think that Marx would have either. In the early days of social democracy, I think you are correct. However, social democracy has evolved alot since then. I think there are few active social democrats today who would argue that all the means of production should be in the hands of the state. Only where it serves important purposes or where it is economicly efficient should the state own the means of production. This is often how social democratic countries have acted. Not by nationalising production of goods and services, but rather creating certain services and retaining some national control over certain important sectors (like Norway retaining national control of the oil production). It is a good question. Allthough I would argue that social democrats generally do not want the state to control all the means of production. But the question is still interesting as social democrats wants more (democratic) governmental control of the economy. ""Would then more governmental control lead to less democracy?"". From a scial democrats perspective, the answer would surely be no. After all, if the government is controlled by democratic majority, more governmental control would surely equal more democratic control, no?. Phew... I`ve been writing like a maniac all morning.

I see your point. I think you see my point. The final of which is: Communism and transatroy sociallism cannot work as they do not take into account the true nature of human beings. They, instead are based on a false assumption concerning people's abilities. After the fall of the USSR one of the main problems that they had was that they had no idea how to get people to obey laws or even to act charitably. They called upon church leaders from many nations to discuss the issue of morality and what governments could do to encourage this in their citizens. This is the point that socialism and communism cannot handle. The redistribution that happens is not according to effort or opportunity but need. It is forced charity (also known as tax, which we have been discussing in yet another thread). People naturally rebel against that which is forced. Democracy and capitalism take advantage of that fact. It is why there are so many dollars spent on advertising. Anyway, beyond this, my knowledge of true communism dwindles.

Sorry about the late reply, but I hope your trip to Vegas was a good one. And yes, you are thinking along the right lines here. As for as governmental control over the economy, I think you can look at it as a sliding scale. With libertarians and various forms of anarchists at one end and communists at the other. Social democrats would be closer to the communists than for example liberals. But in some cases (or countries), conservatives would be closer to communists when it comes to governmental control. However, if you look at it more closely you`ll find that there are indeed some important differences between the different ideologies, even when it comes to governmental control. The agriculture sector is for example a very important sector for many conservatives. Protecting ones food production and the cultural tradition derived from this sector is paramount for the for the nations interests and protektionism is a common practice. But for social democrats, the agriculture sector is not important. In fact, one of the most historicly important issue for the swedish social democrats was abolishing tarriffs on agriculture products. I would however say that the US has far to ""go"" (or fall, depending on how you view it ) before the intensity of governmental control becomes close to modern social democratic standards. I would also argue that the US wellfare system is very different from those in european social democratic countries and it is legitimized on completly different grounds (most probably pure equal opportunity ideal, while social democracy would talk about lessening the class difference).

DOes the government own them directly, or is it sometimes a case of strict controls instead of outright ownership? Also, I would have to disagree thet welfare systems in America are an equal opportunity ideal. It seems that the welfare system in America is designed for the sole purpose of keeping the poor poor. Beside our standard welfare system, we have instituted a number of ""tax credits"" for poor people, and designed it so they get back more than they pay in, often tot he tune of thousands of dollars. In order to meet the criteria for these programs, you have to make beneath a certain threshold. The more you make, the less you get back. Interestingly enough, though, he way te system is set up, by if you make enough money to no longer get the credit, you are actualy loosing money overall because the additional money that you make does not make up for the lost credit. Also, currently in america, you make more money collecting government benifits such as wellfare, food stamps, etc... Than you would working a ob that pays minimum wage. To me this is not indicitive of a system set up on the ideals of equal opportunity, this is a system set up with the purpose of assisting the poor, but instead has done nothing but add to their ranks and ensure that muli-billion dollar comapnies have a large base of low end workers to choose from.","Eddie","37718","Hard to say actually. The oil example was about Norway. The equivalent sector in Sweden would be the wood industry, and even though the social democratic party in sweden has had the most substantial influence of any political party, the wood industry is owned by private interests. Governmental ownership is generally about wellfare institutions, such as the educational system, healthcare, power supply, public transportations etc. But even these sectors are being being challanged by the rising demands of economic efficiency, by some, attributed to increased internationalisation. But the privatisation ""wave"" has been followed by a large increase in regulations and strict control. So to answer your question... both I`m not saying that your assesment is wrong. After all, I don`t live in the US, but are you sure that the intentions of the democrats (regardless of outcome) is not equal oppurtunity?
