The idea with the true communistic state is that it is state-less. Marx argued that the state was inherrantly oppressive and exploitive. To be able to create a society without oppression and exploitation, the state must wither away where a social-anarcho type of society would emerge. And without state, there would be no government.","distinction","03:09 PM","government-debates","32"
"03-01-2004","1735",3,"Eddie","None","Socialism made its appearance as the transitory state between the (liberal democratic) capitalistic system and true communism It is also during the transatory socialistic state the dictatorship of the proletariate is said to emerge. The socialistic state is when there actually exists a state, the true communistic state is when the state has withered away. Now, to address the issue. ""Artificial"" cultivation of skills is ever present. Regardless of economic or political system. The ""natural"" cultivation of skills would be terribly inefficiant from an economic perspective as it would encourage the skill of extracting resources through violence. The artificial cultivation of skills that would emerge in a socialistic (as in transitory to communism) state could just as well be based on individual preferences. It is just that preferences would have to be shifted from maximum economic gratification to something else (such as ""psychological"" gratification). This form of preferences are even common in a capitalistic system. You would just have to increase its importance (which Marx would argue would be the case when our ""false consiousness"" would dissapear). Another way is of course to tie the societal needs to personal economic gratification. Yet again something that is being done everyday in the capitalistic system.","epaphras_faith","37215","While they may be present in capitalism, the issue is democracy. Democracy necessitates individual preference toward vocation. It also necessitates an uneven distribution for the state. I agree with Fracas, there must be a state because without it, there can be no stasis as people change from generation to generation as do preferences. The state forces the status quo. Note the same root for three words, state, statis, and status. It is because the state's essential nature and function is to provide the other two. Democracy on the other hand is intended to change as people change. It is why the US has the longest standing constitution of any country on the planet. Granted we are a republic and not a true democracy, but it is the maleability that allows the constitution to adapt as times change. It also provides the consistency necessary without (ideally) the detriment of the individual.","distinction","03:23 PM","government-debates","33"

Secondly, I`m arguing that vocation will be present in the socialistic society, but it is not necessarily based on econmic profit maximation. Nor do I see how the socialistic society remove personal preferences for vocation. About state and communism We are really disscussing two things here. First, we are discussing the socialistic transatory state. This is the state that will own all the means of production. Secondly; we are discussing the mythical state-lessness of true communism. True communism is basicly the utopia that will only be achieved once we as humans have evolved economicly, socially, phsycologicly, emotionally etc. The exact nature of true communism is not exactly disscused in detail by Marx (or by any Marxist I know off). Marx did not want to make predictions about something that he could not fully comprehend, his basic assumption was that as the state is inherrantly exploitive and oppressive, regardless of political system, it would have to wither away so that mankind could be free. Regardless if this utopian state-lesness is achievable or not (something, I highly doubt), you cannot get away from the fact that the basis of this stage is to remove the state. But this is where Marx would say that you are wrong. People do not change. Their core interests are the same regardless of generation, nationality, ethnicity, religion etc. The core interests of the people is class interests, and those only change when the economic system change. All other form of identity or preference are based on false consciessnes or false identities. Now, this is something marxism has been heavily critisiced for (and rightly so) but it doesn`t change the fact that, according to Marx, the socialistic society (as a transatory state to communism) would be based on direct democratic influence of its class- conscious citizens. There would be no change in the economical or political system as it would go against the class interest of the numerical majority (the working class).","distinction","04:09 PM","government-debates","34"

A quick background: Eddie (I think it was eddie) was discussing the theory of a social democracy I find the theory intersting and wished to discuss it further, but eddie pointed out it does not belong in the gun control forum, so it is here, instead. I think that the answer depends on how you percieve Marx when he talks about a ""benign"" dictatorship. He does refer to democracy as a form of dictatorship, which muddies the waters a little bit. It seems, though, that since he acknowledges that the transformation from benign dictatorship to a pure communistic society would most likey require a violent overthrow, that his intention as far as a ""benign dictatorship"" leans more towards a traditional dictatorship than a symbolic one. A dictatorship is pretty incompatible with the ideals of democracy. As far as ""social democracy"" goes, I will admit I am not well versed int he concept. The limited amount of knowledge I have collected on the subject suggests to me that a socialist democracy is nothing more than a precursor to the ""benign dictatorship"" (pure socialism) that Marx referred to. I do support certain changes that would be considered by some to be socialist. An exaple would be the funding of post secondary education by the government, which is an excellet way to ensure the future of your country. I would even consider government ownership of certain companies that are vital to the public interest to be a concept worth consideration (such as canada and their oil company). I guess my question is, once social democracy has run its course and the government is in control of the majority of businesses (thus controlling the means of production), why would they bother with the will of the people any more? At that point, the people are entirely subjegated to the government for their means of support. I hink this is the key difference between socialism and democracy. In one system, the people need the government, in the other system, the government needs the people. Under a non-socialist democracy, the government has no profitable business, the government posseses no money. They have no means of support beyond the taxes that are paid by the people. I a socialist system, the people have no business, no means of support, beyond the money the government pays them. It seems like historically, he who has the gold makes the rules. This is why I find it particularly disturbing that people get in a huff when you debate taxation in the US. In the US we have a fairly low income tax, but there are huge numbers of point of use/sale taxes, fees, etc... that are stacked on top of those income taxes (realistically we pay over 50% of our wages in some kind of tax). You point this ut an people go nuts. They don;t take objection to the fact that we are dealing with such a large tax load, they take exception to the fatc that you are suggesting that america is ""not as good"" as other countries because our tax load is so high. This is not doing a very good job of watching the purse strings.","distinction","12:18 AM","government-debates","36"

I`m not so sure. If we look at the emphirical data, we can conclude that there has been many cases where socialistic or communistic countries have transformed into totalitarian states. And while this would suggest that it is in fact impossible to pursue the marxist dream without resorting to totalitarianism, it becomes a bit less convincing when you look at the details. First of all, Lenin re-defined and explored new areas of the marxist theory. One of his major points was that he claimed that the socialistic state should be governed by a revolutionary elite at first, as Russia was not ready for democracy. The same thing happened in China. This alone do not prove that it is possible to achieve democracy. It can easily be argued that this is a proof that socialism (as a transatory state to communism) is not possible with democracy, simply because the people will never be ""ready"". However, if we look at the reign of Allende in Chile, we can clearly see that it is indeed possible to pursue the marxist ""dream"" in a revolutionary fashion, without resorting to totalitarianism. The fact that the Chilean economy suffered quite heavily and the fact that Pinochet eventually seized power through violence do not change the fact that Allende proved that it is possible to combine socialism (as a transatory state to communism) and democracy.

If you want to use other definitions, please tell me, and we`ll work something out. Marxism: A school of thought. Socialism as a transatory state to communism: A state that owns all the means of production. True communism: The utopia that will arise once the socialistic state has withered waway (Ie; no government or state at all... think social-anarchism) Social democracy: A rather socio-liberal ideal that has its roots in marxist theory. Believes that market powers must be harnessed to serve the purpose of the society or collective. Believes in reforms rather than revolution. He feared that any attempt to overthrow the socialistic state could be bloody because the master class would not willingly abolish themsleves, regardless wether they where democraticly elected or not. Marx feared that the overthrowment of the liberal democracy would be bloody as well, not because it would not be in the interest of the political and numerical majority, but because the owners of the means of production and the political and economical elites of the liberal democracy would not allow it. I would not autmoaticly brand liberal democracies as traditional dictatorship, nor do I think that Marx would have either. In the early days of social democracy, I think you are correct. However, social democracy has evolved alot since then. I think there are few active social democrats today who would argue that all the means of production should be in the hands of the state. Only where it serves important purposes or where it is economicly efficient should the state own the means of production. This is often how social democratic countries have acted. Not by nationalising production of goods and services, but rather creating certain services and retaining some national control over certain important sectors (like Norway retaining national control of the oil production). It is a good question. Allthough I would argue that social democrats generally do not want the state to control all the means of production. But the question is still interesting as social democrats wants more (democratic) governmental control of the economy. ""Would then more governmental control lead to less democracy?"". From a scial democrats perspective, the answer would surely be no. After all, if the government is controlled by democratic majority, more governmental control would surely equal more democratic control, no?. Phew... I`ve been writing like a maniac all morning.

I see your point. I think you see my point. The final of which is: Communism and transatroy sociallism cannot work as they do not take into account the true nature of human beings. They, instead are based on a false assumption concerning people's abilities. After the fall of the USSR one of the main problems that they had was that they had no idea how to get people to obey laws or even to act charitably. They called upon church leaders from many nations to discuss the issue of morality and what governments could do to encourage this in their citizens. This is the point that socialism and communism cannot handle. The redistribution that happens is not according to effort or opportunity but need. It is forced charity (also known as tax, which we have been discussing in yet another thread). People naturally rebel against that which is forced. Democracy and capitalism take advantage of that fact. It is why there are so many dollars spent on advertising. Anyway, beyond this, my knowledge of true communism dwindles.

They are in place to control food prices. You cannot raise beef for $1 a pound without a large scale farm subsdies program. This was the topic of much debate at a recent world trade conference. Third world countries want developed coutries to cut their subsidies programs becasue they cannot compete pricewise with subsidised food.

Sorry about the late reply, but I hope your trip to Vegas was a good one. And yes, you are thinking along the right lines here. As for as governmental control over the economy, I think you can look at it as a sliding scale. With libertarians and various forms of anarchists at one end and communists at the other. Social democrats would be closer to the communists than for example liberals. But in some cases (or countries), conservatives would be closer to communists when it comes to governmental control. However, if you look at it more closely you`ll find that there are indeed some important differences between the different ideologies, even when it comes to governmental control. The agriculture sector is for example a very important sector for many conservatives. Protecting ones food production and the cultural tradition derived from this sector is paramount for the for the nations interests and protektionism is a common practice. But for social democrats, the agriculture sector is not important. In fact, one of the most historicly important issue for the swedish social democrats was abolishing tarriffs on agriculture products. I would however say that the US has far to ""go"" (or fall, depending on how you view it ) before the intensity of governmental control becomes close to modern social democratic standards. I would also argue that the US wellfare system is very different from those in european social democratic countries and it is legitimized on completly different grounds (most probably pure equal opportunity ideal, while social democracy would talk about lessening the class difference). Hmm.. don`t know if I made any sense","distinction","06:41 AM","government-debates","41"
"03-03-2004","1735",3,"daewoo","None","Ok, so besides the oil industry, what other idustries are generally government owned in social democratic systems? DOes the government own them directly, or is it sometimes a case of strict controls instead of outright ownership? Also, I would have to disagree thet welfare systems in America are an equal opportunity ideal. It seems that the welfare system in America is designed for the sole purpose of keeping the poor poor. Beside our standard welfare system, we have instituted a number of ""tax credits"" for poor people, and designed it so they get back more than they pay in, often tot he tune of thousands of dollars. In order to meet the criteria for these programs, you have to make beneath a certain threshold. The more you make, the less you get back. Interestingly enough, though, he way te system is set up, by if you make enough money to no longer get the credit, you are actualy loosing money overall because the additional money that you make does not make up for the lost credit. Also, currently in america, you make more money collecting government benifits such as wellfare, food stamps, etc... Than you would working a ob that pays minimum wage. To me this is not indicitive of a system set up on the ideals of equal opportunity, this is a system set up with the purpose of assisting the poor, but instead has done nothing but add to their ranks and ensure that muli-billion dollar comapnies have a large base of low end workers to choose from.","Eddie","37718","Hard to say actually. The oil example was about Norway. The equivalent sector in Sweden would be the wood industry, and even though the social democratic party in sweden has had the most substantial influence of any political party, the wood industry is owned by private interests. Governmental ownership is generally about wellfare institutions, such as the educational system, healthcare, power supply, public transportations etc. But even these sectors are being being challanged by the rising demands of economic efficiency, by some, attributed to increased internationalisation. But the privatisation ""wave"" has been followed by a large increase in regulations and strict control. So to answer your question... both I`m not saying that your assesment is wrong. After all, I don`t live in the US, but are you sure that the intentions of the democrats (regardless of outcome) is not equal oppurtunity? Too me, helping the poor sounds more like a conservative ideal than a liberal one. But I guess that is a political-culture difference","distinction","12:55 PM","government-debates","43"
