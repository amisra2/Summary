When I think of Democracy( America) it is oppressive to certain groups, yet offered too much Freedom, allowing lawless and excessively high crime rates of all natures","distinction","03:08 PM","government-debates","3"

How can you compare democracy to communism in regards to crime and oppression? It seems like the raw data would be a little difficult to come across, since there has never been a communist system in place. Did you perhaps mean to say ""socialism"" as opposed to ""communism""? Socialism and communism are two different things. I am not sure why people use the term interchangably. While the two do share some funadmental principals, they also share some pretty vast differences. It seems like, on paper, the two are radically different. Of course, the argument must stop there, as there has never been an implementation of communism that we can study. I would put forth that the current democracy in America does have some similarities to a socialist regime, such as massive taxes, widespread social programs and a firm belief by some in the need for ""social justice"". Beyond that, you are back into party politics. If you were talking about socialism, I hardly think that an over abundance of freedom in the socialist systems of government we have seen so far. Of course, if you want a look at a crime free society, you need simply study the soviet union before the fall of socialism. They had some of the lowest crime rates in the world. Of course, this was partly the result of their police tactics, and party the result of the cleansing of their society by the slaughter of ""undesirables"". I fail to see where you are leading with this. Could you please calrify?","distinction","09:19 PM","government-debates","5"

"02-12-2004","1735",1,"Broker","None","The US has massive taxes and social programs? The US is one of the lowest taxed Western countries period...","daewoo","34594","According to the Congressional Research Service, we spend $400 billion per year on social programs. 2/3 of that comes from federal funding. To me, $400 billion is a whole lot of money, and qualifies under the heading of ""massive"". Massive is, of course, a subjecive term, so to some people, $400 billion might not be massive. As far as the tax question, ""The US is one of the lowest taxed Western countries period"", should probably read ""The Us is one of the lowest taxed Western countries in regards to income taxes. According to the Tax Foundation, just calculating Federal income tax, State and local income taxes, Payroll taxes, employer portions of federal taxes and ""otehr federal taxes"", in 1998, Americans were loosing 39% of their income to some form of payroll collection tax. This doesn't even take into account sales taxers, transportation (fuel) taxes, food taxes, garbage collection taxes, and the whole myriad of other ""incidental"" taxes. The ""cost of government"" day in 2003 was july 11. I came up with this date by compariing ""cost of government day"" estimated from a dozen different sources and averaging the results. All the sources I saw used similar techniques to arrive at that date. All the sources I used attempted to use reliable estimation processes to establish estimations on point of sale taxes paid, and used recognised nationwide averages in calculating muicipal taxes. By my calculations, there are rougly 260 working days in a year, and approximatly 137 of those fall before the cost of government day. Assuming you make the same amount of money throughout the year (whic is a base assumtion in calculating cost of government day), that means that rougly 52.6% of your entire income is going to pay some type of tax. All of a sudden, the US numbers do not look so hot. To me, a 52% tax load is massive. Tht means you are working over half the year to pay uncle sam.","distinction","02:25 AM","government-debates","7"

Just like a paper cut is a milder form of being decapitated? How much milder is the question here. Both have similar roots in that they are forms of government so from what you have stated this is as far as the similarities may go in your opinion. Is this what you are refering to?","distinction","08:00 AM","government-debates","8"

(CIA world factbook 2002) If you would calculate how many percent of his earnings/wealth the average american would pay in taxes he would be even lower (as america is among the most wealthiest countries in the world) About democracy and communism This is really, really a stretch. I assume you are arguing that democracy is the dictatorship of the majority who uses force to oppress and extract resources from its citizens... First of all, if you take that stance, any political power (even the minimal state) is ""communism"", secondly; Unlike most communistic countries we have seen, (almost?) all democracies allows you to leave the country... If you are here vollentarily, how can it really be oppresive? (if oppresive is defined as (threat) of force to compell the population to adhere to certain rules and regulations)","distinction","06:30 AM","government-debates","11"
